1,cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of the malware headcrab that s known to target redis database servers across the world since early september 2021 the development  which comes exactly a year after the malware was first publicly disclosed by aqua  is a sign that the financially motivated threat actor behind the campaign is actively adapting and refining their tactics and techniques to stay ahead of the detection curve the cloud security firm said that  the campaign has almost doubled the number of infected redis servers   with an additional 1 100 compromised servers  up from 1 200 reported at the start of 2023 headcrab is designed to infiltrate internet exposed redis servers and wrangle them into a botnet for illicitly mining cryptocurrency  while also leveraging the access in a manner that allows the threat actor to execute shell commands  load fileless kernel modules  and exfiltrate data to a remote server while the origins of the threat actor are presently not known  they make it a point to note in a  mini blog  embedded into the malware that the mining activity is  legal in my country  and that they do it because  it almost doesn t harm human life and feelings  if done right   the operator  however  acknowledges that it s a  parasitic and inefficient way  of making money  adding their aim is to make  15 000 per year  an integral aspect of the sophistication of headcrab 2 0 lies in its advanced evasion techniques   aqua researchers asaf eitani and nitzan yaakov said   in contrast to its predecessor  named headcrab 1 0   this new version employs a fileless loader mechanism  demonstrating the attacker s commitment to stealth and persistence  it s worth noting that the previous iteration utilized the slaveof command to download and save the headcrab malware file to disk  thereby leaving artifact traces on the file system headcrab 2 0  on the other hand  receives the malware s content over the redis communication channel and stores it in a fileless location in a bid to minimize the forensic trail and make it much more challenging to detect also changed in the new variant is the use of the redis mget command for command and control  c2  communications for added covertness  by hooking into this standard command  the malware gains the ability to control it during specific attacker initiated requests   the researchers said  those requests are achieved by sending a special string as an argument to the mget command  when this specific string is detected  the malware recognizes the command as originating from the attacker  triggering the malicious c2 communication  describing headcrab 2 0 as an escalation in the sophistication of redis malware  aqua said its ability to masquerade its malicious activities under the guise of legitimate commands poses new problems for detection  this evolution underscores the necessity for continuous research and development in security tools and practices   the researchers concluded   the engagement by the attacker and the subsequent evolution of the malware highlights the critical need for vigilant monitoring and intelligence gathering  ,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.030205661430954933, 'security updates and patches': 0.06272190064191818, 'emerging threats and attack techniques': 0.7297651171684265, 'regulatory changes and compliance': 0.01596791483461857, 'data breaches and security incidents': 0.06188904121518135, 'news and industry updates': 0.08748114854097366, 'marketing': 0.01196932140737772}"
2,russian state sponsored actors have staged nt lan manager  ntlm  v2 hash relay attacks through various methods from april 2022 to november 2023  targeting high value targets worldwide the attacks

7,companies are engaged in a seemingly endless cat and mouse game when it comes to cybersecurity and cyber threats  as organizations put up one defensive block after another  malicious actors kick their game up a notch to get around those blocks  part of the challenge is to coordinate the defensive abilities of disparate security tools  even as organizations have limited resources and a dearth of skilled cybersecurity experts xdr  or extended detection and response  addresses this challenge  xdr platforms correlate indicators from across security domains to detect threats and then provide the tools to remediate incidents while xdr has many benefits  legacy approaches have been hampered by the lack of good quality data  you might end up having a very good view of a threat from events generated by your epp edr system but lack events about the network perspective  or vice versa   xdr products will import data from third party sensors  but data comes in different formats  the xdr platform needs to normalize the data  which then degrades its quality  as a result  threats may be incorrectly identified or missed  or incident reports may lack the necessary information for quick investigation and remediation cato s unique approach to reducing complexityall of which makes cato networks  approach to xdr particularly intriguing  announced in january  cato xdr is  as cato networks puts it  the first  sase based  xdr product  secure access service edge  sase  is an approach that converges security and networking into the cloud  sase would seem to be a natural fit for xdr as there are many native sensors already in a sase platform  gartner who defined sase in 2019 talks about a sase platform including  sd wan  swg  casb  ngfw and zero trust network access  ztna   but those are only the required capabilities  sase may also include advanced security capabilities such as remote browser isolation  network sandboxing  and dns protection  with so many native sensors already built into the sase platform  you could avoid the biggest problem with xdr – the lack of good data cato sase cloud is the prototypical example of what gartner means by sase and  on paper at least  cato xdr would tap the full power of what sase has to offer goal  the cato sase cloud comes with a rich set of native sensors spanning the network and endpoint    ngfw  advanced threat prevention  ips  ngam  and dns security   swg  casb  dlp  ztna  rbi  and epp edr  the latter  epp edr  is just as new as cato xdr  cato epp is built on bitdefender s malware prevention technology and stores customer and endpoint data in the same data lake as the rest of the cato sase network data  xdr users end up with an incredibly rich  surround sound  view  pardon the mixed metaphor  of an incident with detailed data gathered from many native sensors  cato s capabilities are instantly on and always available at scale  providing a single shared context to hunt for  detect  and respond to threats  for those who have their own epp edr solutions in place  cato can work for them as well  cato xdr integrates with leading edr providers such as microsoft defender  crowdstrike  and sentinelone testing environmentthe review is going to focus on a day in the life of a security analyst using cato xdr  we ll learn how an analyst can see a snapshot of the security threats on the network and the process for investigating and remediating them  in our scenario  we ve been informed of malware at 10 59 pm  we ll investigate and then remediate the incident it s important to understand that cato xdr is not sold as a standalone product  but as part of the larger cato sase cloud  it leverages all capabilities – sensors  analytics  ui and more – of the cato sase cloud  so  to fully appreciate cato xdr  one should be familiar with the rest of the cato platform to best appreciate the simplicity and – what cato calls  elegance  – of the platform  but doing so would make it difficult  if not impossible  to have room to review cato xdr  we chose to take a cursory look at cato overall but then focus on cato xdr   you can see a more complete albeit outdated review of the platform from back in 2017  getting into cato xdras we enter the cato sase cloud platform  they re greeted with a customized view of the enterprise network  security  access  and networking

that the stories dashboard has an intuitive and easy to use interface  making it simple to navigate and understand for security analysts of varying skill levels  we feel this is crucial for efficient investigations and decision making to get a quick understanding of the overall risk score of the account  we looked at the ai powered account risk score widget  in this case  the overall risk score is 75—so  fairly high  this tells us we need to dig in and see what s leading to such a high score  there are 55 incidents stories in all  24 of which are open and 30 of which are closed  the cato xdr stories dashboard summarizes the state of stories across the enterprise  across the top  ai is used to evaluate the overall risk of the account  1  with the status of the various stories and additional counters across vertical  2  below the overall summary line  we have widgets help us understand our stories from different perspectives  the highest priority stories are sorted by an ai powered criticality store  1   the score is based on all the story risk scores for the selected time range and is calculated using a formula developed by the cato research and development team  this is helpful in telling us which stories should be addressed first  we can also quickly see the hosts  top 5 hosts  and sites  top 5 sites  involved in the most stories  2   scrolling down we see additional graphs capturing the story breakdown by criticality  3   indicator of attack  ioa  such as malware activity  domain generation algorithm  dga   and suspicious network activity  4   and mitre att ck techniques  such as application layer protocol  exfiltration over c2 channel  and automated exfiltration mitigation  5   widgets help tell the threat story from different perspectives by

open  a click on the 24 open stories in the summary line of the stories dashboard brings us to the stories workbench page  also accessible from the navigation on the left side of the screen   which displays a prioritized list of all stories for efficient triage and better focus  cato uses an ai powered criticality score to rank the stories  1   we can also add more filters and narrow down the list even further to enable better focus in the filter row  2   grouping options also enable easier analysis  3   the stories workbench lists the available stories  which in this case is filtered to show the open stories ranked by criticality  1   further filtering  2  and grouping  3  options allow for efficient triage and investigation we decided to examine the distribution of threats in the stories workbench screen by grouping threats by their unique indications  now  we can see threats by category    malware activity  suspicious network activity  domain generation algorithm  dga   and so on  dga is a technique used by malware authors to dynamically generate many domain names  this is commonly employed by certain types of malware  such as botnets and other malicious software  to establish communication with command and control servers  we went to the final story at 10 59 pm and opened it for investigation  the stories workbench screen grouped by indications  showing the stories with domain generation algorithms  dgas   we investigated the final dga story the investigation screen shows a methodological process with tools for analyzing threats from the top down  gaining a high level understanding of situation and then delving deeper into the investigation  first is the summary line of the story  1   we can see that the type of attack detected is domain generation algorithm  that this is a threat hunting story  and that the number of associated signals  which are the network flows that make up the story  is 26  threat hunting stories contain correlated security events and network flows and using ai ml and threat hunting heuristics to detect elusive signatureless and zero day threats that cannot be blocked by prevention tools we can see that the story duration is nine days  indicating that we found associated signals within a time span of nine days  and of course  that the status of the story is open  next  we see the status line

quickly see that the domain generation algorithm  or dga  was found on robin s host 7  we see that the attack direction is outbound  and the ai powered criticality score is 5 for an easy to read understanding of the story  we can click on the  see summary  button  cato s gen ai engine summarizes the results of the screen in easy to read text  details include the type of communication  the ip

the screen using cato s gen ai engine closing the story summary and staying on the investigation screen  we gain additional insights about the story  cato s machine learning powered predicted verdict analyzes the various indicators in the story and based on previous knowledge provides an expected verdict  1   another smart insight is the  similar stories   which is also powered by ai and  when relevant  will link to stories with similar characteristics  there s also the playbook knowledge base  highlighted  to guide us on how to investigate stories of malicious target communication on the right side of the screen  we can see the source details  2   the ip  the os  and the client  we see that this is a tor browser  which can be suspicious  tor is a web browser specifically designed for privacy and anonymity  and attackers often use it to conceal their identity and activity online we can see the attack geolocation source  3   which communicates with different countries on different parts of the map  this can also be suspicious  next  we look at the target actions box  4  where we can see actions that relate to every target involved in this story  since this is a threat hunting story  we can see a correlation between a broad set of signals scrolling down we examine the attack distribution timeline  we can see here that the communication to the targets has been going on for nine days  the attack distribution timeline provides a chronological list of the attacks on the various targets  clicking on the targets allows analysts to add or remove them from the graphic to better see the attack pattern by filtering out some of the targets  we can see patterns of communications  which are easily observable  we clearly see a periodic activity that is indicative of bot  or script  initiated communication  under the attack timeline  the targets table  1  provides additional details about the targets  including their ips  domain names  and related threat intelligence  the targets are sorted by malicious score  this is a smart score powered by ai and ml that takes all of cato s threat intelligence sources  both proprietary and third party  and calculates the score between zero and one to indicate whether the ip is considered highly malicious or not  removing all but four of the targets show a periodic communication pattern  which is indicative of a bot or script  below the attack distribution timelines is the targets table with extensive information about the targets in the investigation the popularity column shows if the ip is  popular  or  unpopular  as determined by cato s proprietary algorithm measuring how often an ip or domain is visited according to cato internal data  unpopular ips or domains are often indicative of suspicious ips or domains  we can gain external threat intelligence information about the target by clicking third party threat intelligence links such as virustotal  whois  and abusepdb  external threat intelligence sources are just a click away from within the targets table scrolling down to the attack related flows table  we can view more granular details about the raw network flows that compose the story  such as the start time of the traffic and the source and destination ports  in this particular case  the destination ports are unusually high  9001  and less common  which raises a red flag documenting what we found with catolet s summarize our findings from our test case  we found suspicious network activity related to domain generation algorithm that uses the tor client  the ip has low popularity  high malicious scoring  and the communication follows a specific pattern in distinct times  so  we can now reach a conclusion  we suspect that there is a malware installed on the source endpoint  robin s host 7  and that it s trying to communicate outside using tor infrastructure now let s set up the verdict in the screen below  we ll classify the story as malicious  the analyst severity would be medium  the type is anonymizer  we can see the details in the image below  the classification would be dga  then we can save the verdict on this incident story  the security analyst can document a verdict to help others understand the threat once saved  we can see that that opening threat hunting screen has been updated  the second row now shows that the analyst has set the severity to medium  and the verdict is set to malicious  now the response would be to mitigate the threat by configuring a firewall rule mitigate the threat with catonormally  analysts would need to jump to another platform to take action  but in the case of cato it can all be done right in the xdr platform  a block rule can be easily created in cato s internet firewall to prevent the spread of the malware  we copy the target domain that appears in the attack network flows  add the domain to the app category section of the firewall rule  and hit apply  worldwide the dga domain is now blocked  the updated cato firewall screen with the rule blocking access to the dga generated domain conclusionwith its introduction of sase based xdr  cato networks promised to vastly simplify threat detection  incident response  and endpoint protection  they appear to uphold the promise  the test case scenario we ran through above should take an experienced security analyst less than 20 minutes from start to mitigation  and that was with no setup time or implementation or data collection efforts  the data was already there in the data lake of the sase platform cato networks has successfully extended the

8,nearly 4 year old cisco vuln linked to recent akira ransomware attacksevidence mounts of an exploit gatekept within russia s borderssecurity researchers believe the akira ransomware group could be exploiting a nearly four year old cisco vulnerability and using it as an entry point into organizations  systems in eight of security company truesec s most recent incident response engagements that involved akira and cisco s anyconnect ssl vpn as the entry point  at least six of the devices were running versions vulnerable to cve 2020 3259  which was patched in may 2020 the vulnerability lies in the web services interface of cisco adaptive security appliance  asa  and cisco firepower threat defense  ftd  software  allowing attackers to extract secrets stored in memory in clear text such as usernames and passwords – à la citrixbleed truesec said that because there is no publicly available exploit code for the cisco vulnerability  it means cybercriminals like those working for akira would either need to have bought that exploit from somewhere or developed one of their own  which would require a deep understanding of the flaw akira is long known to be targeting cisco vpns as the initial access vector for ransomware attacks  but the possible exploitation of the old vulnerability is the new finding here analysis of past cases has been stymied by the  generally non existent  network logs in environments  according to heresh zaremand  senior consultant at truesec  and these were barely even enough to pinpoint anyconnect as the point of access in one recent incident  however  the truesec team managed to restore six months of radius authentication logs from an nps server  the analysis of which revealed a pattern of malicious behavior that heavily hinted towards but didn t quite prove the use of an exploit the researchers  observations that suggested the likely use of an exploit included  attackers authenticating using genuine credentials that had recently been used by the real account holder eight different accounts were compromised  though only two were used for lateral movement compromised accounts had distinct usernames that didn t follow any predictable naming conventions  and all used unique passwords no evidence of phishing campaigns targeting the organization no evidence of password attacks in the restored logs no evidence of the credentials for sale on the dark webzaremand said there was no way of determining what data an attacker had accessed following an exploit  and that if they did get in  they likely exploited the device multiple times to access different parts of its memory content  if your organization is running cisco anyconnect  and assuming the device has been patched since a fix for cve 2020 3259 was available  it is highly recommended that you backtrack when your device was upgraded to a non vulnerable version   he added   akira ransomware gang says it stole passport scans from lush in 110 gb data heist  cybercrooks play dress up as  helpful  researchers in latest ransomware ruse  stanford schooled in cybersecurity after akira claims ransomware attack  ransomware fiends pounce on cisco vpn brute force zero day flaw this is important as it is not possible to determine for how long this vulnerability has been exploited  for instance  if your backtracking shows that your devices were upgraded six months ago  then it is sound to consider any username and password used for the anyconnect ssl vpn which has not changed in the last six months as compromised  in such cases  organizations are advised to initiate broad password resets and consider any other secrets or pre shared keys in the device s configuration compromised enabling mfa is the de facto advice given to organizations following an attack  and  of course  apply the patches if you haven t already russia s  prints all over it when cve 2020 3259 was disclosed  there were no known publicly available exploits  and that remains true to this day the vulnerability was discovered by russian security research outfit positive technologies in 2020  which was placed on the us sanctions list a year later  according to the us treasury  positive technologies helped russian intelligence  fsb  with its security services and helped run conventions the fsb used as recruitment events zaremand said truesec wasn t suggesting there are any ties between akira and russian intelligence  but offensive security research does appear to end up in the hands of both cybercriminals and nation states he also pointed to the widely held belief that akira  which recently claimed an attack on cosmetics giant lush  is an offshoot born from conti s demise in 2022  and that conti itself was thought to have had ties to the fsb  ®,emerging threats and attack

electrical grid  our oil and natural gas pipelines  our transportation systems — and the risk that poses to every american requires our attention   fbi director christopher wray told the house select committee on competition with china the hearing coincided with the fbi s confirmation that it obtained search warrants and issued a remote kill command to wipe volt typhoon s botnet after the chinese crew infected hundreds of end of life routers and attempted to break into american critical infrastructure targets after breaking into victims  routers the volt typhoon crew evades detection by using legitimate ip addresses and credentials  plus other tools to communicate with their spymasters and move throughout the target environment such incidents are no longer a  theoretical threat   added us cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency director jen easterly  noting that cisa has seen volt typhoon  burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to enabled active attacks in the event of a major crisis   this is a world major crisis halfway across the planet  could well endanger the lives of americans here at home  through the disruption of our pipelines  the severing of our telecommunications  the pollution of our water facilities  the crippling of our transportation modes  all to ensure that they can incite societal panic and chaos  and to deter our ability to marshal military might and civilian will   she added earlier reports suggested that american government officials were worried that this nation state group was biding its time and planning to disrupt military installations  utilities and internet service providers if china invaded taiwan and the us provided support for the island nation  their aim is clear  in the early stages of a conflict  they want to disrupt our military s ability to mobilize  and to impact the systems that allow us to thrive in our increasingly digital world   said harry coker jr  director of the office of the national cyber director  this puts critical infrastructure owners and operators  the vast majority of whom are private organizations   on the front lines   he added but in addition to attacking us energy grids or water systems  which would likely incite a kinetic war  china also has less overtly destructive cybertools at its disposal including disinformation  spread via tiktok and other social media  and ai capabilities such as deepfakes intending to sway us elections these aren t easy problems to solve  as wray has repeatedly noted — and did again in front of the house panel — chinese cyber spies

join in   five eyes and microsoft accuse china of attacking us infrastructure again  us cyber spymaster calls tiktok china s  trojan horse the us agency directors also told lawmakers the us needs better partnerships and threat sharing between the private sector and the government  as well as government agencies setting clear cybersecurity requirements and providing assistance to victim organizations in addition to these challenges  there s the ongoing cybersecurity skills shortage  which coker said includes half a million open infosec jobs fixing these problems also requires holding software companies liable for buggy products  according to easterly  this is a battle cry that easterly repeated during her cisa tenure  the agency wants vendors to make their tech  secure by design   so it s safe out of the box  and this responsibility isn t passed on to businesses and end users  unfortunately  the technology underpinning our critical infrastructure is inherently insecure because of decades of software developers not being held liable for defective technology that has led to incentives where features and speed to market have been prioritized against security  leaving our nation vulnerable to cyber invasion   easterly told the house subcommittee  technology manufacturers must ensure that china and other cyber actors cannot exploit the weaknesses in our technology  to

13,the usa government on wednesday said it took steps to neutralize a botnet comprising hundreds of usa based small office and home office  soho  routers hijacked by a china linked state sponsored threat actor called volt typhoon and blunt the impact posed by the hacking campaign the existence of the botnet  dubbed kv botnet  was first disclosed by the black lotus labs team at lumen technologies in mid december 2023  the law enforcement effort was reported by reuters earlier this week  the vast majority of routers that comprised the kv botnet were cisco and netgear routers that were vulnerable because they had reached  end of life  status  that is  they were no longer supported through their manufacturer s security patches or other software updates   the department of justice  doj  said in a press statement volt typhoon  aka dev 0391  bronze silhouette  insidious taurus  or vanguard panda  is the moniker assigned to a china based adversarial collective that has been attributed to cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in the usa and guam  chinese cyber actors  including a group known as  volt typhoon   are burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to be ready to launch destructive cyber attacks in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the united states   cisa director jen easterly noted the cyber espionage group  believed to be active since 2021  is known for its reliance on legitimate tools and living off the land  lotl  techniques to fly under the radar and persist within victim environments for extended periods of time to gather sensitive information another important aspect of its modus operandi is that it tries to blend into normal network activity by routing traffic through compromised soho network equipment  including routers  firewalls  and vpn hardware  in an attempt to obfuscate their origins this is accomplished by means of the kv botnet  which commandeers devices from cisco  draytek  fortinet  and netgear for use as a covert data transfer network for advanced persistent threat actors  it s suspected that the botnet operators offer their services to other hacking outfits  including volt typhoon in january 2024  a report from cybersecurity firm securityscorecard revealed how the botnet has been responsible for compromising as much as 30  — or 325 of 1 116 — of end of life cisco rv320 325 routers over a 37 day period from december 1  2023  to january 7  2024  volt typhoon is at least one user of the kv botnet and       this botnet encompasses a subset of their operational infrastructure   lumen black lotus labs said  adding the botnet  has been active since at least february 2022  the company told the hacker news that kv botnet was operated separately  with the threat actors behind it performing their own reconnaissance and targeting  while also supporting multiple groups like volt typhoon the botnet is also designed to download a virtual private network  vpn  module to the vulnerable routers and set up a direct encrypted communication channel to control the botnet and use it as an intermediary relay node to achieve their operational goals  one function of the kv botnet is to transmit encrypted traffic between the infected soho routers  allowing the hackers to anonymize their activities  i e   the hackers appear to be operating from the soho routers  versus their actual computers in china    according to affidavits filed by the usa federal bureau of investigation  fbi  as part of its efforts to disrupt the botnet  the agency said it remotely issued commands to target routers in the usa using the malware s communication protocols to delete the kv botnet payload and prevent them from being re infected  the fbi said it also notified every victim about the operation  either directly or via their internet service provider if contact information was not available  the court authorized operation deleted the kv botnet malware from the routers and took additional steps to sever their connection to the botnet  such as blocking communications with other devices used to control the botnet   the doj added it s important to point out here that the unspecified prevention measures employed to remove the routers from the botnet are temporary and cannot survive a reboot  in other words  simply restarting the devices would render them susceptible to re infection  the volt typhoon malware enabled china to hide  among other things  pre operational reconnaissance and network exploitation against critical infrastructure like our communications  energy  transportation  and water sectors – steps china was taking  in other words  to find and prepare to destroy or degrade the civilian critical infrastructure that keeps us safe and prosperous   fbi director christopher wray said however  the chinese government  in a statement shared with reuters  denied any involvement in the attacks  dismissing it as a  disinformation campaign  and that it  has been categorical in opposing hacking attacks and the abuse of information technology  coinciding with the takedown  the usa cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency  cisa  published new guidance urging soho device manufacturers to embrace a secure by design approach during development and shift the burden away from customers specifically  it s recommending that manufacturers eliminate exploitable defects in soho router web management interfaces and modify default device configurations to support automatic update capabilities and require a manual override to remove security settings the compromise of edge devices such as routers for use in advanced persistent attacks mounted by russia and china highlights a growing problem that s compounded by the fact that legacy devices no longer receive security patches and do not support endpoint detection and response  edr  solutions  the creation of products that lack appropriate security controls is unacceptable given the current threat environment   cisa said   this case exemplifies how a lack of secure by design practices can lead to real world harm both to customers and  in this case  our

15,ransomware payment rates drop to new low – now  only 29  of victims  fork over cashit s almost like years of false assurances have made people realize payments are pointlesstrusting a ransomware crew to honor a deal isn t the greatest idea  and the world seems to be waking up to that  it s claimed that number of victims who chose to pay dropped to a new low of 29 percent in the last quarter of 2023 the data from ransomware response and negotiation company coveware continues a downward trend since it began monitoring in 2019  when it said the rate of companies choosing to pay ransomware actors was a whopping 85 percent  the reason for the change  coveware founder and ceo bill siegel states in the company s latest quarterly report  comes down to awareness not only are more ransomware victims prepared for the inevitability of attacks by keeping better backups  siegel points out  but several years of ransomware making top headlines – and associated stories of payments amounting to nothing – have led to a reluctance to trust data kidnappers there s just no honor among thieves  it seems – even digital ones  q4 was rife with examples of how data assurances can fail  even when interacting with well known  brand established  ransomware groups   siegel says   threat actors cannot be trusted to prevent ongoing misuse publication of stolen data  and … payments to them for these imaginary assurances have zero if not sub zero value  along with a decrease in overall ransomware payments  coveware found that payments for data exfiltration only incidents also hit an all time low since it began tracking them in 2022  while 53 percent of companies were paying such demands two years ago  only 26 percent did so in the fourth quarter of 2023 further proof a ransomware payment ban is a bad movecoveware s takeaway is that the world is making progress in dealing with ransomware that a payment ban would completely undo  a ban would signal that as a country  we are admitting that we are incapable of defending ourselves   siegel states  he adds that early experiments with payment bans have been largely ineffective  the report cites a florida ban on ransomware payments that took effect on july 1  2022  noting that  we have not yet seen a decline in attacks inside  florida and other  states  that have enacted a payment ban  like north carolina   us officials close to persuading allies to not pay off ransomware crooks  ransomware payment ban  wrong idea at the wrong time  formal ban on ransomware payments  asking orgs nicely to not cough up ain t working  be honest  would you pay off a ransomware crew instead  siegel offered reporting requirements  like those enacted by the us securities and exchange commission and the federal trade commission  as a major reason for the progress  if a nationwide payment ban were enacted  that progress would be unpicked  the report argues  there would still be demand for ransom payment services because people and organizations will do what they must to survive   says siegel  enact a payment ban  and compliance with reporting rules may decrease as companies make payments through offshore accounts and  re order the flow of money through a new illegal market of service providers  like ransomware criminals themselves  illegal service providers could easily take the money and run safe harbors  encouraging companies to work with law enforcement  and more awareness of how to stay safe is the key  coveware insists  greater costs must be imposed on the threat actors by changing the incentives of the victims   siegel says in the report   carrots and sticks are necessary   ®,news and industry updates,regulatory changes and compliance,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.018893228843808174, 'security updates and patches': 0.01448514498770237, 'emerging threats and attack techniques': 0.11612941324710846, 'regulatory changes and compliance': 0.47502419352531433, 'data breaches and security incidents': 0.10748040676116943, 'news and industry updates': 0.2610175311565399, 'marketing': 0.006970055401325226}"

commissioner rebecca slaughter  and commissioner alvaro bedoya blasted blackbaud – a cloud software provider for schools  charities  and other orgs – for its  unfair and deceptive data security practices  in a statement  pdf   the ftc charges that blackbaud s reckless data retention practices rendered its security failures much more costly  by hoarding reams of data that it did not reasonably need  blackbaud s breach exposed far more data   they said  moreover  blackbaud s notification alerting victims of the breach included false statements  which blackbaud did not correct until months later — and months after it knew the statements were false  back in february 2020  according to a formal complaint  pdf  raised by the ftc  criminals broke into blackbaud s databases  remained undetected for three months  and stole files on about 13 000 of the biz s customers  those files contained  the personal information of millions of consumers   the regulator saidafter being detected  the intruders extorted the software maker  and blackbaud allegedly agreed to pay the miscreants about  235 000 to quietly go away and delete any pilfered documents  according to the ftc complaint  however  blackbaud wasn t able to verify that the crims really did scrap the swiped data then  in june 2020  the biz finally got around to alerting its customers about the privacy breach  at the time it assured them   the cybercriminal did not access credit card information  bank account information  or social security numbers  this turned out to be false  we re told  according to the ftc  blackbaud knew as early as july 31  2020   that the attacker had exfiltrated consumers  bank account numbers and social security numbers   the business didn t  however  disclose that to customers until october 2020   cloud biz blackbaud caved to ransomware gang s demands – then neglected to inform customers for two months   we stopped ransomware  boasts blackbaud ceo  and by  stopped  he means

march 2023  blackbaud agreed to pay  3 million to settle charges brought by america s financial watchdog the sec accusing the it player of making misleading statements about its security fiasco then in october that year  attorneys general from all 50 us states secured another  49 5 million settlement over blackbaud s  deficient data security practices and inadequate response  to the network breach as part of this latest settlement  pdf   brokered with the ftc  blackbaud has agreed to delete or destroy customer backup files containing sensitive information that is not needed to provide products or services to these customers  that s supposed to reduce the risk of personal data being stolen in future blackbaud also agreed to publicize its updated data retention policy  outlining what specific customer info it maintains  why the outfit has it  and give a solid timeframe for deleting these files plus  the firm has to put into place an overhauled infosec program that includes  among other things  multi factor authentication  data loss tools  penetration testing  and encryption of  at a minimum  customers  social security numbers  passport numbers  tax ids  driving licenses and other government issued identification  plus bank account  credit card  and debit card information  dates of birth  medical information  and user account credentials that last part is important because  according to the watchdog  blackbaud s failure to encrypt sensitive data  plus holding onto this information for far longer than was necessary  made the security breach far worse than it would have been otherwise a blackbaud spokesperson told the register the company neither admits nor denies any of the ftc s allegations in its proposed settlement  which is awaiting final sign off from the regulator  we are pleased to resolve this matter with the ftc   said mike gianoni  president and ceo  blackbaud   protecting our customers  and their constituents  privacy will always be of

 noting  we are not aware of any other thefts from crypto businesses on this scale  on these dates   it therefore appears likely that ftx is the  victim company 1  named in the indictment   elliptic

22,cloudflare sheds more light on thanksgiving security breach in which tokens  source code accessed by suspected spiesatlassian systen compromised via october okta intrusioncloudflare has just detailed how suspected government spies gained access to its internal atlassian installation using credentials stolen via a security breach at okta in october in a write up on thursday  ceo matthew prince  cto john graham cumming  and ciso grant bourzikas said the atlassian intrusion was detected all the way back on thanksgiving day  november 23  2023  and that the trespassers were ejected the following day the october okta security breach involved more than 130 customers of that it access management biz  in which snoops swiped data from okta in hope of drilling further into those organizations  cloudflare was among those affected  as it was in 2022 as a result of a separate okta intrusion cloudflare acknowledged in october it was caught up in okta s latest security meltdown  and is now disclosing more details about what happened the intruders – likely agents of a nation state  according to prince et al – obtained one service token and three service account credentials through that 2023 okta compromise  at the time  okta indicated that information stolen from its customer support systems was pretty benign  and could be used in things like phishing or social engineering attacks  it turns out that session tokens  granting access into networks of the likes of cloudflare  were taken from okta s systems  one was a moveworks service token that granted remote access into our atlassian system   said prince  graham cumming  and bourzikas on that note  the second credential was a service account used by the saas based smartsheet application that had administrative access to our atlassian jira instance  the third account was a bitbucket service account which was used to access our source code management system  and the fourth was an aws environment that had no access to the global network and no customer or sensitive data  because cloudflare incorrectly believed those tokens were unused  it failed to rotate them  so the thief or thieves were able to use them to gain access to cloudflare s systems   okta data breach dilemma dwarfs earlier estimates  okta october breach affected 134 orgs  biz admits  cloudflare exiles baseboard management controller from its server motherboards  cloudflare defends firing of staffer for reasons hr could not explainfrom november 14  2023 through november 17  2023  the intruders appear to have been probing cloudflare s systems  doing reconnaissance through its confluence based internal wiki  and its jira bug database further accesses were detected on november 20 and 21  following by the establishment of a persistence presence in the cloud corp s atlassasian server via scriptrunner for jira  having administrative access to jira via the smartsheet service  the snoops were able to install the sliver adversary emulation framework  a common tool for command and control connectivity and backdoor access the intruders also gained access to cloudflare s bitbucket source code management system  but efforts to access a console server linked to a not yet active datacenter in são paulo  brazil failed the intruders  according to the cloud giant  scoured the biz s wiki for information about remote access  secrets  and tokens  also of interest were 36 jira tickets  out of more than two million  that focused on vulnerability management  secret rotation  multi factor authentication bypass  network access  and even the biz s response to the okta incident this attack was performed by a nation state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to cloudflare’s global networkthe spies  interest in secrets was also evident in the 120 bitbucket code repositories viewed out of a total of almost 12 000  some 76 of the 120 were downloaded to the atlassian server  while cloudflare is uncertain whether these were exfiltrated  it s treating them as such  these repos were mostly related to the way backups work  global network configuration and management  identity  remote access  and terraform and kubernetes  a few contained encrypted secrets and those were immediately rotated even though they were strongly encrypted  according to the us cdn giant  even though we understand the operational impact of the incident to be extremely limited  we took this incident very seriously because a threat actor had used stolen credentials to get access to our atlassian server and accessed some documentation and a limited amount of source code   said prince et al  based on our collaboration with colleagues in the industry and government  we believe that this attack was performed by a nation state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to cloudflare’s global network  cloudflare managed to expel the attackers by november 24  2023  and set about assessing the damage and investigating what happened  three days later  a company wide remediation effort dubbed  code red  became the focus of much of its technical staff  and this project was assisted by external security firm crowdstrike  which carried out an independent assessment of the cyber assault code red concluded on january 5  2024  but

23,ignore uncle sam s  voluntary  cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your perilwhat is on hhs paper will most likely become law  google security boss saysinterview if you are responsible for infosec at an american hospital or other healthcare organization  and you treat the us government s new  voluntary  cybersecurity performance goals  cpgs  as  well  voluntary  you re ignoring the writing on the wall plus  you re going to be in for a world of hurt when new regulations – which will very likely mirror these voluntary practices – take effect  according to taylor lehmann  a director in google cloud s office of the chief information security officer  the benefit of the cpg is that it indicates where the ball is bouncing next  and what the standards and expectations are for what organizations should be working on   lehmann told the register lehmann  a former ciso of athenahealth and tufts medicine  said the proof is in previous federal agency rulemaking processes  it may not be today  but what is on hhs paper will most likely become what is in the actual final rulemaking or new regulatory requirements that become law   he said   if you buy into the fact that voluntary doesn t mean you have to do something  you are probably going to be wrong  voluntary goals become mandatory  and that has usually been the case with other rulemaking in healthcare as it relates to security  in early january  as a record breaking 46 health networks with a total of 141 hospitals between them were still reeling from ransomware infections and data theft in 2023  rumors started swirling that the white house would soon require us hospitals to meet basic cybersecurity standards before receiving federal funding during all of this  the criminals behind the intrusions were using their own increasingly dangerous extorion methods to force hospitals to pay ransom demands when asked about the hospital rules  the centers for medicare and medicaid services directed the register to a concept paper published in december that outlines the department of health and human services   hhs  cybersecurity strategy according to the paper  pdf   officials will propose new  enforceable security standards  and will work with congress to administer financial support and incentives for hospitals to implement  high impact cybersecurity practices   among other actions later in january  hhs released the voluntary  healthcare specific cpgs essential doesn t mean easythese goals are divided into two categories  essential and enhanced  and each has ten specific things that organizations can do to better protect themselves from cyberattacks the essential goals sound like base level security – the kind of things one would hope that hospitals and clinics already have in place but  according to lehmann  they are all based on real world exploits and compromises   basically what the sector experienced over the last year   he said   i d love to say these are super obvious  but clearly they are not all being done  they include mitigating known vulnerabilities  using multi factor authentication  implementing email security  training employees in secure behaviors  encrypting sensitive data  and revoking credentials for employees  contractors  and volunteers when they leave the organization basic incident response planning  using unique credentials  separating user and privileged accounts  and assessing vendor and supplier risks round out the essential goals  the point is  basics aren t always necessarily easy  the basics can be super hard   lehmann said   uncle sam tells hospitals  meet security standards or no federal dollars for you  lockbit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children s hospital   exemplar  digital hospitals trust hit by multiple tech related traumas  after injecting cancer hospital with ransomware  crims threaten to swat patientshealthcare networks  especially those with clinics and hospitals in smaller  rural communities  aren t running modern technology stacks  some of their equipment is decades old  and they can t afford to upgrade it or hire enough employees to support their security goals  the tech debt has stacked up for years  and to overcome it  in many cases  will put organizations out of business   lehmann said   it happened this summer  he s referring to an illinois hospital that said it would shut down in part because of a ransomware infection this isn t to say large hospitals are immune from ransomware or other cyberattacks  case in point  commonspirit health  america s second largest nonprofit healthcare org  diverted ambulances and shut down electronic record systems at its facilities and hospitals across 21 states  we re going to keep struggling – that is  until the point where hhs steps in  which is what they have alluded to doing   lehmann said still  implementing even the essential goals like multi factor authentication  for example  can present difficulties  how are you going to get 15 000 people to do two factor authentication enrollment in a window of time  and with appropriate resourcing  to make sure if a catastrophic event occurs and we re in the middle of a two factor enrollment  that we don t have to shut the hospital down  if these things aren t done well  they can have catastrophic operational impacts on really sensitive life saving things   lehmann said another of the essential goals – revoking credentials when people leave the organization – isn t as easy as it sounds either  not if you re an academic medical system where you ve got five or more academic institutions  and you don t know when those students graduate  you don t know when they leave   lehmann said he added that the essential goals do  miss the point  a bit by focusing primarily on preventing attacks  instead of equally prioritizing resilience and recovery  for too long  data confidentiality  and protecting patient s pii and health information  has been seen as the only goal in securing healthcare because failing to protect confidential information is what gets hospitals in trouble with government agencies  availability is equally important  if not more important  than confidentiality   lehmann said  adding that many healthcare orgs haven t yet progressed to this way of thinking about security   i care if my data gets breached  but i care more if i die because of it

24,cloudflare has revealed that it was the target of a likely nation state attack in which the threat actor leveraged stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to its atlassian server and ultimately access some documentation and a limited amount of source code the intrusion  which took place between november 14 and 24  2023  and detected on november 23  was carried out  with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to cloudflare s global network   the web infrastructure company said  describing the actor as  sophisticated  and one who  operated in a thoughtful and methodical manner  as a precautionary measure  the company further said it rotated more than 5 000 production credentials  physically segmented test and staging systems  carried out forensic triages on 4 893 systems  reimaged and rebooted every machine across its global network the incident involved a four day reconnaissance period to access atlassian confluence and jira portals  following which the adversary created a rogue atlassian user account and established persistent access to its atlassian server to ultimately obtain access to the bitbucket source code management system by means of the sliver adversary simulation framework as many as 120 code repositories were viewed  out of which 76 are estimated to have been exfiltrated by the attacker  the 76 source code repositories were almost all related to how backups work  how the global network is configured and managed  how identity works at cloudflare  remote access  and our use of terraform and kubernetes   cloudflare said  a small number of the repositories contained encrypted secrets which were rotated immediately even though they were strongly encrypted themselves  the threat actor is then said to have unsuccessfully attempted to  access a console server that had access to the data center that cloudflare had not yet put into production in são paulo  brazil  the attack was made possible by using one access token and three service account credentials associated with amazon web services  aws   atlassian bitbucket  moveworks  and smartsheet that were stolen following the october 2023 hack of okta s support case management system cloudflare acknowledged that it had failed to rotate these credentials  mistakenly assuming they were unused the company also said it took steps to terminate all malicious connections originating from the threat actor on november 24  2023  it also involved cybersecurity firm crowdstrike to perform an independent assessment of the incident  the only production systems the threat actor could access using the stolen credentials was our atlassian environment  analyzing the wiki pages they accessed  bug database issues  and source code repositories  it appears they were looking for information about the architecture  security  and management of our global network   cloudflare said ,data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.06352369487285614, 'security updates and patches': 0.039575446397066116, 'emerging threats and attack techniques': 0.22258546948432922, 'regulatory changes and compliance': 0.028503237292170525, 'data breaches and security incidents': 0.5385748744010925, 'news and industry updates': 0.08707472681999207, 'marketing': 0.020162517204880714}"
25,ivanti releases patches for vpn zero days  discloses two more high severity vulnsmany versions still without fixes while sophisticated attackers bypass mitigationsivanti has finally released the first round of patches for vulnerability stricken connect secure and policy secure gateways  but in doing so has also found two additional zero days  one of which is under active exploitation the news comes days after ivanti  which releases its patches on a staggered schedule  said the first batch of fixes – due last week – was delayed  and many versions remain without official fixes patches are now available for versions 9 1r14 4  9 1r17 2  9 1r18 3  22 4r2 2  22 5r1 1  and zta version 22 6r1 3  which will be welcome news to admins fearful of becoming the next target among a growing number of victims admins are advised  out of an abundance of caution  to also factory reset their devices before applying the patch  this is to prevent any possibility of an attacker gaining upgrade persistence  ivanti said the process will take up to four hours to complete given the state of exploitation of these vulnerabilities  it goes without saying that these patches should be applied as soon as possible to recap  earlier this month security researchers at volexity disclosed the two bug zero day exploit they believed to be carried out by an unknown group with a suspected china nexus  the researchers said the vulnerabilities make it  trivial  for remote unauthenticated attackers to achieve code execution at the time  ivanti said fewer than ten victims were believed to have been breached but this quickly increased and was under mass exploitation within days ivanti also said it would develop patches not by version order  but according to the version with the most installs  patches were expected to drop between january 22 and february 19  but some of these have since been delayed slightly customers in the meantime were advised to apply the mitigation available via the ivanti download portal and use the external version of ivanti s internal integrity checker  ict   alongside proactive threat hunting practices to monitor for suspected compromises to make matters worse  this week the us cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency  cisa  said ivanti s mitigation was bypassed by some sophisticated attackers  threat actors are continuing to leverage vulnerabilities in ivanti connect secure and policy secure gateways to capture credentials and or drop webshells that enable further compromise of enterprise networks   the alert reads  some threat actors have recently developed workarounds to current mitigations and detection methods and have been able to exploit weaknesses  move laterally  and escalate privileges without detection  cisa is aware of instances in which sophisticated threat actors have subverted the external ict  further minimizing traces of their intrusion  cisa suggests organizations should continue to proactively hunt for threats to systems connected to vulnerable ivanti devices  it also advised monitoring account authentication  usage  and identity management services that could be exposed  isolating them from enterprise resources where possible in releasing today s round of patches  ivanti also updated its mitigation in a bid to keep attackers at bay for now  this can be applied via the download portal

that cve 2024 21888 is under active exploitation  but a small number of customers have been hit by the server side request forgery flaw it s not clear if the discovery of these two additional

previously identified vulnerabilities in the patch released today  and patches planned for release for additional versions will also include a comprehensive fix  and the patches released on january 31 cover the majority of our customers  we have also provided a new mitigation in the best interest of customers while the remaining patch versions are in development  we strongly encourage customers to

26,how f5 distributed cloud services seal security gaps in modern app development amid growing attack surfacepartner content application programming interfaces  apis  play a significant role in today s digital economy  but at the same time they can also represent a data security vulnerability while apis serve as building blocks to modern app development  their proliferation and sprawl have also been exploited by bad actors targeting web apps to initiate data breaches  account takeover  fraud and other threats api endpoints increase an application s attack surface area and introduce vulnerabilities and compliance issues that traditional app security tools struggle to mitigate  compounding the problem are the countless outdated or undocumented apis  dubbed shadow apis  that connect to applications which organizations have long forgotten or hardly ever use  many of these were built to facilitate internal tests or work around various limitations in a bid to speed up the integration of multiple  disparate systems  but without proper management  continuous monitoring  and security controls  they have also introduced persistent risks in real world deployments and operations a discussion at an f5 google webinar this year explored the difficulty involved in ascertaining whether performance issues and other disruptions occurring in systems and applications were signs that api sprawl was a contributing factor to cyber attacks  what we do know is that organizations commonly struggle with visibility into the state of api security  security  governance  and efficiency challenges are further compounded by the increased adoption of hybrid cloud infrastructure and microservices  multi cloud complexity and multi app business processes make enforcing consistent security difficult  and vulnerabilities that exist within apis deployed or integrated into larger applications are hard to mitigate and even harder to remediate key ways to manage shadow apis entail api documentation and inventory  api discovery  api validation  and comprehensive visibility into the security of api endpoints api documentation and inventorythe f5 distributed cloud api security solution is built to provide deep insights with the use of artificial intelligence  ai  and machine learning  ml  to identify shadow apis  block api attacks in real time  and eliminate vulnerabilities at their source this requires a solid process for publishing apis with proper documentation which records how the api behaves and how it interacts with other apis  this approach solves the problem of app developers deploying public apis  bypassing internally mandated security processes and procedures  and pushing them into production without proper documentation with f5 distributed cloud web app and api protection  security teams can build a comprehensive inventory of all known apis  their endpoints and expected operations  since apis change frequently  the process runs periodically to ensure that the api inventory is up to date api discovery and validationapi discovery and validation are complemented by two other fundamental elements of api security – authentication and authorization  authentication verifies the identity of users or systems trying to access an api based on username password  api keys  tokens and biometrics  authorization limits the actions an authenticated user or system is allowed to perform within the api through access control rules  roles and permissions the f5 distributed cloud platform automatically discovers api endpoints mapped to applications  blocks unwanted connections and suspicious requests  and monitors for anomalous behavior or shadow apis to prevent data leakage  to prevent injection attacks and other exploits  input validation rules define what is considered valid data  this process ensures that the data received from external sources  such as user inputs or apis  are safe  reliable and free from malicious content comprehensive visibilityin today s dynamic api landscape  maintaining comprehensive visibility into the security posture of api endpoints is paramount all critical app and api security controls necessary to protect an app s entire ecosystem can be deployed and managed through the unified api security console of the f5 distributed cloud platform  this allows devops and secops teams to observe and quickly identify suspected api abuse as anomalies are detected as well as create policies to stop misuse this requires the use of ml models to create baselines of normal api usage patterns  continuous ml based traffic monitoring allows api security to predict and block suspicious activity over time  deviations from these baselines and other anomalies trigger alerts or automated responses to detect outliers  including rogue and shadow apis dashboards play a crucial role in providing the visibility required to monitor and assess the security of apis  the f5 distributed cloud waap platform extends beyond basic api inventory management by presenting essential security information based on actual and attack traffic  specifically  the api endpoints dashboard presents the top attacked apis by percentage of attacks  top sensitive data types found  total api calls broken down by response code  and most active apis critical information – such as discovered sensitive data types  threat levels determined by attack traffic  authentication status  api category and the api s risk score – enables devops and secops teams to quickly identify potential vulnerabilities  prioritize remediation efforts  and make informed decisions to strengthen the security posture of the apis intelligent risk mitigationthe saas based f5 distributed cloud platform enables users to manage and tap on threat analytics  forensics  and troubleshooting of api communications in modern applications ai is used to identify complex attack patterns and zero day vulnerabilities that traditional rule based systems cannot detect  methods such as behavioral analytics to detect suspicious behavior may indicate potential threats from malicious users while risk based controls step up the authentication process  making it more stringent with any increase in perceived threat level the f5 solution scans and tests apis in a runtime environment to uncover vulnerabilities in apis before they are in production  where remediation is more costly and frustrating  it detects and blocks attacks listed in the owasp api top 10 in real time at the development and production layer ultimately the f5 distributed cloud platform is designed to enable unified management of infrastructure and workloads across multiple compute environments for flexible deployment  secure app to app interconnection  and consistent policy enforcement across cloud  data center and edge as well as the application lifecycle this approach to api security heralds something of a shift in the common risk

27,lockbit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children s hospitalit even had the gall to set the ransom demand at  800k … for a nonprofitransomware gang lockbit is claiming responsibility for an attack on a chicago children s hospital in an apparent deviation from its previous policy of not targeting nonprofits stooping to new lows  the criminals are reportedly unwilling to reverse the attack on saint anthony hospital  as they had done in previous cases such as toronto s sickkids hospital what s more  it apparently thinks a nonprofit hospital has the funds to pay a  800 000 ransom  saint anthony hospital has not explicitly stated whether it will or won t pay  but with a sum this large it s highly unlikely that it would ever consider paying  let alone have the funds available to do so the deadline for payment has been set at 01 41 utc on february 2  a  1 000 payment would extend the timer for 24 hours  and  800 000 is the price assigned to the data – that goes for both the destruction of it or the purchase of it by other parties saint anthony hospital confirmed the attack via a statement published this week  saying files containing patient information had been copied by an unknown attacker  the hospital didn t specify the nature of the stolen data but confirmed no medical or financial records were accessed lockbit s intrusion began on december 18 but the hospital s internal investigation didn t conclude patient data was compromised until january 7  in the meantime  it said it took immediate action to secure its network and ensure patient care remained uninterrupted  saint anthony holds cybersecurity and the privacy of patient information in its care as top priorities   it said  pdf    our prompt response to this event allowed us to continue providing patient care without disruption  as part of saint anthony s ongoing commitment to data privacy  we are working to review existing policies and procedures and implement additional ones as needed  saint anthony promptly reported this incident to the fbi and is cooperating with their investigation  we also reported this incident to appropriate regulators  including the us department of health and human services  as the review of the incident progresses  the hospital said it would notify those it believes are impacted by the data theft  until then  all patients are advised to remain vigilant to identity or financial fraud attempts and sign up for a free year of credit monitoring lockbit had in some previous cases shown a degree of restraint when targeting the likes of hospitals and other nonprofits  yet appears to be loosening the shackles on its affiliates  allowing them to target any organization they re able to breach in response to an affiliate that attacked toronto s sickkids hospital last year  lockbit formally apologized  issued a free decryptor  and supposedly booted that affiliate out of its program for violating the rules in a post to its leak blog this week  lockbit said   always us hospitals put their greedy interest over those of their patients and clients  we ve been unable to get in touch with the spokesperson for the gang to ask about the attack and shift in approach  but the malware collectors at vx underground were under the impression that lockbit was either ignorant to the fact saint anthony was a nonprofit  or simply didn t care asked about the reasons for the attack  the gang reportedly responded by sending the hospital s financial disclosures  suggesting it either thought it was indeed a corporate entity or confused the meaning of  nonprofit  for an organization that generates zero revenue   equilend drags systems offline after admitting attacker broke in  subway s data torpedoed by lockbit  ransomware gang claims  freight giant estes refuses to deliver ransom  says personal data opened and stolen  fbi develops decryptor for blackcat ransomware  seizes gang s websitesaint anthony s website clearly states that it s  an independent  nonprofit  faith based  acute care  community hospital   so the decision to press ahead with the attack appears to be nothing more than a senseless money grab  if you attempt to educate

that cybercriminals will always pursue attacks that align with their business goals  although ransomware gangs may have chosen to avoid organizations such as hospitals and not for profits in the past  business is business and criminal goals are no different  the evolution of cybersecurity over the last decade has proved that criminal gangs have also had to pivot in terms of how they attack and financially conquer  ransomware has become a different beast where data has become even more of the focal point in the way it has become a weapon of extortion rather than just relying on an encryption attack followed by ransom demands  no one remains safe from these attacks whether they are targeted or caught up in larger campaigns  companies should never believe they are foolproof due to the

29,how s your vulnerability management program doing  is it effective  a success  let s be honest  without the right metrics or analytics  how can you tell how well you re doing  progressing  or if you re getting roi  if you re not measuring  how do you know it s working and even if you are measuring  faulty reporting or focusing on the wrong metrics can create blind spots and make it harder to communicate any risks to the rest of the business so how do you know what to focus on  cyber hygiene  scan coverage  average time to fix  vulnerability severity  remediation rates  vulnerability exposure… the list is endless  every tool on the market offers different metrics  so it can be hard to know what is important this article will help you identify and define the key metrics that you need to track the state of your vulnerability management program  the progress you ve made  so you can create audit ready reports that   prove your security posture  meet vulnerability remediation slas and benchmarks  help pass audits and compliance  demonstrate roi on security tools  simplify risk analysis  prioritize resource allocationwhy you need to measure vulnerability managementmetrics play a critical role in gauging the effectiveness of your vulnerability and attack surface management  measuring how quickly you find  prioritize and fix flaws means you can continuously monitor and optimize your security with the right analytics  you can see which issues are more critical  prioritize what to fix first  and measure the progress of your efforts  ultimately  the right metrics allow you to make properly informed decisions  so you re allocating the resources to the right places the number of vulnerabilities found is always a good starting point  but it doesn t tell you much in isolation – without prioritization  advisories and progress  where do you start  finding  prioritizing and fixing your most critical vulnerabilities is far more important to your business operations and data security than simply finding every vulnerability intelligent prioritization and filtering out the noise are important because overlooking genuine security threats is all too easy when you re being overwhelmed by non essential information  intelligent results make your job easier by prioritizing issues that have real impact on your security  without burdening you with irrelevant weaknesses for example  your internet facing systems are the easiest targets for hackers  prioritizing issues that leave this exposed makes it easier to minimize your attack surface  tools like intruder make vulnerability management easy even for non experts  by explaining the real risks and providing remediation advice in easy to understand language  but beyond prioritization  what else should or could you be measuring  an example of intruder s vulnerability management report page5 top metrics for every vulnerability management programscan coveragewhat are you tracking and scanning  scan coverage includes all the assets you re covering and analytics of all business critical assets and applications  and the type of authentication offered  e g   username  and password based  or unauthenticated  as your attack surface evolves  changes and grows over time  it s important to monitor any changes to what s covered and your it environment  such as recently opened ports and services  a modern scanner will detect deployments you may not have been aware of and prevent your sensitive data from becoming inadvertently exposed  it should also monitor your cloud systems for changes  discover new assets  and automatically synchronize your ips or hostnames with cloud integrations average time to fixthe time it takes your team to fix your critical vulnerabilities reveals how responsive your team is when reacting to the results of any reported vulnerabilities  this should be consistently low since the security team is accountable for resolving issues and delivering the message and action plans for remediation to management  it should also be based on your pre defined sla  the severity of the vulnerability should have a corresponding relative or an absolute period of time for planning and remediation risk scorethe severity of each issue is automatically calculated by your scanner  usually critical  high or medium  if you decide not to patch a specific or group of vulnerabilities within a specified time period  this is an acceptance of risk  with intruder you can snooze an issue if you re willing to accept the risk and there are mitigating factors for example  when you re preparing for a soc2 or iso audit and you can see a critical risk  you may be willing to accept it because the resource required to fix it isn t justified by the actual level of risk or potential impact on the business  of course  when it comes to reporting  your cto may want to know how many issues are being snoozed and why issuesthis is the point from a vulnerability going public  to having scanned all targets and detecting any issues  essentially  how quickly are vulnerabilities being detected across your attack surface  so you can fix them and reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker what does this mean in practice  if your attack surface is increasing  you may find that it takes you longer to scan everything comprehensively  and your mean time to detect may increase as well  conversely  if your mean time to detect stays flat or goes down  you re using your resources effectively  if you start to see the opposite  you should ask yourself why it s taking longer to detect things  and if the answer is the attack surface has ballooned  maybe you need to invest more in your tooling and security team measuring progressprioritization – or intelligent results – is important to help you decide what to fix first  because of its potential impact on your business  intruder filters out the noise and helps reduce false positives  which is a key metric to track because once you reduce the amount of noise you can circle back and focus on the most important metric – the average time to fix why is this important  because when you do find an issue  you want to be able to fix it as quickly as possible  tools like intruder use multiple scanning engines to interprets the output and prioritize the results according to context  so you can save time and focus on what really matters  when a new vulnerability that could critically affect your systems is identified  intruder will automatically kick off a scanattack surface monitoringthis helps you see the percentage of assets that are protected across your attack surface  discovered or undiscovered  as you team spins up new apps  vulnerability scanner should check when a new service is exposed  so you can prevent data from becoming inadvertently exposed  modern scanners monitor your cloud systems for changes  finding new assets  and synchronizing your ips or hostnames with your integrations why is this important  your attack surface will inevitably evolve over time  from open ports to spinning up new cloud instances  you need to monitor these changes to minimize your exposure  that s where our attack surface discovery comes in  the number of new services discovered during the time period specified helps you understand if your attack surface is growing  whether intentionally or not  why these metrics mattermodern attack surface management tools like intruder measure what matters most  they help provide reports for stakeholders and compliance with vulnerabilities prioritized and integrations with your issue tracking tools  you can see what s vulnerable and get the exact priorities  remedies  insights  and automation you need to manage your cyber risk  if you want to see

material  effect on a company s bottom line  and thus present a risk to shareholders  the lack of transparency by public companies about cyber incidents impacting their operations and data is fueling increasing cyberattacks across all sectors and all industries   the biden omb said in its objection to the senate bill   greater transparency about cyber incidents  as required in the sec s rule  will incentivize corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity and cyber risk management   if the president were presented with s j  res  50  he would veto it   omb said undoing any breach reporting requirement seems antithetical to the work a senator ought to be doing  we asked tillis s office to explain his reasoning  but didn t hear back garbarino  on the other hand  issued a statement in november after submitting his companion resolution in the house that makes his position on the matter clear  breach reporting requirements are the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency s  cisa  job  this cybersecurity disclosure rule is a complete overreach on the part of the sec and one that is in direct conflict with congressional intent   garbarino said in the november release   cisa  as the lead civilian cybersecurity agency  has been tasked with developing and issuing regulations for cyber incident reporting as it relates to covered entities  garbarino said congress and the biden administration are on the same page with regards to harmonizing cybersecurity reporting requirements  though that doesn t appear to be the case based on the omb policy statement   he also said the sec was simply creating duplicative requirements that  further burden an understaffed cybersecurity workforce with additional and unnecessary reporting requirements  part of those concerns may stem from the public nature of sec incident reports  which have to be submitted on sec form 8 k  the contents of which are public  disclosures must include the scope  timing  and nature of the incident  though disclosure may be delayed if the us attorney general determines doing so would pose a risk to national security or public safety tillis  in a brief comment on garbarino s release  only described the sec s reporting rule as commission chair gary gensler doing his best  to hurt market participants by overregulating firms into oblivion   with an onerous rule  that creates unrealistic timelines and unnecessary red tape that will ultimately make markets less safe overall    solarwinds slams sec lawsuit against it as  unprecedented  victim blaming  future of america s cyber safety review board hangs in balance amid calls for rethink  regulator  insurers and customers all coming for progress after moveit breach  us state dept has no idea if its it security actually works  say auditorsit s not clear what the senator and congressman think of the federal trade commission s  ftc  30 day breach reporting requirement passed in october  which isn t mentioned in the earlier statement or resolutions someone has to do somethingdespite garbarino s professed belief that cisa is the one that should be handling breach reporting requirements  the agency has yet to pass any rules that would do so president biden signed the cyber incident reporting for critical infrastructure act  circia  into law in march 2022  but cisa had 24 months from passage  march 2024  to present a rule for consideration  which it has yet to do  when cisa s reporting requirements eventually go into effect  the disclosure window will be even smaller than the sec s  circia asked cisa to give cybersecurity incident victims a mere 72 hours – three days – to report a breach in the meantime  the ftc and sec have taken matters into their own hands  which appears to be helping – we ve even been able to report on breaches at companies like hpe thanks to sec reports as previously reported  the number of victims paying ransomware operators has fallen to 29 percent  the company behind that statistic  ransomware negotiation firm coveware  attributes much of the decrease in ransom payments in recent months to reporting requirements from the sec and ftc those payments are down despite what the white house omb said was a 45 percent increase in ransomware attacks year over year  reversing the sec s rulemaking would not only disadvantage investors … but would also cause companies to undervalue investments in cyber programs to the detriment of our economic and national security   the omb said then again  maybe giving the sec cybersecurity reporting authority isn t the best move – after all  the agency can t even keep its twitter account secure  ®,news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.15628616511821747, 'security updates

41,researchers remotely exploit devices used to manage safe aircraft landings and takeoffsthe closest thing we may ever get to a real life die hard 2 scenariocriminals could remotely tamper with the data that apps used by airplane pilots rely on to inform safe takeoff and landing procedures  according to fresh research in a scenario that elicits strong memories of that nail biting flight scene from die hard 2  researchers investigating electronic flight bags  efbs  found the app used by airbus pilots was vulnerable to remote data manipulation  given the right conditions in reality  that die hard scene was  surprise surprise  riddled with plot holes – the researchers proved that a few months ago – but proving the possibility of something similar would always be exciting an efb is usually a tablet or tablet like portable computer that runs aviation specific apps used for a variety of flight deck or cabin tasks  such as making calculations to improve aircraft performance the vulnerability was found in flysmart  manager  one of many apps within the flysmart  suite used by airbus pilots to synchronize data to other flysmart  apps which provide data to pilots informing safe takeoffs and landings developed by airbus owned navblue  flysmart  manager was found to have disabled app transport security  ats   by setting the nsallowsarbitraryloads property list key to  true   ats is a key security control responsible for securing communications between the app and the app s update server  ats is a security mechanism that forces the application to use https  preventing unencrypted communications   blogged antonio cassidy  partner at pen test partners  who carried out the research   an attacker could use this weakness to intercept and decrypt potentially sensitive information in transit  a feasible attack would have to involve the interception of data flowing to the app  and a number of very specific conditions would need to be met  even ken munro  another partner at pen test partners  admitted exploitation would be unlikely in a real world scenario oh  yes that hotel the airline always uses    first  an attacker would need to be within wi fi range of the efb loaded with flysmart  manager  sounds unlikely  but munro said airlines often use the same hotels to accommodate their pilots between flights  and you can spot them  and the airline they work for  fairly easily secondly  and perhaps the biggest blockade to realistic exploitability  is the fact that an attacker would need to be monitoring the device s traffic at the time of the efb handler initiating an app update the update cycle is determined by the aeronautical information regulation and control  airac  database  the airac database can be updated with important information such as when new runways are installed or made temporarily unavailable  or when significant changes are made to the runway environment  like the installation of a crane when the database is updated with new data  the app must download it to provide pilots with accurate and timely information  this is typically done once a month the attack scenario devised by the researchers involved targeting a pilot sitting at a hotel bar – so  within wi fi range – and performing directional wi fi hunting while targeting a specific endpoint that the attacker would be aware of as they know the target app  given that airlines typically use the same hotel for pilots who are down route   on a layover  an attacker could target the hotel s wi fi networks with the goal of modifying aircraft performance data   said cassidy in developing a proof of concept for an exploit  the researchers were able to access data being downloaded from update servers  most of it came in the form of sqlite databases  with some including weight balance data of an aircraft and the minimum equipment list – information on what systems can be inoperative for a flight cassidy said the possible consequences of a successful exploit could include an airplane tailstrike or a failed takeoff  leading to runway excursions  do i think this is likely  no  absolutely not   said munro   but  the point is there is a vulnerability  there are issues with flight systems and the good news is we re finding them and manufacturers are fixing it    tablet computer zoom error saw plane fly 13 hours with 46cm hole  youtuber who crashed plane for sponsorship dollars earns 6 months behind bars  if anyone finds an  80m f 35 stealth fighter  please call the pentagon  pilots get electronic flight bagairbus was commended by the researchers for fixing the issue within 19 months  which is in the expected range for aviation tech  they said a window of 19 months would be entirely unacceptable in regular it patching  but in aviation  an update like this would typically take around 12 months  so not a million miles away  a longer period of time is required for it to go through certification processes with the aviation industry  we re told munro said   could that be a bit quicker  yeah  i think it could have been a bit quicker  but they fixed it – that s the important thing  and it was done in a reasonable amount of time for aviation software  one active commercial pilot told the register the finding was a  concern   particularly with regard to takeoff performance speeds since the airbus performance program is known for producing different speeds and flap settings to optimize takeoffs  they said because of this frequent change  a pilot probably wouldn t spot a manipulated dataset if it appeared in the efb app  which could lead to dangerous takeoff procedures some airlines have gross error checks that examine the relationship between the calculated speed and actual aircraft speed  based on the aircraft s weight and balance data  the type which was accessed by the researchers while looking into flysmart  manager  i assume  these checks  would pick up a hack… but i couldn t say that categorically   the pilot said responding to the research  an airbus spokesperson said   we identified a potential vulnerability in a specific version of the navblue flysmart  efb product in 2022  our analysis  confirmed by easa  showed that there was no safety issue thanks to the security procedures in place to validate flight relevant data  product improvements have addressed this potential vulnerability in subsequent

is still enough to attract significant interest from fledgling ransomware operations  despite the challenges that remain for newcomers for one thing  there s more and more attention from law enforcement agencies  which shut down numerous operations last year  for example  and this threatens to be a serious deterrent for this year s shenanigans the high degree of competition between gangs was also listed as another reason for some groups dropping off the scene  according to researchers at unit 42 by palo alto networks  cybercriminals must offer competitive payouts to affiliates while also offering a ransomware payload that s effective enough to attract capable criminals to their program and away from powerful competitors like lockbit and alphv blackcat get your hankies ready – some gangs didn t make it   the difficulties facing ransomware groups may explain why so many failed to survive last year  five of the 25 newcomers didn t make it to see their first birthday  failing to register a single attack in the final six months of the year   is critical infrastructure prepared for ot ransomware   akira ransomware gang says it stole passport scans from lush in 110 gb data heist  us readies prison cell for another russian trickbot developer  analysis of leaked conti files blows lid off ransomware gang a lack of leak site posts does not necessarily mean these groups have ceased operations  criminals from these groups could have moved to other types of operations  retreated from public view  or merged with other ransomware groups   blogged doel santos  principal threat researcher at unit 42  if some of these groups did not last the entire year  new threat actors can fill the void  the second half of 2023 revealed posts from 12 new leak sites  indicating these groups might have started later in the year  of the 25 new gangs identified by unit 42  at least 12 of them are connected to pre existing groups either as offshoots or as suspected rebrands of operations that closed down the full list of the new gangs from 2023 is below  including details about whether they are still active and where relevant  what other gang they re supposedly connected to  8base

 ransomed vc rhysida  linked to vice society  threeam trigona  linked to crylock  u bombthe 25 new ransomware operations accounted for roughly a quarter of all publicly claimed ransomware incidents in 2023 we say  publicly claimed  because the number of actual ransomware attacks is likely to be much higher  but due to poor disclosure or paying ransoms early  we ll never get to learn about them out of all the newcomers  akira is thought to be the fastest growing of the bunch and has so far claimed a number of major attacks  such as cosmetics giant lush in just the past few weeks according to blackfog s analysis  pdf  of january 2024 s ransomware incidents  akira laid claim to roughly 12 percent of them  making it the second most active group of the year so far  it s hardly unsurprising if conti is indeed behind the operation – conti at the height of its powers was the most feared group of its time… before it imploded  of course that said  wizard spider  the heavily sanctioned gang behind ryuk  conti  trickbot  and others remains  mostly  at large thanks to russia s blind eye approach to cybercriminals  behavior  as long as all the nastiness is directed to the west 8base is a group that was technically established in 2022  santos said  but given that its leak blog didn t go live until may 2023  it s being lumped together with last year s newbies it started the year strongly  consistently registering more attacks than akira  and although the latter eventually overtook 8base by the end of the year  unit 42 s figures showed very little difference in the final numbers  suggesting it was just as effective as akira the two gangs were the standout  performers  of the 25 new operations last year and  while it wasn t included in unit42 s list  the russian language werewolves group which rapidly rose to prominence towards the very end of the year looks as though it will continue to make a mark this year all groups will also be looking to sweep up the market share left behind by the groups that fell last year  in large part due to the work of international law enforcement agencies hive  ragnar locker  ransomed vc  and trigona were all shuttered by law enforcement last year  and authorities nearly got hold of alphv too but the group managed to wrestle back control during a multi day struggle with the fbi the takedowns were celebrated at the time

45,february 6  2024commentaryone of the most vexing issues in cybersecurity doesn t have to do with technology  it has to do with people  finding enough cybersecurity professionals to fill open positions in the public and private sectors has been a problem for more than a decade  and  despite efforts from both sectors  the situation has not improved  the most recent  2022  report from isc2 puts the us cyber workforce gap at 410 695 — up 9  from the 2021 report  isc2 says the global gap is 3 4 million  noting that the supply of cybersecurity workers cannot keep up with the demand  the global workforce gap increased by over 25  from 2021 to 2022  and nearly 70  of the cyber professionals surveyed for the isc2 report said their organization has a worker shortage one isc2 recommendation for filling the gap is to recruit a more diverse population  as cybersecurity work requires a variety of skills at a variety of levels  and a good portion of the work comes down to problem solving  having a diverse workforce generates different perspectives and ways to solve problems  adding important dimensions to the cyber skill set while many companies are focusing on important diversity  equity  and inclusion  dei  efforts around race and gender  many of the top science  technology  engineering  and math  stem  companies  such as microsoft  sap  and ey  are looking to increase neurodiversity in their workforce  neurodiversity describes the natural variation in human brains that leads to differences in the way we think  learn  and work  while neurodiversity hiring programs originally focused on autism  many employers have expanded their recruitment to include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  adhd   dyslexia  and other  sometimes nonlabeled  differences that bring a new perspective to their workforce neurodiversity as a competitive advantageresearch in psychology and neuroscience points to several assets that neurodivergent people may bring to the workforce  some people with autism excel in detailed pattern recognition and systematic thinking — talents that software companies have leveraged in areas such as quality assurance and debugging  these skills are remarkably well suited for cybersecurity tasks such as monitoring and detecting security breaches adhd and dyslexia are associated with increased idea generation and the ability to see connections between new ideas  in addition  employers have found the nonconformity and innovative thinking that people with adhd or dyslexia bring to the workforce valuable for approaching problems in new and different ways  employers also appreciate the persistence and focus many of their neurodivergent employees demonstrate  which leads to thorough problem solving and follow through  many stem employers say that neurodiversity in their workforce is a competitive advantage how to recruit neurodiverse talentone problem these companies face is not finding enough neurodivergent talent  unfortunately  many of our best learners are discouraged from stem through schooling that focuses on their deficits rather than their talents  many brilliant problem solvers leave school thinking they are intellectually unfit for any professional career  let alone cybersecurity this is why we must start looking at neurodiversity differently in our education systems  we must engage learners in student centered learning  where their own interests and talents guide the learning process  when this happens  each learner can discover their own strengths and work from those  when they feel confident and strong as learners  their deficits can also be addressed  but if we make them feel like losers from the start  we ve given up on them before they can play the game my research shows that companies that have successful neurodiversity workforce programs have changed the way they recruit  interview  hire  and manage their employees placing more emphasis on performance than on communications providing opportunities for employees to work and express themselves in different ways  not always adhering to one cultural norm encouraging managers to foster clear guidelines and expectations  with meeting agendas prepared in advance and meetings documented clearly afterwards  so that nothing gets missed or misinterpreted doing work in teams where each person can work to their strengths  contributing where they are best suited  and relying on others for areas where they struggle not surprisingly  many companies find that the accommodations they make for neurodivergent learners are what all their employees see as good management  everyone benefits from the new ways of working the need for cybersecurity professionals will expand as artificial intelligence  ai  and other new technologies come online  meeting these needs will require an innovative  creative  persistent workforce with a keen eye for detail and systematic thinking  these folks are out there  they are in our classrooms today  educators and cybersecurity companies just need to reach them where they are and give them a chance about the author s you may also likedevsecops  the

53,news  news analysis  and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology managed everything  vendors shift focus to servicesmore companies are opting for managing complex security capabilities  such as data detection and response february 7  2024threat management firm rapid7 and data security firm varonis announced new managed services this week  becoming the latest security companies to bundle complex security capabilities together in managed offerings on feb  6  rapid7 announced its managed digital risk protection  drp  service  which will regularly scan the internet and dark web for signs that attackers may be targeting a client s business  a day earlier  data security firm varonis expanded its portfolio of products that monitor data access and detect potential breaches to offer a managed service to detect and respond to incidents  varonis asserted that the service will focus on detecting potential ransomware and data breaches and responding within 30 minutes  the way a lot of these data breaches actually happen is someone is able to compromise a regular user account  get a lot of data  and then exfiltrate that before anybody finds out   says matthew radolec  vice president of incident response and cloud operations at varonis   our entire value proposition is that we want to help     reduce the amount of data any one person can get to and use detection and response on data to stop those problems  varonis coined a new name for the market segment the new service fits into  managed data detection and response  mddr  understanding new market segmentsorganizations are increasingly consolidating their security vendors — in a september 2022 survey  three quarters of companies said they have pursued vendor consolidation — and that is pushing vendors to differentiate themselves in the market  one way to accomplish that is by creating new market segments  for example  data loss prevention  dlp  as a segment has fragmented into data detection and response  ddr   data security posture management  dspm   and insider risk management  irm   players in this market area include bigid  cyberhaven  dig security  laminar technologies  and sotero nearly every new category leads to a managed version  but one that often does not need to exist and ends up just making the cybersecurity more complex  says jeff pollard  vice president and principal analyst at forrester research  we re creating a scenario for security leaders with all these various drs  detection and response services   where  frankly  they re going to need to buy a tool per dr service   he says   vendors that have a kind of siloed niche offering are trying to make it seem substantially more sophisticated than it is  when in reality what security leaders really need are tools  technologies  and providers that will work across the entirety of their detection surface  making sense of alphabet soupin many ways  managed detection and response  mdr  covers a lot of ground and  so far  has done well for vendors and their customers  vendors have happy clients  exceptionally rapid growth rate  and a very high margin for the service  pollard says  meanwhile  businesses can focus on the threats  leading to faster detection and response  focusing on the data could improve the response time  but that is far from certain however  no matter what telemetry  data  or devices a detection and response service focuses on to detect threats  businesses just want to focus on outcomes — detecting threats and preventing compromises  says eric kokonas  vice president at sophos  the truth is that the best applications of mdr are the result — not of strict adherence to a defined set of tools  telemetry sources  and services — but of an adaptable range of human led capabilities that can be delivered and consumed in ways that are most compatible with organizations  needs and that are most likely to achieve the organizations  desired outcomes   kokonas says   put more plainly  mdr services exist to achieve security and business outcomes the most optimal way possible  companies will likely adopt more managed services because security is growing more complex  offering a managed version of an emerging security service will be an increasingly common approach  as the creation of an in house cybersecurity capability is expensive  analyst firm frost   sullivan stated in its  global managed detection and response market  report published in may 2022  in light of the shortage of cybersecurity professionals  organizations are looking for ways to automate the process of threat detection and response   the report states   the new generation of solutions and services promises to deploy machine learning and artificial intelligence  automating decision making to improve the overall performance of the security stack  data out or cloud invaronis  mddr service aims to help companies track their sensitive data and detect any potential misuse of  or threats to  that data  the service focuses on securing the business from the data outward  at the time of a breach  the most important thing is to identify whether an unauthorized user is accessing data and to block their activity  radolec says  data is this soft and gooey and permeable layer of their security stack  and so we start with security around data  and not just alerting and detection response  but security posture is a big part of what we do   he says   so we help organizations reduce what we call the blast radius  or how much information can any person get to how many resources can a person get to  many other security technologies look to prevent unauthorized users and potential threats from getting into the network and stealing or deleting data — starting with the cloud and moving into securing devices  users and data in the network every company will likely have their own answer to questions about whether to center their security around protecting data  protecting devices  protecting identities  or protecting the cloud first  says forrester s pollard the truth is that no matter the starting point  the goal is the same  he says  the answer is you need a detection and response service that works across the entirety of your detection surface  that includes identities  that includes data  that includes cloud  and that includes applications   he says   it s about avoiding niche offerings that operate in one segment and treating your tech stack like it s a silo  instead of looking at and finding something that is much more holistic and comprehensive

56,cybersecurity insights from industry experts automate routine operational workflows with generative aigenai has the potential to revolutionize how organizations approach enterprise security  compliance  identity  and management processes february 6  2024when you think about your day to day responsibilities across security  compliance  identity  and management  how much of that work follows a repeatable process  how much more efficient could you be if those processes were automated through generative artificial intelligence  genai  genai has the power to greatly streamline operational workflows and democratize knowledge across the entire security team  regardless of experience levels or knowledge about a specific technology or threat vector  rather than having to manually research information on their own  soc analysts can use natural language processing  nlp  embedded within genai models to ask questions and receive answers in a more natural format  nlp also gives genai the flexibility to  understand  what a user is asking and adapt to their style or preferences however  it s important to recognize that genai is not intended to replace human expertise  rather  it should help analysts respond to threats more efficiently by assisting them with guided recommendations and best practices based on the organization s own security data  known threat intelligence  and existing processes  here s how establish trust through transparencybefore a security  compliance  identity  or management workflow can be automated  teams first need to be confident that all of the information at their disposal is complete and accurate  routine back end work is an ideal candidate for automation because it is both predictable and easily verified  rather than having analysts spend their time responding to simple help desk tickets or writing incident reports  why not leverage nlp and genai to automate those tasks  this way analysts can dedicate their time to more business critical work for this to work effectively  genai models must be transparent  analysts should be able to understand the sources that the ai model pulled from and easily validate that information to ensure the ai is providing accurate recommendations at microsoft  we ve defined  published  and implemented ethical principles to guide our ai work  and we ve built out constantly improving engineering and governance systems to put these principles into practice  transparency is one of the foundational principles of our responsible ai framework  alongside fairness  reliability and safety  privacy and security  inclusiveness  and accountability how to deploy genai in your environmenta number of repeatable  multistep processes across security  compliance  identity  and management are primed for automation for example  when investigating incidents  analysts often have to examine scripts  command line arguments  or suspicious files that may have been executed on an endpoint  rather than manually researching this information  analysts can simply provide the script they observed and ask the ai model to break it down using a collection of prompts put together to accomplish specific security related tasks  each prompt book requires a specific input — for example  a code snippet or a threat actor name the script is then explained step by step and the ai model is consulted to provide input as to whether the script may be malicious  from there  if any network indicator is present  it s correlated against threat intelligence and relevant results are summarized before being included  the ai can also provide recommendations based on the script actions and generate a report that summarizes the session for nontechnical audiences using ai this way provides two core benefits  first  the ai can automatically upskill users who may not understand the complexities of analyzing a script or file using a very transparent  repeatable process  second  it saves time by having the model assist with common follow up actions  such as correlating any indicators to threat intelligence and writing a summary report another genai use case is device management and compliance through conditional access policies  if devices don t meet specific policies  they are restricted from accessing company resources  this can lead to machines being locked out and users filing internal tickets to resolve the issue  in this scenario  it operations or help desk support staff can leverage nlp prompts to input the unique device identifier and quickly understand the compliance status of the device  the ai can then use nlp to explain why the device is noncompliant and provide step by step instructions on how to resolve the issue in the appropriate tool  this is powerful because someone without direct experience in a particular tool can now perform the task  avoiding the need to escalate ultimately  genai has the potential to completely revolutionize the way we approach enterprise security  compliance  identity  and management processes  by extending our thinking on how to apply genai in operational roles  we can save practitioners time  equip them with new skills  and ensure their time is spent on what matters most — read more partner perspectives from microsoft securityread more about partner perspectivesabout the author s you may also

transport security  ats  feature in flysmart  manager that would have forced the app to use https had not been enabled  the app did not have any form of certificate validation either  leaving it exposed to interception on open and untrusted networks   an attacker could use this weakness to intercept and decrypt potentially sensitive information in transit   ptp said in its report this week ken munro  a partner at the pen testing firm  says the biggest concern had to do with the potential for attacks on the app that could cause so called runway excursions — or veer offs and overruns — and potential tail strikes on takeoff   the efb is used to calculate the required power from the engines for departure  also the required braking on landing   munro says   we showed that  as a result of the missing ats setting  one could potentially tamper with the data that is then given to pilots  that data is used during these  performance  calculations  so pilots could apply insufficient power or not enough braking action   he says the ats issue in flysmart  manager is just one of several vulnerabilities that ptp has uncovered in efbs in recent years  in may 2023  for instance  the firm reported an integrity check bypass flaw in a lufthansa efb app called lido eroutemanual that gave attackers a way to modify flight planning data that pilots using the app received  in july 2022  researchers at ptp showed how they could modify manuals on an efb pertaining to the effectiveness of de icing procedures on aircraft wings hard to exploitfrom a practical standpoint the disabled ats setting issue that ptp identified in the airbus efb was not especially easy to exploit  to pull it off  an attacker would have first needed to be within wi fi range of an efb with the vulnerable app  more significantly  the attack would have been possible only during an app update — meaning the threat actor would need to know when the update was happening so they could insert their malicious code during the process according to ptp  those conditions can occur during pilot layovers   airline efbs can be exposed to interception on untrusted networks given pilot layover hotels are well known and used consistently each night   the firm said pilots usually bring their efbs with them during layovers because the devices contain their electronic roster as well  munro says  so  if an attacker was within wi fi range of the device at a hotel they could potentially initiate an attack   missing ats would allow a man in the middle attack over wi fi  at which point the attacker could push a tampered database update to the efb   he says while an attack can only happen during an app update  such updates need to happen on a regular basis  he adds  that improves the odds for a successful attack  munro notes   a quirk of the aviation industry means that the software must be updated once every 30 days to remain legal   he says   given airport layover hotels are known and numerous pilots will be staying at each one every night  the odds and practicality start to add up  about the author s you may also likedevsecops  the smart way to shift leftfeb 14  2024making sense of security operations

61,half of polled infosec pros say their degree was less than useful for real world workthe other half paid attention in class half of infosec professionals polled by kaspersky said any cybersecurity knowledge they picked up from their higher education is at best somewhat useful for doing their day jobs  on the other hand  half said the know how was at least very useful  we re a glass half empty lot the moscow headquartered multinational revealed those figures today in the first part of a multi stage report based on a survey of 1 012 infosec professionals across 29 countries about a quarter of those probed said their higher education was  not at all useful  for their working life in cybersecurity  12 percent said it was  slightly useful   and 14 percent described it as  somewhat useful   adding up to 50 percent for the negatives  on the flip side  29 percent said their education was  extremely  useful  and 21 percent said  very  useful here s what kaspersky had to say about that the lack of teaching personnel with real world experience in the cybersecurity might be one of the biggest reasons explaining traditional education’s detachment from the industry and respondents hesitating to call their formal studies useful or it might be that they took the wrong course  or didn t pay attention  but that s just our opinion  and we should include this part from kaspersky s report to give you more context of the infosec professionals with two to five years’ experience  just 19 percent feel their formal education was extremely useful or very useful in their day to day work  while three quarters of these young professionals say the theoretical knowledge they got was not useful in helping them fulfil their responsibilities  however  this trend is skewed towards mid and senior level professionals if you were wondering what subjects these industry professionals studied – for instance  it s no surprise that someone taking physics found that less than useful for it security – we pondered that  too  kaspersky said 36 percent of those polled said the highest level of education they got was in engineering  21 percent said information technology  15 percent said computer science  13 percent said business management  10 percent said science  and three percent said mathematics or something else we re told 43 percent of the polled cybersecurity professionals

already outdated in your third or fourth years of study  as mentioned above  an overall skills gap in the it security industry may have caused or is fueling a shortage of qualified instructors who have practical industry experience as opposed to theoretical knowledge  without those educators  graduates may feel the knowledge they gained is less than useful in the real world almost 40 percent of the polled infosec professionals worldwide said they  somewhat disagree    disagree   or  strongly disagree  that their college or university professors had real world experience  breaking that down

disagreed their tutors had outside experience  and the middle east  turkey and africa  48 percent  latin america seemed to have the highest report with only 20 percent of people surveyed disagreeing that their professors had practical experience in the field overall  half of the respondents rated the availability of infosec courses in higher education institutions as poor  27 percent  or very poor  23 percent   and this number jumped to 83 percent for professionals with between two and five work experience under their belt according to one professional from the us   there was no such thing

63,the spyware business is booming despite government crackdowns almost zero data being shared across the industry on this particular threat   we re toldupdated the commercial spyware economy – despite government and big tech s efforts to crack down – appears to be booming in addition to the major players like pegasus developer nso group  and predator maker intellexa  google’s threat analysis group  tag  has found  dozens of smaller  commercial surveillance vendors and tracks around 40 such organizations other exploitation supply chain orgs also make money from these nefarious tools – from the initial exploit developers and suppliers on through to the spyware vendors that charge varying amounts depending on what capabilities the customer requests in 2023  tag reports it uncovered 25 zero days under active exploitation  and 20 of these were abused by commercial surveillance vendors  all these players enable the proliferation of dangerous tools and capabilities used by governments against individuals  which threatens the safety of the internet ecosystem and the trust on which a vibrant and inclusive digital society depends   according to a tag report published on tuesday the safety of the internet is not the only thing at stake as a result of spyware vendors’ efforts  the report shares stories of victims such as human rights advocates and journalists whose devices were infected with pegasus these tools have also been used to secure the detention of political dissidents  lawyers  journalists and activists  some deployments of spyware have been blamed for victims’ deaths  this  despite assurances from some of the surveillance vendors that their products can only be sold to governments and used to fight terrorism and other serious crimes  i have yet to see any reporting on legitimate use of this software   cisco talos head of outreach nick biasini lamented in an interview with the register  that s not to say that it doesn t exist   he added   it could be used in highly classified environments so that information never sees the light of day  but the majority of the activity seems to be around dissidents  activists  reporters  lawyers and those types of victims  which implies a non standard application of the technology  government to the rescue western governments are taking steps to curb this  12 billion a year industry  on monday  the us announced it would impose visa restrictions on anyone involved in the abuse of commercial spyware  presumably  this extends from the makers and suppliers all the way to end users that action follows last year s executive order banning the us government s use of commercial spyware that presents a national security risk to america – although  as the register pointed out at the time  the order includes big loopholes for uncle sam s snoops and american made products on tuesday  a group of 35 nations  led by the uk and france  signed an agreement to  tackle proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber intrusion tools and services   tech giants including apple  google and microsoft also reportedly participated  but declined to comment despite these and other efforts  the spyware business  appears to be booming   biasini observed   there s a lot of growth  if you look at the offensive conferences – especially the ones in europe that have been going on – there are just a deluge of vendors that sit in this space  the spyware economyone of the  bigger trends  that talos is tracking within the spyware economy is the  decoupling between the commercial spyware vendors and the vulnerability and exploit vendors   biasini added according to tag  spyware users typically use exploit chains  rather than a single point of entry  to remotely drop spyware to the target s devices  this usually includes three or four zero days  the report indicates  the findings don t include any pricing info for these zero days – which tend to allow remote code execution  sandbox escape and local privilege escalation the tag report does include some details on spyware vendors  pricing models – but nothing new one is a widely sourced 2021 new york times publication of a pitch document for predator  the base price of €8 million   8 6 million  buys the user a remote  one click exploit chain to install spyware implants on android and ios devices and the ability to run ten concurrent implants  intellexa provides project management  and a 12 month warranty on the contract the second is an offer for nova – an intellexa alliance combined spyware and data analysis system that was leaked on the xss is cybercrime forum in 2022  in addition to the base price  users can buy persistence on victim devices for an extra €3 million   3 2 million   and an additional five country package for another €1 2 million   1 3 million    us judge rejects spyware slinger nso s attempt to bin apple lawsuit  kaspersky reveals previously unknown hardware  feature  exploited in iphone attacks  think tank report labels nso  lazarus as  cyber mercenaries   us commerce dept pinky swears it won t push american spyware on world plus dogwhen asked about these pricing models  and what talos has seen  biasini explained the nyt story and the xxs leak are the only two data points he s aware of   we are basically operating on two leaked pieces of data   he noted   that s all we have  this illustrates another part of the problem  the spyware economy remains mysterious  there is almost zero data being shared across the industry on this particular threat  and that is a massive problem   biasini worried   if we really want to fix this  we need more eyes on this – not less  as someone who operates in the tech space  it is a herculean effort for us to get samples to be able to analyze  and that should not be the case  in addition to samples of the malware itself  investigators need indicators of compromise  and hashes – things that are lacking in spyware reports  similarly  none of the sources the register contacted for this story could  or would  provide us with any other examples of or information about spyware pricing models all of this contributes to a lack of visibility  which allows the miscreants abusing surveillance tools to operate with impunity while their victims live in fear  ®updated to add the recent uk pall mall process highlights a growing international alarm over the global spyware crisis   elina castillo jiménez  advocacy coordinator at the security lab at amnesty tech told the register  while a positive step  the declaration is far short of what is needed to rein in the commercial surveillance industry  states must adopt a ban on highly intrusive spyware altogether and establish robust safeguards for any permissible use of other forms of spyware  international law already defines legitimate spyware applications narrowly  instead of debating this  the focus must shift to protecting individuals from unlawful surveillance  furthermore – there is a lot that can be done by governments individually – including through ceasing to purchase products from commercial surveillance vendors  enforcing export regulations  and providing accountability for already documented victims of spyware  ,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.13397859036922455, 'security

typhoon advanced persistent threat  apt  is consistently targeting highly sensitive critical infrastructure  with new information on the cyberattackers  pivot to operational technology  ot  networks once they ve burrowed inside given that the ot network is responsible for the physical functions of industrial control systems  ics  and supervisory control and data acquisition  scada  equipment  the findings clearly corroborate the ongoing suspicion that chinese hackers are looking to be able to disrupt critical physical operations in energy  water utilities  communications  and transportation  presumably to cause panic and discord in the event of a kinetic conflagration between the us and china  volt typhoon actors are pre positioning themselves on it networks to enable lateral movement to ot assets to disrupt functions   according to cisa s volt typhoon advisory   we   are concerned about the potential for these actors to use their network access for disruptive effects in the event of potential geopolitical tensions and or military conflicts  it s an important set of revelations  according to john hultquist  chief analyst at mandiant intelligence google cloud  previously  we could deduce from targeting that the actor had a strong interest in critical infrastructure that had little intelligence value   he said in an emailed analysis  but the cisa report shows that  volt typhoon is gathering information on  and even penetrating  ot systems — the highly sensitive systems that run the physical processes at the heart of critical infrastructure   he added   under the right conditions  ot systems could be manipulated to cause major shutdowns of essential services  or even to create dangerous conditions  hultquist added   if there was any skepticism as to why this actor is carrying out these intrusions  this revelation should put it to rest  living off the land   hiding for 5 yearscisa also revealed today that volt typhoon  aka vanguard panda  bronze silhouette  dev

relies on valid accounts and leverage s  strong operational security  which     allows for long term undiscovered persistence   cisa explained   volt typhoon actors conduct extensive pre exploitation reconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment  tailor their tactics  techniques  and procedures  ttps  to the victim s environment  and dedicate ongoing resources to maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time  even after initial compromise  while volt typhoon s strategy of staying hidden by using legitimate utilities and blending in with normal traffic isn t a new phenomenon in cybercrime  it does make it difficult for potential targets to actively scan for malicious activity  according to cisa  which issued extensive lotl guidance today for doing just that meanwhile  an infrastructure update  while it could in some cases require a costly and labor intensive forklift replacement  might not go awry either  many of the ot environments being targeted are notorious for running outdated software  either out of negligence or necessity  if the systems cannot be updated  which increases the risk posed by this threat   westin said worryingly  cisa also noted that the danger extends beyond the us  last month  securityscorecard s strike team identified new infrastructure linked to volt typhoon that indicated the apt was also

65,cybersecurity in depth  feature articles on security strategy  latest trends  and people to know as smart cities expand  so do the threatsthe systems that make up a smart city ecosystem are not easily secured and require better design and better policy to ensure they are not vulnerable february 6  2024for technologists  building smart cities is not an aspirational goal but a matter of necessity  the world bank estimates that 70  of the world s population will be living in urban areas by 2050  up from 56  today  this massive population shift will place increasing pressure on city infrastructure and technology used to manage urban areas  increased automation will also bring new threats while the concept of a smart city may seem monolithic  in reality it is a collection of independent technologies and systems communicating with each other and a central management hub  creating a diverse ecosystem of technologies — one that needs to be well secured  says piyush pandey  the us cyber data market leader at business consultancy deloitte  in many cases  those technologies have not been adequately secured individually  let alone as an interdependent ecosystem exposed to the public  he says  this is obviously not just one system that needs to be secure      with this smart ecosystem and the massive number of interconnections  we are consciously allowing our network to be exposed   pandey says   the security is not really limited to applying some sort of a firewall or physical security at the device level  we have to look at this in a holistic fashion  a number of countries are pursuing the concept of smart cities  from governments in the middle east and africa to singapore s claim as the smartest city in the world  a city can collect more than 500 million events per day from its diverse array of systems — smart electric meters  street lights  transportation monitors  and emergency management systems — according to a recent deloitte report on securing smart ecosystems  while the convergence of information technology  it   operational technology  ot   the internet of things  iot   and automation will lead to increased efficiency  the smarts of a smart city will also result in a greater vulnerability to threats ransomware has become a major issue for local governments  and the increasing automation of cities adds to the operational challenges  with concerns that ransomware could shut down civic operations a trio of risk driversfrom intelligent transportation systems  to smart electrical grids  to just in time critical infrastructure  smart city systems link a vast pool of devices — many with no built in security features of their own — to untrusted systems  such as smartphones  legacy technologies  and desktops running out of date software  the three most vulnerable and impactful systems are those used for emergency alerts  street video surveillance  and smart traffic lights  according to a 2020 survey of smart city security experts conducted by uc berkeley s center for long term cybersecurity  cltc  many of those systems were put in place without much consideration for cybersecurity  says rowland herbert faulkner  graduate researcher in city and regional planning affiliated with cltc  we don t have built in product security for a lot of things  and if we don t put that in place  then we are still broadening the threat landscape  the risks go up exponentially   he says   that s something that s come up in research for quite a while  how do we deal with product security  especially when we re dealing with these interconnected systems  especially when someone s device can be used as an attack vector or as an entry point into the system  three main factors — convergence  interoperability  and integration — drive risks in smart city ecosystems  according to deloitte s report  the marriage of cyber and physical systems — convergence — allows one domain to affect the other  dramatically increasing the attack surface  devices from different systems — some old  and some new — interoperate with one another  putting old systems that were never intended to be connected at risk  finally  the tight integration of devices across systems means that an attack can quickly impact other systems  creating a cascading of impacts  not only are the boundaries blurred because there are no organizational boundaries in a smart ecosystem  there are no system boundaries because now we are talking about the cyber and physical convergence   says deloitte s pandey   we have multiple different vendors coming into play with different devices and disparate systems that have varying degrees of security controls  so now when they are interconnected  the weakest system  becomes  the problem  smart device security  a 20 year problemthe different systems vary by purpose — smart license plate readers have a different architecture than the smart electrical grid — and also by protocols  while they are likely to communicate over wireless technologies  they also are likely to talk to each other through centralized hubs  most devices cannot run security agents because such add on security would cause too great of a performance hit for many programmable logic controllers  iot devices  and other low power hardware  says tom pace  ceo of xiot security firm netrise  it ll probably get there  but that

69,news  news analysis  and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology microsoft adds face check to entra verified idmicrosoft has released the public preview of face check  which detects a person s  liveness  and compares their appearance against existing documents  such as a driver’s license  to verify identity february 7  2024microsoft has added facial matching to its entra verified id service  which lets organizations create and issue verifiable credentials to validate claims  such as employment  education  certifications  and residence  the new face check feature is available as a free public preview release  with a yet unpriced commercial release slated for later this year face check uses microsoft s azure ai face api to match a person s real time selfie — confirmed to be authentic via  liveness detection  — captured by the microsoft authenticator app with an existing trusted identity document  such as an employment id  driver s license  or passport  microsoft authenticator s verified id feature generates a confidence score and sends it to the party who requested a face check early preview customers are using face check with verified id to reduce the risks of account takeover and impersonation for employees  vendors  and business guests  help desk and cybersecurity operations provider bemo  an early face check tester  used the feature to verify the identity of an employee issuing a request  according to microsoft  face check using entra verified id is a new verification capability that can be used to verify the person authenticating is indeed the rightful owner of authentication credentials  such as passkeys  or fido2  mfa  or even username and password   says ankur patel  microsoft s head of product for entra verified id  the company says face check is more reliable than self attestation for accessing sensitive data or authentication to create new accounts extending microsoft entra id with verified idverified id was built with a standards based interop profile in partnership with ibm  workday  ping  and mattr  so anyone can build compatible digital wallets   patel notes  originally described by patel as a standards based decentralized identity  did  system  verified id is intended to address the limitations of microsoft entra id services  formerly azure ad  by enabling the use of credentials beyond the organization gartner forecasts that integration with identity verification  idv  and access management platforms will become standard by 2027 for onboarding  credentialing  and recovery  further  idv could reduce account takeover attacks by 75   according to gartner  all access management  am  vendors  including microsoft and its direct competitors  offer the support to integrate with third party idv tools   says gartner senior research director henrique teixeira   however  only a minority offer their own idv solution and even fewer are combining it with a biometric authentication solution out of the box  facial recognition raises privacy concernswhile microsoft promises a more user friendly and secure approach to digital idv with face check and verified id  critics of facial recognition have long decried the potential for misusing the technology  microsoft s patel describes face check as  a privacy respecting facial matching feature for high assurance verifications   noting that privacy concerns were taken into account for one  the company emphasized that neither microsoft authenticator  verified id  nor the azure ai services store or retain any of the data or images   when using face check   there s a 91  chance that it s me and not somebody else  so even if you got ahold of my phone  you couldn t use it   patel says  statistically  he adds  there is a one in a billion chance that a match could be an impersonation attack within a five minute time window will 91  be reliable enough to satisfy concerns by enterprises providing access to sensitive data  organizations can decide whether the risk is appropriate for specific types of business decisions and configure the acceptance score accordingly  according to patel gartner s teixeira predicts that preventing risks of attacks overshadows privacy issues  i believe that the additional benefits of such solutions in reducing the probability of a breach will outweigh the privacy concerns associated with the technology   he says the addition of face check to verified id aims to boost confidence in the credentials that users present  patel says that microsoft will soon reveal plans to extend its face api pattern to verify a broader array of identity attributes  such as verified work history and legal entity verification  through partnerships with dun   bradstreet  dnb  and lexisnexis lots of interest in facial recognitiondespite calls for regulation  facial recognition is one of the more popular forms of authentication  when the biometrics institute asked which form of biometrics organizations are likely to implement for its 2023 industry survey  45  of respondents said they planned to increase their use of facial recognition  coming in second was multimodal biometrics at 16   followed by voice at 9   iris at 7   and behavioral at 6   the microsoft approach is highly valuable for a broader scale of adoption of verified identities and is expected to benefit the entire industry   says kuppingercole analysts founder and principal analyst martin kuppinger   this will help in achieving critical mass  nevertheless  mass adoption won t happen in the short term  kuppinger adds  challenges may arise regarding regulatory requirements for certain scenarios  but  basically  the approach helps in strengthening the cybersecurity posture and  ensures  privacy issues are addressed in a well thought out manner  avoiding sharing or centrally storing biometric information   he says cost will also be a factor  organizations surely will be keen to understanding the yet to be announced licensing model before making strategic decisions   kuppinger says about the author s you may also likedevsecops  the smart way to shift leftfeb 14  2024making sense of security operations

a comprehensive ot security strategy that includes measures such as threat intelligence  technological measures  incident response plans  and training of employees related to the regulation of the incd  israel national cyber directorate  from a human point of view  the treatment of ot threats requires extended specialization not only from cybersecurity but a deep familiarity with the worlds of ot and their communication protocols  for this purpose  we require skilled manpower who sits in the control centers with eyes and hands right on the keyboard upon receiving a suspicion of an incident  from a technological point of view  we provide protection at all network layers  physical separation between networks  work environments and microsegmentation  identity management with advanced tools using pam   and  establishing a laboratory that simulates the operational activity and adjusting the changes on the system before downloading for execution dr  can cyberattacks against ot be thoroughly defended against shaked kafzan  from the perspective of a cybersecurity company  the surge in attacks against ot systems is worrying but expected  what s more worrying is how poorly prepared the critical infrastructure sector is against attacks with potentially fatal or incredibly costly consequences  when the stakes are so high  when the costs are so severe  there is no room for risk  cybersecurity must be implemented as a means to prevent  not to  fix  dr  what is different about rail security from a protection perspective kafzan  cybersecurity for rail and ot must be proactive and continuous  to do this  organizations must implement network segmentation on real network traffic  have strict authentication and access controls  ensure continuous monitoring and detection of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations  and stay updated on what is going on in the space  including keeping up with cybersecurity compliance standards dr  of course  a reliable patching process and vulnerability management best practices are key to a security strategy  but for an ot organization  what are the issues with patching while keeping systems online kafzan  patching a cybersecurity vulnerability within a rail network is like changing the wheels of a car while it s moving  it s not simple  and  many times  it s not doable  though we are a cybersecurity provider  our security strategy has to bear in mind the interests of our rail customers  which are high availability and physical safety this means we must rely on passive yet deeply informative and rail operational contextual solutions that will mitigate a cybersecurity incident and fortify the organization s cybersecurity posture without any interference in its existing infrastructure and systems dr  each system comes with its own challenges  so what steps do you take when patching goan  since business continuity is must  we examine any implementation or change in general — meaning that first we consider whether the systems support live or hot patching  then we will verify if downtime is required  and what is it  the downtime   and finally     we will consider the risk of the repair versus leaving the weak point in the background of these things  we strengthen our operating concept through a strong and updated laboratory environment for the operational environment that supports many tests of the changes that we want to implement alongside a robust system of backups and procedures that allow us to go back to any point in time before the change was made dr  as a possible protection option  we ve seen ai cited as a key trend for cybersecurity in 2024  in particular in the field of industrial automation  does this change the way you work  and ot can be better secured goan  along with the many threats that ai poses to us  we receive inherent advantages in the technological tools we have chosen that combine ai capabilities in a fast  efficient  and automatic manner as we move forward  i predict that the ai capabilities will be able to perform a large number of high quality and good actions for our systems  but we must remember that in the end there will be hands on the keyboard and a high quality human response that will be able to prioritize the events dr  from your position providing security for rail operators  how does ai fit into what you provide kafzan  behind the scenes  ai is more than just a trend  it is an exciting opportunity to more effectively enhance the security of rail systems  it allows us to analyze vast amounts of data while staying continuously updated with the global cybersecurity community s knowledge  in order to quickly identify  respond  and remediate threats in real time ai will allow us to predict potential security breaches before they happen  based on patterns it has learned  an immediate benefit of the technologies is its ability to improve operational efficiency  optimize schedules and routes  and enhance passenger experience by providing real time insights  it can help minimize downtime and extend the lifespan of the existing infrastructure by offering predictions of when parts of the train systems or

72,iran s cyber operations in israel a potential prelude to us election interferencetactics are more sophisticated and supported in greater numbersiran s anti israel cyber operations are providing a window into the techniques the country may deploy in the run up to the 2024 us presidential elections  microsoft says an analysis of iran s activity  published by microsoft threat analysis center  mtac  today  concluded that iran may again target us elections as it did in 2020  using more sophisticated techniques from a wealth of different groups the main fear for us elections comes from the growing number of pro iran and iran linked groups carrying out cyberattacks and influence operations since the conflict between israel and hamas broke out in october 2023  defenders can no longer take solace in tracking a few groups   mtac s report reads   rather  a growing number of access agents  influence groups  and cyber actors makes for a more complex and intertwined threat environment  based on microsoft s threat intelligence data  the us and israel have consistently been the prime targets for iran linked cyberattacks  and the increasing effectiveness and brazenness of those efforts may be a cause for concern as november s election edges closer iran s influence operations  for example  pushing anti israel propaganda  were shown to be highly effective at reaching western audiences – a tactic that could feasibly be transposed to the us election too in the first week of the war between israel and hamas  microsoft spotted a 42 percent spike in traffic to news sites run by or affiliated with the iranian state that surge was especially apparent in english speaking countries such as the us  uk  canada  australia  and new zealand  and even though this traffic trailed off after the first week of the war  for three weeks after it remained 28 percent above pre war levels these influence operations are well documented already and were spotted early in the conflict  but the effectiveness of the campaigns to reach western audiences  combined with the increasing number of groups willing to engage in these missions  is a concern iran is known for historically taking advantage of channels such as social media for these operations  but for the first time ai played a role  microsoft said  it pointed to a december hijacking of a streaming tv channel to broadcast fake news reports  presented by an ai generated human newsreader that reached audiences in the uk  canada  and the united arab emirates  this marked the first iranian influence operation microsoft has detected where ai played a key component in its messaging and is one example of the fast and significant expansion in the scope of iranian operations since the start of the israel hamas conflict  as for how iran might wish to act in the months leading up to november s presidential election  we can look back to 2020 for clues according to a report  pdf  from the us director of national intelligence  dni   the country s main aim was to undermine the reelection prospects of president trump the pro iran players at work here didn t attempt to jeopardize trump s campaign through the promotion of his rivals  but instead by sowing division and exacerbating social tensions among us citizens  there was no evidence to suggest that the election itself or its voting systems were tampered with by iran s campaign  we have high confidence in this assessment   the report reads   we assess that supreme leader khamenei authorized the campaign and iran s military and intelligence services implemented it using overt and covert messaging and cyber operations  in response  the us indicted two iranians who both have  10 million bounties on their heads  per the rewards for justice program  available to anyone with information leading to their location seyyed mohammad hosein musa kazemi and sajjad kashian  aged 24 and 27 respectively  are alleged to have stolen us voter data and used it to send threatening emails in a bid to intimidate voters  among a sprawling list of allegations  they also are said to have breached a us media company s network and would have succeeded in publishing false narratives if the fbi hadn t caught them and alerted the company beforehand   uncle sam wants to make it clear that america s elections are very  very safe  iranian cyberspies target us defense orgs with a brand new backdoor  hacktivists boast  we shut down iran s gas pumps today  us warns iranian terrorist crew broke into  multiple  us water facilitiesiran s influence efforts are essentially categorized by the us as those that seek to undermine the legitimacy of its elections and institutions more so than any single candidate  for example  the emails sent to us voters  like those by the two indicted individuals  were mainly designed to spread uncertainty around voter fraud  we assess that tehran s efforts to attempt to influence the outcome of the 2020 us election and iranian officials  preference that former president trump not be reelected were driven in part by a perception that the regime faced acute threats from the us   the dni report reads microsoft believes that all three of the prime suspects for election interference – iran  russia  and china – will spin up their respective campaigns in the run up to this year s election  despite taking a backseat during the 2022 midterms it may be the first time a us election faces simultaneous interference attempts from multiple authoritarian states  it said iran s cyber capabilityin addition to iran s methods for conducting influence operations  including the abuse of social media platforms and pushing news content that s seemingly legitimate  iran has also demonstrated its significant cyber capability in recent attacks in israel to support its campaign in addition to pushing the boundaries  poking the us to see what it can get away with  as it has done recently with the attack on its water systems late last year  iran has engaged in destructive cyber operations akin to those used in the russia ukraine conflict for example  in addition to taking an israel made programmable logic controller offline at a pennsylvania water authority in november  displaying an anti israel message on the screen  tehran linked groups such as shahid kaveh used ransomware against israeli cctv cameras this took place in october  roughly two weeks into the war  and shahid kaveh used one of its personas to claim it breached the cctv of the nevatim air force base  when in fact it only popped the cameras on a civilian street in nevatim  not the military base in the same area as the conflict raged on  iran s destructive cyber attacks began to grow in scope  including targets such as bahrain and albania – both of which have relatively friendly relations with israel albania was the target of attacks from the homeland justice group  part of iran s ministry of intelligence and security  mois   homeland justice warned of impending attacks in november which eventually came on christmas day government systems were downed by the attacks  while a national airline and telco were also targeted at the same time bahrain  on the other hand  was targeted by al toufan  government and financial organizations bore most of the brunt  which is thought to be in large part due to the 2020 signing of the bahrain–israel normalization agreement from the early days of the conflict  the number of pro iran groups carrying out cyber operations grew quickly beyond the nine microsoft initially tracked to 14 by the two week mark  this then led to greater collaboration among these groups  including between mois group pink sandstorm and the lebanon based  pro iran hezbollah group  collaboration lowers the barrier to entry  allowing each group to contribute existing capabilities and removes the need for a single group to develop a full spectrum of tooling or tradecraft   said clint watts  general manager at mtac and author of its latest report  iranian focus on israel has intensified  while israel and the us have always been tehran s main targets  the outbreak of the israel hamas war saw 43 percent of iranian nation state cyber activity focused on israel  more than the next 14 targeted countries combined   ®,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack

2024 0244   they affect different processes common across canon s product lines – the username or password process involved with authenticating mobile devices  for example  the service location protocol  slp  attribute request process  and more the company assigned them all  critical  9 8 out of 10 ratings on the common vulnerability scoring system  cvss  scale  as explained in a security advisory  they can allow unauthenticated attackers to remotely perform denial of service  dos  or arbitrary code execution against any affected printers connected directly to the internet  they also offer a handy pivot point to burrow deeper into victim networks no exploitations have been observed in the wild as of yet  according to the company s european site  but owners should scan for indicators of compromise given that the bugs have been publicly known but unpatched for months hard to handle  the problem with printer securitythe seven vulnerabilities patched on feb  5 were revealed alongside dozens of others at pwn2own toronto s soho smashup last summer  where contestants were invited to breach routers and then the small office home office  soho  devices they connect to printers  so rarely recognized as fertile grounds for cyberattacks  were given their own category at the event  it s a pretty large attack surface right now that s often overlooked  especially in small businesses  because it s hard to manage from an enterprise level   explains dustin childs  head of threat awareness for trend micro s zero day initiative  zdi   which runs the pwn2own hacking contest   i mean  it s not like printers have automatic updates or other features that you can use to manage them cleanly and easily  he adds   printers have always been kind of notorious for being finicky  you can go back to office space — one of the big scenes where they took a baseball bat to the printer  it s a joke  but it s a joke that s based in reality  these things are difficult to manage  the drivers are difficult to manage  and there s a lot of problematic software on them  as a result  an old office printer — connected to other  more sensitive devices in a small or midsized business  smb  network — tends to be rather trivial to crack  i was a little shocked with how little they had to work on it to find really workable exploits   childs recalls of pwn2own toronto  as a case in point   last year somebody played the mario theme on a printer  and he said it took him longer to figure out how to play the mario theme than to exploit the printer  what smbs can do about printer security chaosbeyond the obvious step of updating to the latest firmware  canon is advising its customers to  set a private ip address for the products and create a network environment with a firewall or wired wi fi router that can restrict network access  the advice speaks to a larger point  that even if printers are thick and unwieldy  what s manageable is their connectivity  it used to be that there were  believe it or not  internet addressable printers  what businesses have done is they ve gotten printers off the internet  which is a change over the last decade  now we ve got them behind at least a firewall  or router  or something   childs explains however  he adds   as we ve seen with printnightmare and other printer based exploits  you can get past that firewall and then attack a printer  then pivot from that to other targets within an enterprise   to prevent a printer compromise from reaching further into a network  smbs need to focus on properly segmenting different areas of their networks the best way to protect the printers themselves  meanwhile  is to patch  as childs recalls   i can t tell you how many times i ve heard of printers that were exploited that

76,february 7  2024commentarymajor sporting events such as the super bowl are fertile ground for threat actors  they attract huge audiences and offer a treasure trove of valuable data for hackers — from payment card data to user credentials that grant access to an organization s network  they also have a large concentration of high profile targets  including celebrities  media personalities  political dignitaries  and famous athletes it s not only the volume of targets and data that draw threat actors to these live events  they also create a sense of urgency  one of a hacker s greatest allies  if a threat actor can compromise critical systems  such as ticket entry or on premises point of sale  pos  payment systems  the venue  event organizers  and vendors may be highly motivated to pay a ransom to restore their systems quickly businesses must be extra vigilant in the lead up to super bowl lviii  as  for ransom  threats are increasingly significant  while ransomware is the best known  other  for ransom  threats include sustained distributed denial of service  ddos  attacks and exfiltration of sensitive or embarrassing data with the threat to disclose it unless the ransom is paid the offensive line up  adversary personasas in football  it s important to know your opponents  the adversary s offense can come at you from many angles cybercriminals are primarily driven by financial gain  look to monetize exploits quickly  and attack in large volumes  they are among the most prevalent of the threat actor lineup and often start attacking well before the event with social engineering and phishing campaigns to harvest credentials  then they double down during the event with more destructive actions  including launching  for ransom  attacks and deploying information stealing malware to siphon payment card data from pos systems hacktivists are generally driven by ideology  with website defacement their weapon of choice  these hacktivists are trying to get their message out  and what better time than when the huge super bowl audience is watching deliberate disruptors typically use ddos or destructive malware attacks to degrade or disrupt the event experience  deliberate disruption includes  for ransom  activities and disinformation and misinformation campaigns  often using social media and possibly deepfake technologies  to dissuade or persuade their target audience of something  usually nefarious  nation state or state affiliated threat actors are driven by national security  geopolitical positioning  and competitive advantage  these highly sophisticated cyber adversaries are drawn to large events due to their vip audiences and the types of intelligence they can potentially collect don t underestimate the home team advantagewhile it s common to focus on threats from foreign cybercriminal enterprises looking to do harm  don t overlook often inadvertent threat actors much closer to home employees with legitimate access to organizational resources can cause significant  usually unintentional  damage through mistakes and abuse of access privileges a temporary workforce  brought on to cover increased staffing demand  may have similar access rights as full time employees  but often undergo less scrutiny or security checks vendors and partners with physical or logical access to key resources can be a pivot point for threat actors through supply chain attacks  vendors and partners are often prime targets for attackers on their own how cyber adversaries do harmthe cyber adversary s playbook includes multiple tactics  techniques  and procedures  ttps  targeting infrastructure provided by the event venue  city and state governments  and third parties  such as local businesses  sponsors  and hospitality providers   these can degrade or disable services  often with the intent of financial gain through ransomware or ddos attacks increasing in social engineering campaigns using the event or related topics as lures to target and trick victims into giving up information including credentials or clicking links that trigger malware disseminating misinformation and disinformation — generally for

techniques to target and defraud tourists because they may have a harder time distinguishing between legitimate and malicious communications while outside their normal routines  this makes them especially vulnerable and attractive to cybercriminals businesses must also be wary of social engineering in the runup to the  big game   even though las vegas is home to some of the biggest hospitality brands in the world — companies with multimillion dollar cybersecurity budgets — social attacks can bypass even the most sophisticated security systems by targeting the biggest vulnerability of all  people businesses don t have time to do a complete cybersecurity overhaul ahead of super bowl weekend  but they do have time to remind employees of cybersecurity best practices  social attacks can target virtually any employee  and an educated workforce helps mitigate risk employees who learn how to spot the most common social engineering tactics — phishing  vishing  smishing  pretexting — can help reduce points of entry  remind employees to change passwords often and not use the same credentials across different systems and websites  if an employee s password has been compromised in another data breach  attackers can use it to gain access to your business also have incident response plans in place so that employees know how to respond if a suspicious incident happens  having a plan can prevent a wider breach  isolating incidents is just as important as preventing them consider partners wiselyattackers can also bypass sophisticated cybersecurity systems by targeting third party vendors  many major breaches are traced back to vulnerabilities in vendors with valuable data from larger companies  this should be a cause for concern for as super bowl event organizers  who work with a vast constellation of third party vendors  while it s too late to reevaluate vendors now  there may be time to evaluate third party exposure  touch base with vendor partners  and take measures to mitigate potential risk remove weak linksan organization s cybersecurity is only as strong as its weakest links  strong cybersecurity doesn t depend only on technology solutions  it s also about behaviors and culture  in that sense  cybersecurity is a manifestation of discipline  an organization may have rules to help prevent cyber incidents  but if they re not

80,mozilla adds paid for data deletion tier to monitor  its privacy breach radarfirefox maker promises to lean on personal info brokers to scrub recordsmozilla on tuesday expanded its free privacy monitoring service with a paid for tier called mozilla monitor plus that will try to get data brokers to delete their copies of subscribers  personal information mozilla introduced monitor in 2018 as a way to make people aware when their personal info may have been stolen  leaked  and or illicitly traded online  called firefox monitor at launch  and now mozilla monitor  it provides a service that s not just similar to the venerable haveibeenpwned com – it uses the hibp database as its source  if your personal info gets stolen or leaked by cybercriminals  and a record of that privacy breach is added to haveibeenpwned  monitor will automatically flag that up to you necessarily alert to revenue diversification opportunities in light of its dependence on google paying to be the default search service on its beleaguered firefox browser  mozilla has taken monitor beyond hibp alerts  added data removal  and branded that expanded service monitor plus with a subscription fee of  8 99 per month  or  107 88 per year  the idea being that  for paying users  monitor will do what it can to scrub their personal info from recognized data brokers that buy and sell netizens  details and records with other businesses  such as those folks  locations and online habits  while monitor flags up criminal activity  monitor plus deals with removing info from ostensibly legit brokers  we can t imagine the org will have much success persuading underworld fraudsters to remove people s records “when we launched monitor  our goal was to help people discover where their personal info may have been exposed   said tony amaral cinotto  product manager of mozilla monitor  in an announcement   now  with monitor plus  we’ll help people take back their exposed data from data broker sites that are trying to sell it  in doing so  mozilla joins more than a dozen other companies offering similar data removal services targeting a varying number of vendors  such as abine s deleteme   10 75 per month   optery   4  25 per month   and incogni   6 49 per month   among others these businesses contact data brokers and ask them to remove personal information  e g  name  email  address  phone number  from their info stores on behalf of netizens  a time consuming and onerous process if done manually mozilla claims monitor plus will work with over 190 data broker sites   twice the number of other competitors   as a point of comparison  opetery s top tier boasts removals from more than 305 sites  though at a cost of more than twice what mozilla is asking  and that falls well short of the 549 data brokers currently registered in the state of california s data broker registry  to say nothing of firms not doing business in the state or just operating illegally so mozilla monitor plus is an incomplete  temporary fix – sites may reacquire customer data  necessitating follow up removal requests – in a largely unregulated data broker business that has made few accommodations to demands for privacy   brit watchdog thinks google s tweaked privacy sandbox still isn t cricket   i m sorry for everything     facebook s zuck apologizes to families at senate hearing  microsoft edge ignores user wishes  slurps tabs from chrome without permission  amazon ring sounds death knell for surveillance as a serviceand the privacy situation has been grim for a while  a decade ago  in 2014  the ftc called on congress to do something about the data broker industry  and not a lot has happened since but by 2018  which saw facebook s cambridge analytica scandal and the implementation of europe s 2016 general data protection regulation  demands for data privacy and protection began showing results a year later  with browser rivals starting to block third party cookies by default  google saw the writing on the wall and set about designing its privacy sandbox advertising tools for a world grown wary of third party tracking and data gathering lately  info brokers have received a lot of attention – not enough to merit an actual federal privacy law but more than usual for the intervention averse us  the federal trade commission recently banned x mode social from sharing or selling location data us senator ron wyden  d or  called for domestic intelligence agencies to stop buying location data  and the biden administration is reportedly working on an executive order limiting data brokers from sharing or selling data on americans to foreign adversaries but the most significant development in the us in terms of data brokers has been california s delete act  which follows on the heels of the california consumer privacy act and the state s privacy rights act the delete act technically became law this year but should start showing its teeth two years from now  starting january 1  2026  the california privacy protection agency is supposed to deploy a one stop data deletion mechanism to allow consumers to request that data brokers stop tracking them and delete their personal info  and by august 1 that year data brokers will be required to process people s deletion requests every 45 days so two years hence or thereabout  monitor plus and related services may not be necessary for those in california – they ll no longer need to pay to recover the privacy taken from them without consent  at least with regard to third party brokers a mozilla spokesperson told the register the delete act is great news for californians   since the deletion mechanism will not be available until 2026  we wanted to ensure that people could begin protecting their privacy as quickly as possible  especially for people outside california who won t have this state protection   the spokesperson said  ®,marketing,regulatory changes and compliance,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.10512402653694153,

81,february 7  2024jetbrains has patched a critical security vulnerability in its teamcity on premises server that can allow unauthenticated remote attackers to gain control over an affected server and use it to perform further malicious activity within an organization s environment teamcity is a software development lifecycle  sdlc  management platform that about 30 000 organizations — including several major brands like citibank  nike  and ferrari — use to automate processes to build  test  and deploy software  as such  it s home to scores of data that can be useful to attackers  including source code and signing certificates  and also could allow for tampering with compiled versions software or deployment processes the flaw  tracked as cve 2024 23917  presents the weakness cwe 288  which is an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel  jetbrains identified the flaw on jan  19  it affects all versions from 2017 1 through 2023 11 2 of its teamcity on premises continuous integration and delivery  ci cd  server  if abused  the flaw may enable an unauthenticated attacker with http s  access to a teamcity server to bypass authentication checks and gain administrative control of that teamcity server   teamcity s daniel gallo wrote in a blog post detailing cve 2024 23917  published earlier this week jetbrains already has released an update that addresses the vulnerability  teamcity on premises version 2023 11 3  and also patched its own teamcity cloud servers  the company also verified that its own servers were not attacked teamcity s history of exploitationindeed  teamcity on premises flaws are not to be taken lightly  as the last major flaw discovered in the product spurred a global security nightmare when various state sponsored actors targeted it to engage in a range of malicious behavior in that case  a public proof of concept  poc  exploit for a critical remote code execution  rce  bug tracked as cve 2023 42793 — found by jetbrains and patched last sept  30 — triggered near immediate exploitation by two north korean state backed threat groups tracked by microsoft as diamond sleet and onyx sleet  the groups exploited the flaw to drop backdoors and other implants for carrying out a wide range of malicious activities  including cyber espionage  data theft  and financially motivated attacks then in december  apt29

long term access to the compromised network environments update or alternative mitigation recommendedhoping to avoid a similar scenario with its latest flaw  jetbrains urged anyone with affected products in their environment to immediately update to the patched version if this isn t possible  jetbrains also released a security patch plugin that s available for download and can be installed on teamcity versions 2017 1 through 2023 11 2 that will fix the issue  the company also posted installation instructions online for the plugin to help customers mitigate the issue teamcity stressed however that the security patch plugin will only address the vulnerability and not provide other fixes  so customers are highly recommended to install the latest version of teamcity on premises  to benefit from many other security updates   gallo wrote further  if an organization has an affected server that is publicly accessible over the internet and can t take either of those mitigation steps  jetbrains recommended that the server is made in accessible until the flaw can be mitigated considering the history of exploitation when it comes to teamcity bugs  patching is a necessary and crucial first step that organizations need to take to handle the issue  brian contos  cso at sevco security  observes  however  given that there could be internet facing servers that a company has lost track of  he suggests further steps may need to be taken to more firmly lock down an it environment  it s hard enough to defend the attack surface you know about  but it becomes impossible when there are

82,february 7  2024linux shim  a small piece of code that many major linux distros use during the secure boot process  has a remote code execution vulnerability in it that gives attackers a way to take complete control of affected systems all linux distributions that support secure boot  including red hat  ubuntu  debian  and suse are affected by the flaw  identified as cve 2023 40547  the flaw is the most severe of six vulnerabilities in linux shim that its maintainer red hat disclosed recently — and for which it has issued an update  shim 15 8   bill demirkapi  a researcher with microsoft s security response center who discovered the bug and reported it to red hat  has described it as every linux bootloader signed in the past decade out of bounds write errorin its advisory red hat said the bug had to do with the shim boot code trusting attacker controlled values when parsing an http response   this flaw allows an attacker to craft a specific malicious http request  leading to a completely controlled out of bounds write primitive and complete system compromise  the national vulnerability database  nvd  and red hat had slightly different takes on the severity of the vulnerability and its exploitability  the nvd assigned the bug a near maximum severity rating of 9 8 out of 10 on the cvss 3 1 scale and identified it as something that an attacker could exploit over the network with little complexity and requiring no user interaction or privileges red hat gave the bug a more modest severity score of 8 3 and described it as exploitable only through an adjacent network and involving high attack complexity  it was an assessment that maintainers of the other affected linux distros shared with ubuntu  for instance  calling cve 2023 40547 a  medium  severity bug and suse assigning it an  important  rating which typically is a notch lower than critical red hat explained the different severity scores thusly   cvss scores for open source components depend on vendor specific factors  e g  version or build chain   therefore  red hat s score and impact rating can be different from nvd and other vendors   both the nvd and red hat though agreed on the vulnerability having a high impact on data confidentiality  integrity  and availability a shim bootloader is basically a small app that loads prior to the main operating system bootloader on unified extensible firmware interface  uefi  based systems  it acts as a bridge between the uefi firmware and the main os bootloaders  which in the case of linux  is typically grub or system boot  its function is to verify the main os bootloader before loading and running it multiple attack vectorsresearchers from software supply chain security vendor eclypsium identified three different paths that an attacker could take to exploit the vulnerability  one is via a man in the middle  mitm  attack  where the adversary intercepts http traffic between the victim and the http server that serves the files to support http boot   the attacker could be located on any network segment between the victim and the legitimate server  an attacker with enough privileges on a vulnerable system could also exploit the vulnerability locally by manipulating data in extensible firmware interface  efi  variables or on the efi partitions   this can be accomplished with a live linux usb stick  the boot order can then be changed such that a remote and vulnerable shim is loaded on the system  an attacker on the same network as the victim can also manipulate the pre boot execution environment to chain load a vulnerable shim bootloader  eclypsium said   an attacker exploiting this vulnerability gains control of the system before the kernel is loaded  which means they have privileged access and the ability to circumvent any controls implemented by the kernel and operating system   the vendor noted exaggerated severity some security experts  though  perceived the vulnerability as requiring a high degree of complexity and happenstance to exploit  lionel litty  chief security architect at menlo security  says the exploitation bar is high because the attacker would need to already have gained administrator privileges on a vulnerable device  or they d need to be targeting a device that uses network boot and also be able to perform a man in the middle attack on the local network traffic of the targeted device  according to the researcher who found the vulnerability  a local attacker can modify the efi partition to modify the boot sequence to then be able to leverage the vulnerability   litty says    but  modifying the efi partition will require being a fully privileged admin on the victim machine   he says if the device is using network boot and the attacker can do mitm on the traffic  then that s when they can target the buffer overflow   they would return a malformed http response that would trigger the bug and give them control over the boot sequence at this point   litty says  he adds that organizations with machines using http boot or pre boot execution environment  pxe  boot should be concerned  especially if communication with the boot sever is in an environment where an adversary could insert themselves into the middle of traffic shachar menashe  senior director of security research at jfrog  says red hat s assessment of the vulnerability s severity is more accurate than nvds  over exaggerated  score there are two possible explanations for the discrepancy  he says   nvd provided the score based on keywords from the description  and not a thorough analysis of the vulnerability   he says  for example  assuming that  malicious http request  automatically translates to a network attack vector nvd may also be alluding to an extremely unlikely worst case scenario where the victim machine is already configured to boot via http from a server outside the local network and the attacker already has control over this http server   this is an extremely unlikely scenario which would cause tons of trouble even unrelated to this cve   shachar says about the author s you may also likedevsecops  the smart way to shift leftfeb 14

85,cybercrime duo accused of picking  2 5m from apple s orchardsecurity researcher buddies allegedly tag team a four month virtual gift card heist at cupertino tech gianta cybersecurity researcher and his pal are facing charges in california after they allegedly defrauded an unnamed company  almost certainly apple  out of  2 5 million noah roskin frazee and keith latteri are alleged to have gained access to apple s systems via a third party contractor and ordered gift cards and hardware to the value of  2 5 million and  100 000 respectively they are then said to have sold their stolen wares to third parties  cashing out on their theft and defrauding both apple and the customer support business it contracted out of millions while apple isn t explicitly named in the recently unsealed court papers  it s not difficult to deduce that the identity of  company a   as written in the indictment  is the consumer tech megacorp  company a was a corporation headquartered in cupertino  california  which developed  manufactured  licensed  supported  and sold computer software  consumer electronics  personal computers  and services   the indictment reads  describing company a  seems pretty apple y so far looking deeper into the case background  it s also revealed that one of the defendants redeemed one of the stolen gift cards to their personal app store account  where they purchased final cut pro – software developed by apple that only runs on apple hardware roskin frazee and latteri were able to order the glut of gift cards and hardware because they had access to a number of key apple backend systems one of these is a log program that allows customer support to search apple products and order replacements  another is the toolbox program which allows customer support staff to edit orders for a limited time after they re made the final important system at play here is the jamf mdm platform  which is operated by the third party contractor and allows configuration changes to be made to apple devices  but that s not what it was used for in this case how the scam unfoldedthe first port of call was gaining access to the contractor s systems  the pair allegedly did this by using what the court papers  pdf  describe as a password reset tool on a targeted account  from there  the pair used that first compromised account to unearth credentials for other staff accounts that  crucially  also had credentials for the company s vpn servers once connected to the customer support contractor s vpn  they could also access the company s remote desktop software  which they used to control computers owned by the contractor that were located in india and costa rica  the contractor s jamf mdm platform was used to access these computers and log them into desktop sharing sessions malicious scripts were run to create a reverse ssh tunnel between the indian and costa rican computers and the accused s microsoft azure account  which allowed continued remote access between around december 2018 and march 2019 these remotely operated computers  run using the contractor s legitimate credentials and vpn server  were used to gain access to what the court documents describe as  company a s connect application   which is probably apple s app store connect  with this access  roskin frazee and latteri were able to take control of toolbox and manipulate orders  it is alleged after the pair and their family members  using fake names and email addresses  placed more than two dozen orders through apple  roskin frazee and latteri allegedly used toolbox to make critical order amendments during the short window of opportunity  these included extending existing service contracts  adding more products to the orders  and changing all prices to zero   verizon says 63k employees  info fell into the wrong hands – an insider this time  samsung heir lee jae yong acquitted of stock manipulation charges  fujitsu finance chief says sorry for it giant s role in post office horizon scandal  solarwinds slams sec lawsuit against it as  unprecedented  victim blamingtransshipment companies shipito llc and amboy technologies llc were used to ship the products while concealing the pair s addresses – another means of hiding their identities  amboy was the first port of call  but the fake account the pair created with the company was terminated due to fraud concerns  however  they later allegedly had more success using shipito apple says  thanks  funnily enough  in a december 2023 security update – published one day before roskin frazee s indictment – apple acknowledged the security researcher  and his colleague  prof  j   of zeroclicks lab  for reporting a bug affecting macos ventura that could have allowed an app to access data from a user s contacts the issue is tracked as cve 2023 42894 – not the most serious bug in the world but serves as a rare oddity in the world of cybercrime where it s highly unusual for an alleged criminal to be thanked for ethical research after they had spent months allegedly defrauding the very same company years earlier roskin frazee was also solely credited with the finding of cve 2023 38593  a denial of service vulnerability impacting ios and ipados earlier in july 2023 roskin frazee was a legitimate  recognized security researcher who had also led talks at conferences such as isaca s digital trust world

87,a tangled web of attackers use various social media tactics to propagate the novel threat  which has several execution methods and exfiltrates data to telegram february 8  2024a novel stealer malware called  ov3r stealer  is making the rounds on facebook  spreading through job ads and accounts on the social media platform  and using various execution methods to steal reams of data from unwitting victims the malware by design exfiltrates specific types of data such as geolocation  based on ip   hardware info  passwords  cookies  credit card information  auto fills  browser extensions  crypto wallets  office documents  and antivirus product information  according to researchers from trustwave spiderlabs  it sends the info a telegram channel being monitored by the threat actors the researchers first discovered the stealer in early december  it was being spread via a facebook job advertisement for an account manager position  they revealed in a blog post and report published this week  later  they discovered that the actors behind the malware also use facebook based scams — including the creation of fake accounts — to spread the malware eventually  weaponized links delivered through the ad lead to a malicious discord content delivery url  which executed the stealer using a powershell script masquerading as a windows control panel  cpl  binary to download the malware  in the form of three files from a github site but what really sets ov3r stealer apart is having several execution methods  in addition to the powershell vector  ov3r stealer also can be executed on a victim s machine via html smuggling  svg image smuggling  and  lnk shortcut files masquerading as innocuous text documents down the cyberattacker rabbit holeonce researchers followed the stolen data to telegram  they found a rather complex origin story behind ov3r stealer  as the malware appears to have a range of threat actors behind it who conspire via multiple communication channels and platforms specifically  the researchers uncovered various pseudonyms  communication channels  and repositories for the stolen data that hold clues to who s behind it and how they work  aliases such as  liu kong    mr meta   meoblacka  and  john macollan  were found in groups like  pwn3rzs chat    golden dragon lounge    data pro   and  kgb forums   where many  researchers   threat actors  and curious folk gather  meetup  and exchange hacks  malware  and cracked software daily   according to the report it s unknown exactly how attackers use the data once it s stolen  but possibilities including selling it or using it for phishing  to boot  ov3r stealer can also be used in a modular way as a dropper for other malware or post exploit tools  up to and including ransomware  the researchers said ov3r stealer s various execution strategiesas mentioned  once a victim is compromised  the stealer uses several unique execution methods  the researchers observed one and gleaned a few others from sample code  one loader used windows cpl files — which are generally used for system settings within windows — to run a remote powershell script to download the malware s three files another method indicated by sample data is through html smuggling  which uses a weaponized html file  customcursor html  to load the customcursor zip file that includes the malware files a third execution method is through a shortcut file   lnk   the victim is presented with a file masquerading as a typical text file called attitude reports txt  located within a zip archive  the actual file within the zip archive  however  is a malicious  lnk file called attitude reports txt lnk  once opened  it will redirect the victim to the github repository  as the cpl loader does  to download the actual payload attackers also use a technique called svg smuggling to execute the file in a method that exploits the winrar code execution vulnerability  cve 2023 38831   this method works similarly to html smuggling  except that the malicious files are embedded within a vector graphics file  svg   this redirects to a “copyright report svg  file that  once opened  embeds and loads a  rar file that contains a windows  lnk shortcut file to download a powershell script to deliver the payload that final payload is ultimately delivered in three files that are nested  werfaultsecure exe  a legitimate windows executable  wer dll  a malicious file that werfaultsecure loads  and secure pdf  which contains malicious code that wer dll will load once executed  the malware will establish persistence through the copying of its files to the c  users public libraries books folder and the creation of a windows scheduled task called  licensing2  which runs every 90 minutes to ensure continuous data exfiltration a malware poised to go bigthough trustwave has not yet seen wide ranging campaigns using this malware  the researchers believe it remains under continual development and continues to pose an existing threat  they included a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise  iocs  in their report to help organizations identify the malware in their environment  as ov3r stealer has been actively developed with multiple loader techniques  we may see this one eventually be sold or used in other campaigns in the future   according to the report to avoid compromise or mitigate attacks by ov3r stealer  trustwave recommended that organizations implement  active and engaging  security awareness programs to help people spot malicious campaigns on social media and other attacker strategies organizations also should use regular application and service audits and baselining  as well as practice up to date application patching to mitigate threats  the researchers added  further  they should continuously hunt threats throughout their environments to pick up undetected compromises before they have time to do damage  they added about the author s you may also

88,if you ve listened to software vendors in the identity space lately  you will have noticed that  unified  has quickly become the buzzword that everyone is adopting to describe their portfolio  and this is great  unified identity has some amazing benefits however  there is always a however  right   not every  unified   identity   security   platform  is made equal  some vendors call the combination of workforce idaas and customer idaas a unified identity solution  while others offer a glorified 2fa service – unified only in the mind of their marketers your landscape matters so forget for a moment what the vendors claim  and think back to your organization and your identity security landscape  consider this new definition   unified  is what has the ability to consolidate your identity challenges with a complete identity solution here s an example  you re responsible for the identity infrastructure of a large hospital  frontline workers  administrative employees  audit compliance needs and a large number of external users  you are using active directory  and your lob application doesn t do identity  for this hospital  unified identity means strong access management for customers and frontline workers  strong joiner leaver mover handling  ad hardening and enterprise grade reporting  anything less fails the unified promise and means their internal identity landscape stays fractured another example  a small software dev studio  they need extra strong controls on privileged access management  pam  to protect the development pipeline and make sure they won t become the initial attack vector in a supply chain attack  but they also need identity governance and administration  iga  for machine entities and their owners  working on the many automated tasks they are running  a solution which covers pam and iga independently from each other is not unified what is the value of unified identity anyways so why has  unified identity   become such a hot buzzword  well  there are some really good arguments for it  traditionally  the identity space was very fractured  with many experts not even considering it a singular market until fairly recently  identity governance and administration  iga   access management  am   and privileged access management  pam  were the key sub markets  with a wide array of adjacent spaces such as ad bridging and endpoint privilege management the key driver for unified identity is this extreme fragmentation  a large organization has on average 45 different security tools  add to this the identity sprawl  a trend where organizations keep getting more and more identity silos in house – a one identity survey shows half the organizations are using more than 25 different systems to manage access rights  this is simply not sustainable  and adding a new tool each time a new threat approaches is completely unworkable  so organizations are looking to consolidate vendors  reduce complexity and slim down the number of suppliers they work with  the benefits of a unified identity platform are a better cybersecurity posture and greater resilience in the face of security threats  whilst increasing simplicity and enabling agility another reason is top line cost  bundles  volume discounts and elas are a simple way to reduce costs  vendor consolidation also brings some less obvious savings too  a single tech stack helps the skills gap  easing the stress on hiring and training  which in turn means significant savings on headcount and may lessen the requirement for highly trained senior staff  creating more value from security with less resources or put another way  working smarter not harder integration is a key aspect of the identity landscape – and one of the largest headaches  security tools need to work together smoothly  but that s rarely a given  the industry is not keen on common standards  which makes interoperability very hard to achieve  with some effort  meaning customization  support hours and overhead  identity solutions can work together pairwise  but creating a complete ecosystem of identity tools that work flawless together is a rare achievement  it s easy to see the value a unified identity platform brings here  the tools are pre tested  pre validated to work together  usually without any customization required  and the platform components are supported as one by the vendor this brings us to the final benefit  faster time to value  an expression worthy of any mba graduate  identity and access management  iam  projects are famous for taking a long time to implement  as specialists meticulously formalize business processes and implement them in code or configuration  in large organizations  this is an incredibly complex task  as the iam setup needs to mirror every aspect  and quirk  the business has built up – sometimes over decades  implementations become so complex that they just fail – the cost and time overruns exceeding the patience of business leaders  in a nutshell  time to value matters in iam  and a unified identity solution removes the complexity of the multi vendor approach  eliminating at least one factor after these benefits  let s talk a downside  vendor lock in  unified identity sounds wonderful but betting the house on a single vendor is a high ask  and what if you already have some solutions in place that you re happy with  it s important to remember that not all unified identity vendors are the same  some vendors offer modular identity platforms which allow you to keep what you want and unify what you need  this approach enables customers to start the unification at any point  for example with pam  without the need to embrace and implement all areas in one giant leap  when picking vendors  look for this flexible approach ,news and industry updates,marketing,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.09878228604793549, 'security updates and patches': 0.15421997010707855, 'emerging threats and attack techniques':

96,fake lastpass lookalike made it into apple app storeno walled garden can keep out every weed  we supposelastpass says a rogue application impersonating its popular password manager made it past apple s gatekeepers and was listed in the ios app store for unsuspecting folks to download and install the software maker went public about the fake mobile app on wednesday  warning that the knockoff  lastpass password manager   developed by someone calling themselves parvati patel  appeared to be trying to confuse users into running the thing and possibly steal their data or credentials a screenshot of the fake lastpass app in the apple app store  note the misspellings  incorrect developer name and single rating     click to enlarge upon seeing the fake  lasspass  app in the apple app store  lastpass immediately began a coordinated and multi faceted approach across our threat intelligence  legal and engineering teams to get the fraudulent app removed   christofer hoff  chief secure technology officer for lastpass  told the register thursday  we are in direct contact with representatives from apple  and they have confirmed receipt of our complaints  and we are working through the process to have the fraudulent app removed   hoff added cupertino may have been on the case but earlier today the app was still available in the store  el reg asked apple why the fake lastpass app was still up  and while we didn t receive a response  the app s url stopped working and the application disappeared from app store search results on an iphone within a few minutes of our email in other words  it s now gone how d this weed make it into the walled garden apps of questionable value aside  apple has a reputation for being a relatively safe place for the average iperson to get their software  with a notoriously tough app approval process standing between developers and users apple even updated its developer agreement and review guidelines last year to add a specific prohibition on apps that impersonate others  the design section of the app review guidelines even calls out developers who take such an approach  though it s more concerned with laziness than maliciousness  come up with your own ideas   apple demands from developers   submitting apps which impersonate other apps or services is considered a violation of the developer code of conduct and may result in removal from the apple developer program  of course  the system isn t perfect  and the occasional weed gets through the wall and into the garden  lastpass  impersonator isn t the first  though it is a particularly egregious case   forcing apple to allow third party app stores isn t enough  beware cool looking beta crypto apps  they may be money stealing fakes  almost 300 predatory loan apps found in google and apple stores  over a million android users fooled by fake whatsapp app in official google play storewhile it s understandable some questionable ip theft could occur on the app store on occasion  this is a total impersonation of a well known brand  we d love to know how this blunder happened  though we re unlikely to get an answer  lastpass wants to know too   we re  working with apple to understand more broadly how an application like this passed their normally rigorous security and brand protection mechanisms   hoff told us   the naming convention  the iconography and the description of the fraudulent app are all heavily borrowed from lastpass  and this appears to be a deliberate attempt to target lastpass users  separating the apps from the trapseven with its insistence that opening the app store to competition would lead to greater threats to user safety  apple s content rules still aren t completely solid  while we re confident that our readers know well how to spot a fake app from a real one  it s worth reminding everyone how to avoid being tricked into downloading a fake   and this fake lastpass app is rife with examples there s the obvious signs  like misspellings in app descriptions or in screenshots  the fake lastpass app  screenshotted in this story  actually shows a preview image telling users they can  store all your passwords with lasspass    a good way to tell you re dealing with a faker  assuming legitimate developers have an editor there s also the developer name  which in lastpass  case should be  logmein  inc    not a random person  other apps from big providers  the most obvious ones to be targeted for impersonation  should likewise match the actual company behind the product the fake lastpass app also only showed itself as having a single five star rating  while the real lastpass app has some 52k reviews  a legitimate app is unlikely please everyone  either  and lastpass is no different   the real app is rated 4 4 out of five stars additionally  four one star reviews on the fake lastpass app that didn t seem to affect its overall score came from users warning that it was a scam  so there s two lessons to learn here  pay attention to the number of reviews on a supposedly legitimate app  and give them a read  too along with those elements  look at the age of the app  and also take a look at the app privacy report baked into every page in the app store   if an app doesn t seem like it needs to link certain types of data to you  sudoku doesn t need to access user content or know your location   then skip it   even if legit the developer might be selling your data as high as they may be  the walls around tim s garden can t keep out all the garbage  so be careful  ®,emerging threats and attack

99,one of most important malware loaders to cybercrims who are jumping on vulnerabilities faster than everresearchers suspect the criminals behind the raspberry robin malware are now buying exploits for speedier cyberattacks an exploit developer is thought by infosec pros to be either on the raspberry robin payroll or a close contact that sells them to the group – most likely the latter  that s according to check point research  cpr  which has tracked how long it takes for vulnerability exploits to be added as features to the malware it means the criminals behind it are prioritizing the speed of development to maximize their chances of successful attacks  raspberry robin continues to use different exploits for vulnerabilities either before or only a short time after they were publicly disclosed   said cpr   those one day exploits were not publicly disclosed at the time of their use  an exploit for one of the vulnerabilities  cve 2023 36802  was also used in the wild as a zero day and was sold on the dark web  very few knew about cve 2023 36802 until microsoft addressed it as part of its september 2023 patch tuesday updates  however  cyfirma spotted an exploit for it being sold on the dark web as early as february of that year  seven months before the security advisories began popping up the earliest signs of raspberry robin abusing cve 2023 36802 came in october  just weeks after patch tuesday and the same month that public exploit code was made available researchers believe this points to the team s access to a developer given the time it took to start making use of the vulnerability  especially compared to a year earlier when it was using year old vulns it is possible the raspberry robin team stumbled upon the february exploit and bought that  or someone in house may have quickly developed their own after spotting it in microsoft s update list  but this is seen as the less likely option another case from earlier in 2023 also pointed to the possibility of raspberry robin s ties to sophisticated developers  after looking at samples of raspberry robin prior to october  we found that it also used an exploit for cve 2023 29360   said cpr   this vulnerability was publicly disclosed in june and was used by raspberry robin in august  even though this is a pretty easy vulnerability to exploit  the fact that the exploit writer had a working sample before there was a known exploit in github is impressive as is how quickly raspberry robin used it   psst … wanna jailbreak chatgpt  thousands of malicious prompts for sale  why we update

banking sessions this exploit also has the same loader and the same obfuscation scheme for the strings as the cve 2023 36802 exploit and the flow is similar  interestingly  this vulnerability is also in the mskssrv sys  meaning the exploit writer is working on this driver  we may see other vulnerabilities in the driver being exploited in the wild  analysis of the malware showed that these exploits were being used as external 64 bit executables  which to the cpr researchers indicates that they were bought rather than developed in house  if the raspberry robin authors were the developers of the exploits  then they would have probably used the exploits in the main component itself   said cpr   in addition  the exploits would be packed in the same way and have the same format as the different stages of the main component  the fact that these executables were 64 bit only hints towards outside development  since raspberry robin was developed for both 32 bit and 64 bit architectures the abuses also didn t use the same high degree of obfuscation techniques as raspberry robin s main component does  such as control flow flattening and variable masking raspberry robin plays an important role in the world of cybercrime and is trusted by many of the major criminal groups that are tracked by security researchers  such as evilcorp  ta505  icedid  and various ransomware affiliates last year it was named as one of the three malware loaders that were jointly responsible for 80 percent of cyberattacks between january and august 2023  alongside qbot and socgholish in publishing its suspicions about raspberry robin s shift toward buying exploits  cpr also found an array of new features had been added  the malware is well known for its regular updates  especially focused on anti evasion techniques  and the latest version is no different it comes loaded with new methods to prevent researchers from analyzing its inner workings as well as new routines for surviving system shutdowns  minor updates to its communication and lateral movement logic have also made it through the pipeline  ®,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack

101,cybersecurity in depth  feature articles on security strategy  latest trends  and people to know why demand for tabletop exercises is growingtabletop exercises can be an effective and affordable way to test an organization s defense and response capabilities against cyberattack february 8  2024organizations that are regularly defending against cyberattacks can find it useful to occasionally take a step back and test their defense and response capabilities  one way to do this is through cybersecurity drills  which provide organizations with a snapshot of their ability to handle ransomware  phishing  and other attacks cybersecurity drills come in many forms  including penetration testing  phishing simulations  and live fire exercises  with some scenarios costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and running over several days or even weeks the least complex of these drills are tabletop exercises  which typically run for two to four hours and can cost less than  50 000  sometimes much less   with much of the expense related to planning and facilitating the event unlike some other drills  tabletop exercises often don t involve attacks on live it systems  instead  a facilitator lays out a cyberattack scenario and employees of the client organization discuss the steps they would take in response this common approach to tabletop exercises is old school and low tech  but proponents say a well run scenario can expose holes in organizations  response and mitigation plans tabletop exercises are in demanddemand for tabletop exercises has grown exponentially in the past two years  driven by compliance issues  board directives  and cyber insurance mandates  says mark lance  vice president of incident response at guidepoint security  a cybersecurity consulting firm in some cases  employees ask for tabletop exercises to help educate executives   people want their senior leadership teams to understand the true impacts of a potential incident   lance says many cybersecurity organizations promote tabletop exercises as a way for organizations to test and improve their incident response and internal and external communication plans following a cyberattack  the nonprofit center for internet security calls tabletops  a must   stressing that they help organizations better coordinate separate business units in response to an attack and identify the employees who will play critical roles during and after an attack there are no cut and paste ways to run a tabletop exercise  though the us cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency provides packages to help organizations get started  some organizations run tabletops with internal teams  although the more common approach is to hire an outside cybersecurity vendor how tabletop exercises workin a typical tabletop  the facilitator leads a discussion by asking a series of questions  for example  a scenario can start with an employee calling into a help desk after seeing unusual activity on the company s network  some questions in a tabletop for it teams might be what are your next steps how are you performing that investigation how are you correlating that activity to other activities in your environment how is that tracked in an incident ticket when does the activity reach a certain level of severity when do you bring in your incident management team a tabletop for executives might include the following questions an incident has been reported — when are we bringing in external counsel when are we using our cyber insurance policy when should internal and external notifications go out who is drafting the notifications tabletops can start with hundreds of different scenarios  including widespread problems like ransomware and phishing attacks  however  individual tabletops need to focus specifically on the organization or its industry to be successful  lance says  adding that the success or failure of a tabletop depends largely on the provider s ability to plan the exercise and target it to the specific client  the more specific it is to their environment  the more inclined they are to stay engaged and interested  because there s a level of authenticity and validity to it   he says guidepoint  for example  taps its own threat intelligence team to come up with real world scenarios that are realistic to the client and are recent or emerging threats another way to ensure success is by running separate tabletop exercises for an organization s senior leadership and technical teams  lance says these two groups benefit from different scenarios  executives often want to talk about companywide issues and high level decisions that need to be made  in contrast  technical people want to get into the nitty gritty of stopping and mitigating an attack  if you do a technical tabletop  your technical resources might not open up the same way if you have senior leadership sitting in with them   lance says   in the other direction  senior leadership may not want to seem nontechnical or stupid in front of their technical resources  so they might not open up as much   with both groups involved   you have too loud of a voice in the room  learning through realistic scenariosin addition to failing to provide a realistic scenario  facilitators of tabletop exercises also can falter by failing to keep a group engaged or by being more of an observer than a leader  says curtis fechner  cyber practice leader and engineering fellow at cybersecurity consulting and integration provider optiv  participant engagement is the biggest factor in a tabletop s success  he adds  if i m very passive   fechner says   if i m not prompting questions or challenging their responses and just passively letting them talk  or if you get a group of people  complaining  among themselves about a problem  that kills the exercise  the momentum  and the energy  however  if you ve planned for a relevant scenario and kept the participants engaged  it s difficult for a tabletop exercise to fail  he says  a well facilitated discussion will result in participants learning about their organization s incident response plans and identifying areas that could be improved most cybersecurity exercises contain a learning curve for everyone involved  says peter manev  co founder and chief strategy officer of stamus networks  a network detection and response provider  in december  stamus networks participated in a live fire exercise called crossed swords  organized by the nato cooperative cyber defence center of excellence  ccdcoe  the best outcomes to tabletop exercises are when  the teams are clicking together  learning together  exchanging information and experiences  and  of course  making progress   manev says   in my view  if that happens  you ve already accomplished something  at the end of an exercise  fechner likes to take a half hour to discuss the lessons learned throughout  he asks participants what they think they did well and where the pain points were  that  to me  is a successful tabletop right there — when you get those people to actually do that sort of self analysis and come out with that introspection   he says   when problems get called out  that  to me  defines a successful tabletop exercise  as they assess their exercise  participants should be focused on continuous improvement of cybersecurity practices  fechner adds   the nice thing with a tabletop is it s a no failure sort of event   he says   realistically  it s all about exposing these opportunities to grow and improve  about the author s you may also

104,brazil  the world s center for banking trojan malware  has produced one of its most advanced tools yet  and as history shows  coyote may soon expand its territory february 8  2024researchers have discovered a novel banking trojan they dubbed  coyote   which is hunting for credentials for 61 different online banking applications  coyote   detailed by kaspersky in an analysis today  is notable both for its broad targeting of banking sector apps  the majority  for now  in brazil   and its sophisticated interweaving of different rudimentary and advanced components  a relatively new open source installer called squirrel  nodejs  an unsung programming language called  nim   and more than a dozen malicious functionalities  in all  it represents a notable evolution in brazil s thriving market for financial malware — and could spell big trouble down the line for security teams if it expands its focus  they ve been developing banking trojans for more than 20 years — they started in the year 2000   fabio assolini  head of the latin american global research and analysis team  great  at kaspersky  says of brazilian malware developers   in 24 years of developing and bypassing new authentication methods and new protection technologies  they ve been very creative  and you can see it now with this very new trojan  it may be a brazil focused threat to consumers for now  but as mentioned  there are clear reasons for organizations to be aware of coyote  for one  as assolini warns   the malware families that had success in tackling the brazil market in the past have also expanded abroad  that s why corporations and banks must be prepared to deal with it  and another reason for security teams to pay attention to the emergence of new banking trojans is their history of evolving into fully fledged initialaccess trojans and backdoors  this was the case with emotet and trickbot  for instance  and more recently  qakbot and ursinif coyote has functionality in the wings to follow suit  it can execute a range of commands  including directives to take screenshots  log keystrokes  kill processes  shut down the machine  and move its cursor  it can also outright freeze the machine with a fake  working on updates …  overlay the coyote trojan runs with squirrel   nimso far in its attacks  coyote behaves like any other modern banking trojan  when a compatible app is triggered on an infected machine  the malware pings an attacker controlled command and control  c2  server displays an appropriate phishing overlay on the victim s screen in order to capture a user s login information  coyote stands out most  though  for how it combats potential detections most banking trojans utilize windows installers  msi   kaspersky noted in its blog post  making them an easy red flag for cybersecurity defenders  that s why coyote opts for squirrel  a legitimate open source tool for installing and updating windows desktop apps  using squirrel  coyote attempts to mask its malicious initial stage loader as a perfectly honest update packager  its final stage loader is even more unique  as it s written in a relatively niche programming language called  nim   this is the very first banking trojan kaspersky has identified using nim  most of the old banking trojans were written in delphi  which is quite old and utilized across a lot of families  so over the years  the detection of delphi malware got very good  and the efficiency of infections was slowing down over the years   assolini explains  with nim   they have a more modern language to program with new features and a low rate of detection by security software  brazilian banking trojans are a global problemif coyote has to do so much to distinguish itself  it s because the world s fifth largest nation has in recent years become the world s premier hub for banking malware and for as much as they terrorize brazilians  these programs also have a habit of crossing bodies of water  these guys are very experienced in developing banking trojans  and they re eager to expand their attacks worldwide   assolini emphasizes   right now  we can find brazilian bank trojans attacking companies and people as far away as australia and europe  this week  a member of my team found a new version of one in italy  to demonstrate the potential future for a tool like coyote  assolini points to grandoreiro  a similar trojan that made serious inroads into mexico and spain but also well beyond  by the end of last fall  he says  it had reached a total of 41 countries a byproduct of that success  however  was increased scrutiny from law enforcement  in a step toward disrupting its free flowing cyber underground for this kind of malware  brazilian police made a rare move  they executed five temporary arrest warrants and 13 search and seizure warrants  for the architects behind grandoreiro across five brazilian states  the problem in brazil is they don t have very good local law enforcement for punishing these attackers  it works better when you have an entity outside of the country applying some pressure  as happened with granadoreiro  when the police and banks in spain were pressuring brazilian federal police to catch these guys   assolini says so  he concludes   they re getting better  but there s a long way to go  because a lot of cybercriminals are still free  in brazil  and committing

112,the usa government on wednesday said the chinese state sponsored hacking group known as volt typhoon had been embedded into some critical infrastructure networks in the country for at least five years targets of the threat actor include communications  energy  transportation  and water and wastewater systems sectors in the usa and guam  volt typhoon s choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations  and the usa authoring agencies assess with high confidence that volt typhoon actors are pre positioning themselves on it networks to enable lateral movement to ot assets to disrupt functions   the usa government said the idea is to pre position themselves on it networks by maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time for disruptive or destructive cyber attacks against usa critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the country the joint advisory  which was released by the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency  cisa   national security agency  nsa   and the federal bureau of investigation  fbi   was also backed by other nations that are part of the five eyes  fvey  intelligence alliance comprising australia  canada  new zealand  the u k volt typhoon – which is also called bronze silhouette  insidious taurus  unc3236  vanguard panda  or voltzite – is a stealthy china based cyber espionage group that s believed to be active since june 2021 it first came to light in may 2023 when fvey and microsoft revealed that the hacking crew managed to establish a persistent foothold into critical infrastructure organizations in the usa and guam for extended periods of time sans getting detected by principally leveraging living off the land  lotl  techniques  this kind of tradecraft  known as  living off the land   allows attackers to operate discreetly  with malicious activity blending in with legitimate system and network behavior making it difficult to differentiate – even by organizations with more mature security postures   the u k  national cyber security centre  ncsc  said another hallmark tactic adopted by volt typhoon is the use of multi hop proxies like kv botnet to route malicious traffic through a network of compromised routers and firewalls in the usa to mask its true origins cybersecurity firm crowdstrike  in a report published in june 2023  called out its reliance on an extensive arsenal of open source tooling against a narrow set of victims to achieve its strategic goals  volt typhoon actors conduct extensive pre exploitation reconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment  tailor their tactics  techniques  and procedures  ttps  to the victim s environment  and dedicate ongoing resources to maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time  even after initial compromise   the agencies noted  the group also relies on valid accounts and leverages strong operational security  which combined  allows for long term undiscovered persistence  furthermore  the nation state has been observed attempting to obtain administrator credentials within the network by exploiting privilege escalation flaws  subsequently leveraging the elevated access to facilitate lateral movement  reconnaissance  and full domain compromise the ultimate goal of the campaign is to retain access to the compromised environments   methodically  re targeting them over years to validate and expand their unauthorized accesses  this meticulous approach  per the agencies  is evidenced in cases where they have repeatedly exfiltrated domain credentials to ensure access to current and valid accounts  in addition to leveraging stolen account credentials  the actors use lotl techniques and avoid leaving malware artifacts on systems that would cause alerts   cisa  fbi  and nsa said  their strong focus on stealth and operational security allows them to maintain long term  undiscovered persistence  further  volt typhoon s operational security is enhanced by targeted log deletion to conceal their actions within the compromised environment  the development comes as the citizen lab revealed a network of at least 123 websites impersonating local news outlets spanning 30 countries in europe  asia  and latin america that s pushing pro china content in a widespread influence campaign linked to a beijing public relations firm named shenzhen haimaiyunxiang media co   ltd the toronto based digital watchdog  which dubbed the

113,february 8  2024the outcome of this year s super bowl matchup between the kansas city chiefs and the san francisco 49ers on feb  11 at the allegiant stadium in las vegas will likely remain unknown until the last down of the game  but one thing that is already abundantly clear is that attackers will have no shortage of targets to blitz at the event the nfl s continuing digitization of almost all aspects of the event  from ticketing to gate access systems and virtually every other point of contact with fans  has opened new vulnerabilities and targets that its security team has had to secure  concerns include threats to arena security  ransomware attacks on critical systems  phishing and credential theft  and threats to personal data and other sensitive information belonging to fans  nfl employees  players  and coaches preparing for the big  security  gamein a conversation with dark reading at the beginning of the 2023 2024 season  nfl ciso tomás maldonado had identified ai enabled phishing attacks and deepfake audio and video scams as adding to the slew of other existing security challenges the league has had to contend with in general the nfl itself has been preparing for some time to identify and assess threats to the super bowl—easily the most watched tv event each year—and to implement plans for dealing with them  last september  league officials in coordination with 100 other stakeholders  including the us department of homeland security and the cybersecurity and infrastructure agency  cisa   conducted a tabletop exercise where they ran through a series of attack scenarios that together had a cascading impact on physical systems supporting the event that exercise was part of an ongoing effort between the nfl and the other participants to prepare for whatever security challenge might surface at the game  stakeholders added that the preparation will be especially key considering the heightened geopolitical tensions around events in the middle east the security implications of sporting event digitizationkarl mattson  field ciso at noname security  views api related security issues as likely a big focus for attackers this year  given the nfl s extensive digital transformation in recent years  api threats surrounding the super bowl come in three areas  the fan digital experience  advertising  and event infrastructure   mattson says the most likely scenario  if an api related attack were to happen  is a large scale compromise of nfl fan personal information stolen  which may include authentication or biometric information  he notes  the digital fan experience of purchasing tickets  merchandise shopping  online betting  and other interactions all utilize services enabled by apis   each aspect of a fan consuming the nfl s product involves the exchange of personal or payment information which can be exploited by an attacker who discovers a poorly controlled api   he says the same is true for advertisers who air commercials during the event  and set up a new website or service to field consumer response  without first battle testing them for a flood of visitors or ddos efforts  the effort can fumble  mattson points to the memorable 2022 super bowl ad by coinbase that included only a bouncing qr code  which pointed viewers to a promotion website the company had set up for the ad  the website ended up crashing shortly after the ad aired because of the sheer volume of visitors physical event specific and public infrastructure to support the super bowl are also enabled by api first technologies  the stadium s 5g network  local security and emergency services  and public utility systems all use api based services for routine operations that attackers could potentially seek to disrupt  mattson says online gambling  a breeding ground for new scamsthe rise of online gambling and sports betting opens up a new gridiron for cyberattackers  the phenomenon has created a breeding ground for new and evolving scams targeting events like the super bowl  says stuart wells  cto at jumio  a plethora of betting apps and websites are readily available at our fingertips  attracting a wider audience  including younger demographics more accustomed to digital interactions   wells says  this accessibility  unfortunately  coincides with a rise in synthetic identity fraud  where criminals create fake identities using a false name and bits and pieces of stolen identity information — such as a real birth date and social security numbers  synthetic identity fraud  in particular  can be tricky for gaming operators as it makes malicious actors extremely difficult to trace   wells notes   if an attacker can bypass defenses and operate under a synthetic identity  they may be able to operate undetected  meaning that operators might not catch a fraudster until a player s account has been manipulated or some kind of fraud has been committed  exacerbating the situation is the relative lack of privacy protections in many of the betting apps that people use to make wagers during events like the super bowl  a new study by data privacy company incogni examined seven of the most popular betting apps  most of them are collecting and sharing private data extensively without proper disclosure the biggest data hog was draftkings  which incogni found was gathering 22 data points from users  including their precise location  contacts  messages  photos  and videos  betting apps from caesars  sky bet  and william hill were relatively close behind  gathering 17 data points each  including precise location  in app search history  health information  and purchase histories  meanwhile  caesars led the rest when it came to sharing the data it collects from user devices with third parties super bowl fans should also expect a surge of fake tickets and counterfeit merchandise in online marketplaces  tempting fans with jerseys  hats  and memorabilia that look real but are cheaply made and lack official logos  well says  all of these scams are likely to make their way to consumers via phishing emails and texts  consumers should proceed with caution and verify who they are doing business with before handing over any personal information or payment   he warns business risk from unauthorized streaming sitesken carnesi  ceo of dnsfilter  points to unauthorized streaming sites as a risk for organizations that let employees use unmanaged devices for work related purposes  data that the company gathered from its network over the last month showed a sharp increase in blocked sites with  nfl  in the domain name  he says  traffic increased on our network during the playoffs  peaking on jan  28  the same day as the afc and nfc championship game   carnesi says   overall  from jan  5 to the peak on jan  28  it was a 125  increase in security blocked traffic  risks to organizations that permit work related devices for personal use without any controls include a heightened likelihood of malware infections and phishing attacks  additionally  these streaming activities can create network vulnerabilities  with insecure channels and peer to peer connections posing risks to the organization s data integrity   carnesi says   data exfiltration is also an increased possibility  potentially exposing sensitive company information from illicit sites collecting and misusing user

116,february 8  2024commentaryhospitals and medical device manufacturers must team up to help create a secure environment to protect the personal health information derived from patient monitors and other medical devices for some time  this notion of shared responsibility for data security has been recognized as a best practice within the larger technology industry  for example  many cloud service providers follow this model to define the mutual security obligations of the cloud providers and their customers within healthcare  a similar model has emerged  with medical researchers  developers  and regulatory bodies agreeing that cybersecurity is  in fact  a shared responsibility  this means medical device manufacturers  hospital software providers  and health organizations must collaborate to shield patient information and medical device systems against cybercriminal activity understanding roles in medical device data securitythe us fda requires medical device manufacturers and software providers to follow a process called security by design  which maintains that certain controls must be embedded in a product to make it easier for hospitals to deploy and use them securely features such as configurable encryption  secure login pages  and user authentication requirements are examples of how manufacturers integrate security capabilities into their products  these security features in the product s design often require hospitals to take action to activate them and maintain their viability consider the example of product access control  typically  a device manufacturer or software provider can implement access controls in product functionalities by verifying or authenticating the identity of a clinical user  looking at a hospital s active directory service and utilizing necessary passwords and protocols can determine if the user belongs to a group the product recognizes through its configuration only the healthcare organization can identify which users are authorized to access the system and configure the product appropriately  using an inappropriate group  allowing too many users  or being lax about maintaining an up to date directory can open a network to unnecessary risk even mobile and cloud based applications require shared responsibility  hospitals must ensure that browsers and mobile devices are up to date with security features enabled to optimize the manufacturer s cloud based security controls  such as multifactor authentication therefore  to facilitate secure product implementation  medical equipment manufacturers must embed security controls using proven algorithms and designs guided by the security by design process  at the same time  hospitals have their own share of responsibilities and activities to ensure the product is used securely with different products available throughout their facilities  it can be difficult for it leaders to know how to proceed  for security measures to be successful  hospitals and manufacturers must collaborate to determine what will best meet the hospital s needs  every hospital has processes and procedures to secure its it infrastructure  which extend to all products within a system before a hospital deploys a device  its manufacturer must be transparent about the security features that the hospital can use  as well as their expectations of the hospital environment  hospitals  in turn  should educate themselves about those security features and determine if they meet their expectations how do hospitals know their role manufacturers usually make it easy for hospitals to understand how to optimize medical data security  they often provide clinical users and system administrators with information and guidelines such as the manufacturer disclosure statement for medical device security  mds2   software bills of materials  sboms   hardening guides  and other security guidance materials these documents provide step by step blueprints for healthcare providers to follow to do their part to protect medical device data from intrusion  recommended steps may include restricting login access to specific personnel  securing connections between systems using network segmentation and restricted ports  using trusted certificates to verify the identity of medical devices and clinical data receiving systems  and other actions specific to the hospital s network read manufacturers  recommended security guidelinesmanufacturers  product documentation and guides tell hospitals how to leverage a medical device or software s embedded security features for optimal use  it s important to review these guides every time a new version of a product or software is deployed because enhanced security controls may require additional measures  such as updated encryption configurations or new private keys it s also not uncommon for some security controls  such as systems access needs or password requirements  to degrade over time as clinical users make configuration or access changes  use these guides regularly to control the effectiveness of the current security configuration cybercriminals only need one weak spot to infiltrate a network for nefarious purposes  to thwart their activity  manufacturers and hospitals need to team up and be clear about each other s roles and shared responsibilities in an end to end

123,the use of qr codes to deliver malicious payloads jumped in q4 2023  especially against executives  who saw 42 times more qr code phishing than the average employee february 8  2024email attacks relying on qr codes surged in the last quarter  with attackers specifically targeting corporate executives and managers  reinforcing recommendations that companies place additional digital protections around their business leadership making matters worse  phishing emails using qr codes  aka  quishing   can often get by spam filters  with attacks targeting users of microsoft 365 and docusign successfully landing in email inboxes  according to a report published this week by abnormal security  a provider of cloud email security in the fourth quarter of 2023  the average top executive in the c suite saw 42 times more phishing attacks using qr codes compared to the average employee  other managerial roles suffered an increase in attacks as well  although significantly smaller  with these non c suite executives encountering five times more qr code based phishing attacks  according to the company s report overall  the data demonstrates that attackers have executives — and other privileged users — in their sites  says mike britton  ciso for abnormal security  if i m an attacker  i want to attack the people that have the ability for me to get paid and have credentials that give me access to the most interesting information   he says   or i want to pretend to be those people  because once again  social engineering requires that trust   for a victim to think   hey  this vp of sales or this vp of hr is asking me to do something   making them  typically more likely     to take action  while qr codes have been around for three decades  they became much more popular during the pandemic  as restaurants and other businesses directed customers to contact free and online ordering  in a business context  a top use case for qr codes is offering links to ease the sign up process for multifactor authentication  mfa   cyberattackers have hopped on  more than a quarter of qr code attacks  27   in q4 were fake notices of mfa  for example  while about one in five attacks  21   were fake notifications about a shared document  according to abnormal security s report top executives see 42 times more attacks using qr codes than regular employees  source  abnormal securitybecause attackers hide their phishing link in an image  qr code phishing bypasses user suspicions and some email security products  in addition  malicious qr codes can be placed in physical spaces using a simple sticker  bypassing digital security altogether  attacks exploit users  inherent trust in qr codes  embedding them in everyday items like parking meters or posters   says monique becenti  director of product at mobile security firm zimperium   the success rate of phishing with qr codes will surpass traditional phishing methods because they often bypass users  typical suspicion triggers  such as typos in the url  leading to a higher likelihood of scanning them  yet another way to steal exec s credentialsfor the most part  quishing attackers who focus on executives are after the credentials — usernames and passwords — of privileged users  credential phishing is the most popular form of email attack  accounting for 73  of all attacks through the vector and 84  of attacks using a qr code  and they often lead to more significant compromises  says abnormal security s britton  the primary goal is getting at a user to steal their credentials   he says   once i have your credentials  i can do a lot more damage  and i can do a lot of lasting damage  if i have your credentials  i can log into your account  i can see who you ve sent emails to  i can send emails pretending to be you  and i can create mail filter rules  that last point is a common way to abuse mail credentials  britton says  the attacker will create a blind carbon copy  bcc  rule that forwards all emails to the attacker s account further   threat actors also recognize that often multiple people have access to an executive s inbox  such as executive assistants   the report stated   consequently  every individual who knows the login credentials for a vip s inbox represents a potential entry point that can be exploited by an attacker  thwarting quishing takes technology   training the humanthe good news is  since october  qr code phishing has subsided to a large degree  after accounting for 22  of phishing attacks  according to human risk management firm hoxhunt   since last october  we ve seen evidence that email filters are catching up to the qr phishing technique   says jon gellin  threat team lead at hoxhunt   as fewer of these attacks are bypassing email filters  there s been a resultant decrease in their popularity  however  even if quishing subsides  it will remain a tool for attackers  much in the way that shortened urls and image spam continue to be used in cyberattacks  the best way to protect users is to train them  gellin says  about 5  of users respond to a phishing attack within the first few minutes  suggesting that a well trained pool of employees can help blunt an attack  as the qr phishing trend has shown  some threats will always slip past even the most sophisticated filters   he says   at that point  it s up to the human layer to have the skills and tools to deal with the threat effectively  training is important  but because a single failure can have a significant impact  technical controls are necessary  says abnormal security s britton  there  there are some phishing attacks that i ve seen that even i have to get a second opinion from people because they look so real   he says   how do i expect an hr person to get that right every time  how do i expect an accounts payable person  how do i expect a financial analyst   training is important  but we re going to fail  and it only takes one failure   he says about

as posturing from the islamic republic has turned into more serious cyberattacks against the us  albania  and more february 8  2024iran s cyber conflict with israel has reached global proportions  with cyberattacks against businesses and government agencies on other continents causing arguably as much ruckus as those in israel itself it s a classic case of cyber imitating life  while us military bases and international shipping routes are peppered by its proxy terrorist outfits — most notably  the dernier cri houthis — iran s cyber threat cloud has been spreading its attacks into the us and europe  against targets perceived to be aligned with its bête noire in a report published this week  microsoft characterized this global proliferation as a  phase 3  in iran s hebraic cyber offensive  this is highly likely to be part of the iranian government s strategic pressure campaign   says a threat intelligence analyst from recorded future s insikt group  who chose not to be named for this story   tehran is hoping to influence governments directly and not  get  directly involved in the conflict via the ability to impact economies  they are highly likely aiming to influence business communities to pressure their governments to support a cessation of israeli military activities in the gaza strip  among the latest victims of this phase 3 pressure offensive  an albanian government organization and iran s military guard itself the latest in iran s global cyber offensivethe most recent known case occurred on feb  1  albania s institute of statistics  instat  disclosed on facebook that a cyberattack  which aimed to damage instat s data has caused the internet services of the official website and email to be interrupted  in an official statement  the country s national authority for electronic certification and cyber security  akcesk  clarified that the affected instate systems  are not currently classified as critical or important information infrastructure  on telegram  the iranian apt commonly known as  homeland justice  told a somewhat different story  claiming the attack for itself  it described the event as more extortion than denial of service  dos   with more than 100 terabytes of population and geographic information system data copied and then deleted from the organization s servers as microsoft noted in its report  homeland justice has previously targeted albania  alongside other countries perceived to be in support of israel  in a series of telegram posts  the group framed the stolen data in the wider context of albania

intel at tidal cyber   this could provide limited deterrence against future attacks  but we also know iranian cyber actors are persistently intent on attacking us based targets  especially government entities  though it might at first seem short sighted for iran to unnecessarily drag the us into a cyber conflict  the insikt analyst suggests that it could be a well calculated risk  iran has been trying to de escalate a kinetic tit for tat to minimize the risk of us retaliation against its territory  it is possible more aggressive and more global cyber operations will allow them to mitigate that risk while still contributing to the anti israel agenda   they suggest the three phases of the conflictaccording to microsoft  iran s pseudo cyber war against israel can be split into three distinct phases phase 1  during the initial days following the oct  7 hamas terrorist attack  was rather amateurish  the report claims  iran nexus groups performed light opportunistic attacks  leveraged pre existing access to claim attacks against israeli organizations  and repackaged old and publicly available data as new  leaks  phase 2  beginning in mid to late october  ratcheted up the volume  the number of groups working actively against israel rose from nine to at least fourteen  iran conducted ten cyber enabled influence operations in that month alone  alongside more coordinated and destructive campaigns  still  much of the winnings from its most successful campaigns were overstated in phase 3 the attacks have become even more honed  utilizing more advanced tactics  techniques  and procedures  ttps   targeting more significant businesses and critical infrastructure operators  and weaving in more effective messaging aimed at undermining israeli morale and pressuring israel s allies  this concern will only increase heading further into election season  since we know iran has regularly sought to interfere with past us votes   small warns if recent months are anything to go by  we won t know until it happens what the next iranian cyberattack will look like  recent cases demonstrate that the whole range of attack methods are considered fair game for these cyber operations  including web app exploits  credential harvesting  and even ransomware and cryptomining  this creates a wide range for potential disruptions to critical operations  plus potential fuel for influence operations whether or not the attacks cause notable material impact   small says read more about dr global middle east   africaabout the author s you may also

each nation has its own overarching threat behaviors and agenda to meet its ruling government s ambitions on the world stage  russia s cyber threat activities are primarily focused on offensive cyber operations  china s are focused on cyber espionage  iran s on influence operations  and north korea s on financial gain events of the 20th century  developments since the dawn of the millennium  and the intense geopolitics since the start of 2022 have contributed to recent actions taken by the big four  industry analysts see plenty of evidence to link cybersecurity offenses around the globe to nation state sponsored groups associated with these four countries russiaa multitude of geopolitical factors have influenced russia s actions in recent years  including nato s expansion east across europe to russia s borders and nato s support for ukraine russia is forming greater economic and military partnerships with china  iran  and north korea to boost its economy and resupply its military hardware  after europe closed its door to russian oil  the country had to sell its natural resources to developing asian markets  as a result  india imported 40  of discounted oil from russia in 2023  up from just 3  two years earlier  strong economic dependencies often produce an uptick in cyber espionage operations due to the need for foreign policy information surrounding these deals as russia is engaged in open warfare  the state has conducted a growing number of overt attacks  reports indicate that 16 different  families  of wiper malware have been used against ukraine over the past 12 months  up from just one instance in the previous two years  eset senior researcher anton cherepanov stated   this is the most intense use of wipers in all computer history  notably  the united states  germany  and the united kingdom are the world s top donors of ukrainian military aid and are also the most targeted nations outside of ukraine chinain 2023  china emerged as the world s second great power  with extensive ambitions to further its influence by way of global infrastructure investment through the belt and road initiative and political domination of east asia  china is assessed to be the most advanced threat nation in terms of both cyberattacks and cyber espionage capabilities  its strategic interests reside in preserving the existence and legitimacy of the chinese communist party  ccp  by reunification with taiwan protecting china s national interests  including expansion of its territorial claims in the south china sea asserting china s power globally these strategic interests are realized in several key areas  first  in 2015  china announced its made in china 2025 plan  which aims to advance china s manufacturing base by rapidly developing 10 high tech industries  if china can create advanced semiconductors  the taiwanese monopoly on semiconductor manufacturing will be severely undermined and thus one of the main deterrents for a possible chinese invasion will be removed china also aims to emerge on the world stage as a hard counter to western  and particularly us  dominance  as former us cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency  cisa  director gen  keith alexander said  china is undertaking  the greatest transfer of intellectual wealth in history  iraniran s modern political landscape began in 1979 with the toppling of the monarchy and the accession of the religious based islamic republic  since then  iran has cemented itself as a strong state with great influence in the middle east iran s cyber characteristics fall into two categories  offensive operations and actions to exert influence to bolster the government  since june 2022  multiple iranian threat groups have deployed cyber enabled influence operations  io   this combines offensive operations with messaging in a coordinated and manipulative fashion to further iran s geopolitical objectives by shifting perceptions  behaviors  and decisions towards the regime in addition  tensions have been significantly high with israel  leading to economic and covert military support to hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian areas in 2022  iran s cyber capabilities were considered the most basic of the big four  however  in 2023  iranian state actors used increasingly sophisticated tradecraft  rolling out a larger number of custom implants and becoming much faster at exploiting the latest exploits  these demonstrate a clear jump in iranian cyber capabilities north koreaa state of war has technically existed between north korea and south korea since 1950  the countries never signed a peace deal in the korean war  only a ceasefire agreement  the north korean leadership sees the state s and the kim regime s survival as under direct threat from the united states and its allies  to shield itself from the perceived threat of imminent invasion  the kim government has built a deterrent by aiming thousands of artillery pieces at south korea s capital  seoul  and by developing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles this aggressive tactic has led to strict economic sanctions  inhibiting the outside world from trading with north korea  in response  the state has conducted numerous financially motivated attacks and crypto heists to steal money to prop up the government and fund weapons  it also runs intellectual property theft operations  the united states is by far the most targeted nation  accounting for over 40  of targeting over the past 12 months  second and third are south korea and japan respectively what lies ahead

126,february 9  2024recent events  including an artificial intelligence  ai  generated deepfake robocall impersonating president biden urging new hampshire voters to abstain from the primary  serve as a stark reminder that malicious actors increasingly view modern generative ai  genai  platforms as a potent weapon for targeting us elections platforms like chatgpt  google s gemini  formerly bard   or any number of purpose built dark web large language models  llms  could play a role in disrupting the democratic process  with attacks encompassing mass influence campaigns  automated trolling  and the proliferation of deepfake content in fact  fbi director christopher wray recently voiced concerns about ongoing information warfare using deepfakes that could sow disinformation during the upcoming presidential campaign  as state backed actors attempt to sway geopolitical balances genai could also automate the rise of  coordinated inauthentic behavior  networks that attempt to develop audiences for their disinformation campaigns through fake news outlets  convincing social media profiles  and other avenues — with the goal of sowing discord and undermining public trust in the electoral process election influence  substantial risks   nightmare scenariosfrom the perspective of padraic o reilly  chief innovation officer for cybersaint  the risk is  substantial  because the technology is evolving so quickly  it promises to be interesting and perhaps a bit alarming  too  as we see new variants of disinformation leveraging deepfake technology   he says specifically  o reilly says  the  nightmare scenario  is that microtargeting with ai generated content will proliferate on social media platforms  that s a familiar tactic from the cambridge analytica scandal  where the company amassed psychological profile data on 230 million us voters  in order to serve up highly tailored messaging via facebook to individuals in an attempt to influence their beliefs — and votes  but genai could automate that process at scale  and create highly convincing content that would have few  if any   bot  characteristics that could turn people off  stolen targeting data  personality snapshots of who a user is and their interests  merged with ai generated content is a real risk   he explains   the russian disinformation campaigns of 2013–2017 are suggestive of what else could and will occur  and we know of deepfakes generated by us citizens  like the one  featuring biden  and elizabeth warren  the mix of social media and readily available deepfake tech could be a doomsday weapon for polarization of us citizens in an already deeply divided country  he adds  democracy is predicated upon certain shared traditions and information  and the danger here is increased balkanization among citizens  leading to what the stanford researcher renée diresta called  bespoke realities    o reilly says  aka people believing in  alternative facts  the platforms that threat actors use to sow division will likely be of little help  he adds that  for instance  the social media platform x  formerly known as twitter  has gutted its quality assurance  qa  on content  the other platforms have provided boilerplate assurances that they will address disinformation  but free speech protections and lack of regulation still leave the field wide open for bad actors   he cautions ai amplifies existing phishing ttpsgenai is already being used to craft more believable  targeted phishing campaigns at scale — but in the context of election security that phenomenon is event more concerning  according to scott small  director of cyber threat intelligence at tidal cyber  we expect to see cyber adversaries adopting generative ai to make phishing and social engineering attacks — the leading forms of election related attacks in terms of consistent volume over many years — more convincing  making it more likely that targets will interact with malicious content   he explains small says ai adoption also lowers the barrier to entry for launching such attacks  a factor that is likely to increase the volume of campaigns this year that try to infiltrate campaigns or take over candidate accounts for impersonation purposes  among other potentials  criminal and nation state adversaries regularly adapt phishing and social engineering lures to current events and

election officials and candidates are constantly giving interviews and press conferences that threat actors can pull sound bites from for ai based deepfakes   says james turgal  vice president of

attempts  this is so important — especially with volunteers — because not everyone has good cyber hygiene   turgal says additionally  campaign and election volunteers must be trained on how to safely provide information online and to outside entities  including social media posts  and use caution when doing so  cyber threat actors can gather this information to tailor socially engineered lures to

127,february 8  2024commentaryartificial intelligence  ai   since the invention of the operating system  we haven t seen a technology poised to have such far reaching impact on the way we work and live  and organizations are keen to get in on the action  in fact  according to a recent study by avanade  in which we surveyed more than 3 000 business and it executives globally  92  of respondents agree that their organization needs to shift to an ai first operating model this year to stay competitive but rather than shifts  i see sprints  many organizations are reacting to the hype  rushing to satisfy board curiosity and deploying ai somewhere  anywhere  to check a box  they re often jumping ahead of the important and tough work of finding the right problem for the technology  be it a new revenue stream  higher profitability  process optimization  or cost savings   understanding their ai readiness  and designing a road map that matches it the technology industry at large has some important but tough work ahead  too  ensuring that we re leading by example and designing and applying ai responsibly  after all  just because we can use ai for everything doesn t mean that we should closing the gap  mitigating bias  and moreso  as we all absorb the mania we were exposed to in 2023  i recommend that individuals  organizations  and the overall technology industry focus on these five priorities in 2024 closing the gap between ai advancements and government regulations  although the united states government and the european union announced policies around the use of ai  we re still living with a wild west type framework  advancements in the application of ai will require access to tons of data  and this will clash with privacy concerns  and yet we must address how to maintain privacy in a way that still allows innovation to happen  i believe there s a huge opportunity for technology firms to do what matters and come forward to invest in privacy preserving technologies mitigating bias and ensuring ethical use  mitigating bias in ai is essential for fairness and equality  as biased systems can perpetuate social inequalities  accurate and reliable outcomes depend on unbiased ai  especially in critical applications like law enforcement and hiring  public trust in ai technology hinges on its perceived fairness and lack of bias  legal and regulatory compliance as ai governance evolves mandates vigilance against bias  i believe that ethical ai practice is crucial for a company s reputation and commercial success  reflecting a commitment to global and cultural sensitivity strengthening explainability  closely tied to ethical use is that ai and everything surrounding it must be explainable  auditable  and defensible  technology professionals must be able to tell the story of how the data is calculated  linked  and transformed to those who are asked to sign off on projects and budgets  stakeholders will be wary of what they don t understand and what doesn t seem transparent  especially around fairness and bias developing ai talent  what expertise do you need to be a practitioner of ai  yes  deep programming skills and a solid foundation in mathematics are table stakes  but gone are the days when you can throw something to a programmer in the corner who doesn t interact with people  an ai specialist needs to possess soft skills and collaborative capabilities  they ll be working with legal  finance  marketing  and human resources  and they must communicate in an effective and straightforward way embedding ai across the business responsibly  ai is a strategic business capability that can and should impact all parts of an organization  and it s going to foster collaboration like you ve never seen  you must therefore have a business strategy for its use  assess the readiness of your people  processes  and platforms  and put a framework in place for its responsible use  this is a critical component of understanding and managing risk tolerance  being compliant  and most importantly  building confidence and trust in ai technologies as the hype of last year settles  ai s transformative potential is there for the taking in 2024  if we can get these five priorities right  let s get to work about the author s you may also likedevsecops  the smart way to shift leftfeb 14  2024making sense of

130,fbi  give us warrantless section 702 snooping powers – or china winsnever mind the court orders obtained to thwart volt typhoon botnetanalysis the fbi s latest pr salvo  as it fights to preserve its warrantless snooping powers on americans via fisa section 702  is more big talk of cyberattacks by the chinese government during a us house subcommittee meeting last week on cyber threats from beijing  fbi boss christopher wray told lawmakers that  702 is the greatest tool the fbi has to combat prc hacking groups   prc being people s republic of china wray cited an example he s used previously about how  last year  section 702 of america s foreign intelligence surveillance act allowed the fbi to observe chinese government snoops trying to break into an unnamed us transportation hub and take action  we were able to quickly notify the entity and share technical details  which enabled them to be able to kick the chinese off the networks before harm could be done — before some of the more apocalyptic scenarios we ve been talking about here could transpire   wray told the house select committee hearing on competition with china section 702 is a contentious amendment to fisa that is supposed to allow us intelligence agencies to spy on foreign intelligence targets located overseas  in reality  the private communications of some us persons may be warrantlessly swept up in these section 702 dragnets and analyzed by agents  which alarms privacy campaigners failure to reauthorize section 702     would be a form of unilateral disarmament in the face of the chinese communist partythe amendment is due to expire by april 19 this year unless congress votes to reauthorize it  lawmakers have the option of tweaking the rules so that  for instance  warrants are required in certain circumstances or some other protections are put in place  the feds aren t a fan of some of the changes to 702 right now under consideration  as they argue things like warrant requirements for all those queries they run each month will slow down and hamper investigations  failure to reauthorize section 702  or for that matter  reauthorizing it in a way that severely restricted our ability to use it  would be a form of unilateral disarmament in the face of the chinese communist party   wray continued   i can assure the american people  the chinese government is not tying its hands behind its back  it s going the other direction  and we need to do the same  at yesterday s press briefing on china s volt typhoon crew infiltrating us critical infrastructure facilities  it networks  cynthia kaiser  deputy assistant director for the fbi s cybersecurity division  revealed her agents  using spying powers granted under section 702   also identified other chinese state cyber actors  breaking into vital american systems  and in fact  we only know about many critical infrastructure entities compromised by the chinese  because of fbi fisa 702 collections   she added later on the call  when asked if section 702 was used in the fbi s operation to remotely kill volt typhoon s kv botnet  kaiser said she couldn t get into specifics   but i want to end by noting how critical 702 is to all of our operations  especially within cyberspace  we don t know all of the details  and don t have a seat in the war room where the fbi and other us agencies fight nation state snoops on the regular but we do know  specific to the volt typhoon takedown  the fbi obtained warrants that allowed it to remotely search us based routers that had been infected with backdoor malware by china  the feds wanted to hunt for information about beijing s espionage efforts before wiping that malicious code from the compromised devices keyword here being  warrants   it is possible for the fbi to get court orders to conduct searches on remote equipment and perform other special operations  and it has done so many times in the past  the feds draw the line at having to get a warrant for each and every query they run that may involve a us citizen  resident  or organization  it seems motivationwithin the fisa section 702 debate  the fbi is fighting to retain its powers to conduct  without a warrant  surveillance that may accidentally or otherwise vacuum up us persons  data – powers that have been abused millions of times by the fbi  the feds last year said auditors determined fbi agents had achieved a 96 percent compliance rate for fisa queries drilling deeper  fisa section 702 allows the fbi and its fellow federal organizations to monitor foreigners  electronic communications beyond america s borders  but if these emails  texts  and phone calls are with or about us persons  those individuals and organizations  data can get pulled in as well for analysis  along with anyone those us persons also talked to it s a wide net  and this has led to extreme cases of misuse — especially from the fbi  which has used 702 powers to conduct warrantless surveillance on us citizens including protesters  political campaign donors  and elected officials including a us senator in terms of cyber value  we ve seen little evidence of queries providing valuebecause of these abuses  and  you know  the constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures  there s been a big push to reform section 702 and require all us intelligence agencies to obtain a warrant before conducting a us person query currently  there are four bills in congress to reauthorize section 702  but only two of them  the protect liberty and end warrantless surveillance act  aka the protect liberty act  and the even broader reaching government surveillance reform act of 2023  include a warrant requirement  in terms of cyber value  we ve seen little evidence of queries providing value  and in cases where it has  the protect liberty act s exceptions for queries with consent  which critical infrastructure being targeted would certainly provide   queries focused on malware code  and metadata queries  which can map out unusual network traffic and intrusion attempts  mean that proposed reforms wouldn t inhibit operations   jake laperruque  deputy director of the center for democracy and technology s security and surveillance project  told the register  the bottom line is the fisa 702 debate isn t about whether the authority is valuable  it s whether reforms unduly interfere with that value   he added   the answer is a resounding no    volt typhoon not the only chinese crew lurking in us energy  critical networks  congress told how chinese goons plan to incite  societal chaos  in the us  four more months of section 702 snooping slipped into  890b us defense budget bill  as nsa buys up americans  browser records  uncle sam is asked to simply knock it offstill  arguing the feds can t fight terrorism and other serious crimes perpetrated by foreign governments without warrantless searches of americans seems like a shell game at best  especially in light of the fbi s volt typhoon disruption  which involved court issued search warrants  i think this is the same issue that has come up again and again in the government s rhetoric   kia hamadanchy  senior policy counsel at the aclu  told the register  they continue to speak to what they view as the overall value of section 702 surveillance without making the case as to why this necessitates violating the constitutional rights of americans  and i think it continues to be a disingenuous argument when it comes to cyberthreats from china  one week it s needed to combat fentanyl  the next it s international polluters  or cyberthreats from chinaother organizations also advocating for reining in government snooping powers agree with this assessment  remember the old television serials in which the antagonists often were monsters of the week  villains who d show up for one episode to be vanquished by the heroes just in time for them to face a new monster in the next episode   electronic frontier foundation senior policy analyst matthew guariglia said this  he said  sounds an awful lot like uncle sam s strategy to convince the public of the need to renew section 702  one week it s needed to combat fentanyl  the next it s international polluters  or cyberthreats from china  or russia   he told the register  maybe the feds are just that busy ultimately  this surveillance tool  intended to be used overseas for national security reasons   has morphed into an invasive domestic spying program which

drafted into a network that crooks use to distribute malware  serve phishing pages  and share other dodgy stuff  according to researchers this mesh of compromised sites is known as vextrio  and has been mostly flying under the radar since its inception in 2017 or earlier  though lately more details about the operation have emerged the process is simple  and mirrors the traffic distribution systems  or tdses  that the marketing world uses to direct netizens to particular sites based on their interests or similar in the case of vextrio  tens of thousands of websites are compromised so that their visitors are redirected to pages that serve up malware downloads  show fake login pages to steal credentials  or perform some other fraud or cyber crime it s said at least 60 affiliates are involved in the network in some way  some partners provide the compromised websites  which send marks to vextrio s own tds infrastructure  which in turn directs those victims  browsers to harmful pages  the tds typically only redirects people if they meet certain criteria vextrio takes a fee from the crooks running the fraudulent sites for directing web traffic their way  and the miscreants who provided the compromised websites in the first place get a cut  we re told the tds also sends netizens to scam websites operated by the vextrio crew itself  allowing the criminals to profit directly from their fraud in its january global threat index  check point on friday labeled vextrio a  considerable  security risk  citing its reach and sophisticated setup  vextrio is yet another

135,fortinet s week to forget  critical vulns  disclosure screw ups  and that toothbrush ddos attack claiman orchestra of fails for the security vendorwe ve had to write the word  fortinet  so often lately that we re considering making a macro just to make our lives a little easier after what the company s reps will surely agree has been a week sent from hell it all culminated this friday with the disclosure of yet another critical security vulnerability in fortios  impacting its ssl vpn tracked as cve 24 21762  the 9 6 severity out of bounds write issue allows for remote unauthenticated attackers to achieve code execution  there s also evidence to suggest it s already been exploited as a zero day security researchers have urged users to patch vulnerable vpns as soon as possible since the vulnerability is understood to be easily exploitable there are various different affected versions of fortios and different patches available  the vulnerability also impacts unsupported versions  so now is definitely the time to make that upgrade if fortios 6 0 x is still running  version affected solution fortios 7 6 not affected not applicable fortios 7 4 7 4 0 through 7 4 2 upgrade to 7 4 3

mitigate the vulnerability  it said other vulnerabilities were also disclosed alongside it  such as cve 2024 23113 – a critical rce bug in fortios fgfmd daemon  but these haven t been exploited in the wild buggy bug disclosure and an angry kettlesome of you reg readers will have been following the fortinet related coverage this week and perused the story about a confusing double bug disclosure on february 6  this was just the start of hell week the story immediately attracted our attention since it s not too often we hear about two maximum severity bugs being disclosed on the same day  impacting a major security product like fortisiem however  that s what happened on tuesday with both cve 2024 23108 and cve 2024 23109 appearing in the national vulnerability database  nvd   the confusing part was that both vulnerabilities were submitted by fortinet  but both linked back to a separate  earlier october advisory  revealing no details about these seemingly huge new flaws so  hungry vultures we are  we swooped down and picked that story up immediately  shooting fortinet a request for clarity on the matter and why it hadn t published details on them many readers will likely have seen that story since it was among the most read for a few days  but some may be wondering why we didn t update it with the latest available information per our usual high standards it took fortinet more than 73 hours to issue us with an official response  it came through after we started writing this on february 9 for those not in tune with how the media works  this is very  very poor form on the vendor s part  a response given to a publication even beyond just 24 hours  especially with no explanation as regards the delay  is considered unprofessional in the meantime  the company has issued two separate statements to our competitors explaining what exactly has gone wrong with this disclosure  we didn t publish this for a number of editorial related reasons  and prior to the statement issued today  we ve only received apologies for the radio silence  not even copies of the statements given to other publications if a 24 hour wait is considered unprofessional  more than three days is a slap in the face so  all of that is why our coverage hasn t been as timely as we  and you as readers  expect from us but  since we re providing an overview of the vendor s week  what actually happened here was that it absolutely bungled the disclosure of these vulnerabilities firstly  fortinet backtracked and said these weren t vulnerabilities at all  instead explaining that they were issued in error and were duplicates of the single vulnerability mentioned in the aforementioned october advisory – cve 2023 34992 then  within hours of this  the company backtracked again saying that yes  actually  these are two new vulnerabilities – two bypasses for october s cve 2023 34992  this came after the researcher credited with the discoveries published the email from fortinet confirming the findings were indeed actual vulnerabilities  fortinet retained its 10 10 severity ratings  while the nvd downgraded both to 9 8 fortinet s statement from today addressed the  why  behind the disclosure  blaming it on  exceptional circumstances  according to a fortinet spokesperson timely and ongoing communications with our customers is a key component in our efforts to help protect and secure their organization  fortinet psirt policy diligently balances our commitment to the security of our customers and our culture of researcher collaboration and transparency there are instances where confidential advance customer communications can include early warning on advisories to enable customers to further strengthen their security posture  prior to the advisory being publicly released to a broader audience  this process follows best practices for responsible disclosure to provide our customers timely information to help them make informed decisions due to exceptional circumstances that include the premature dissemination of mitigation guidance and in an effort to help protect our customers  fortinet distributed its monthly advisory on february 8 ahead of its anticipated february 13 publication date to provide important details to customers considering these circumstances  for more on fortinet s responsible disclosure process  visit the fortinet product security incident response team  psirt  that damned toothbrush storysecurity minded readers or otherwise  you will all have surely seen the story circulating this week about java based  malware laden toothbrushes being recruited in a 3 million strong botnet that s ddos ing switzerland unlike many major national newspapers  and even some well read tech press  we brushed over this one as something didn t quite seem right about it  for fortinet  it was yet another mess to clean up the swiss newspaper that originally published the story claimed a director of systems engineering at  you can guess the company  told their reporter during an interview that the toothbrush ddos ing was actually happening in the real world after many strongly worded suspicions that the claim was false  and a litany of memes pasted over tech social media  fortinet responded by saying the claim was simply just lost in translation and that there was no actual massive toothbrush botnet  it was just a hypothetical situation the writer at the swiss german daily who first reported the story snapped back  disputing fortinet s response  saying   what the fortinet headquarters in california is now calling a  translation problem  sounded completely different during the research  swiss fortinet representatives described the toothbrush case as a real ddos at a meeting that discussed current threats  stefan zuger  the fortinet engineer who gave the interview  provided specific details of the ddos incident  including for how long the attack had been ongoing and the potential damage to the unnamed website it affected  the reporter claimed the swiss journo also said the article was proofread by fortinet before publication and nothing in the report was corrected by the vendor tgif  right the weekend will doubtless be a welcome reprieve  especially for members of fortinet s publicity team who will have been working tirelessly to undo all the company wide errors from the past week to their credit  they will also be dealing with the response to the reports that were also published this week about chinese cyberspies exploiting fortigate vulnerabilities using custom malware we at el

others  failure to comply with these regulations can result in severe consequences  including fines and reputational damage   shared responsibility model  another critical aspect is the shared responsibility model inherent in cloud computing  this model in cloud computing means that cloud service providers are responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure  while businesses are responsible for securing their data and applications  while cloud providers can also handle business data and applications  organizations must still possess a comprehensive understanding of their responsibilities  implementing security measures to safeguard their assets   multi cloud environments  embracing multi cloud environments introduces new challenges from the integration and interoperability between different cloud providers  these challenges include complexities from managing multiple configurations and access controls  security patching gaps  navigating diverse regulatory frameworks  and inconsistent security visibility across multiple platforms  this challenge requires a focused approach to address varied security needs within the multi cloud landscape   expanded attack surface  as it resources extend across multiple cloud and on premises environments  the risk and potential of cyberattacks increase significantly  the obligation to secure virtual servers  remote applications  containers  and network interactions between environments accompanies the presence in the cloud in addition to the challenges discussed  organizations must address other challenges like lack of knowledge and expertise  reliability and availability  cost management  and password security  each of these challenges requires careful consideration and strategic planning to

the importation  sale and use of consumer hacking devices  like flippers  used to commit these crimes  champagne s announcement comes after a national summit on combatting auto theft hosted this week by the government of canada in ottawa  ontario according to the canadian government  around 90 000 vehicles  or one car every six minutes  are reported stolen every year  with car theft resulting in  1 billion in annual losses  including insurance costs for fixing and replacing stolen cars the figures shared by the canadian government when describing the car theft surge currently impacting canada align with the most recent data shared by the statistics canada government agency  which shows an increasing number of car theft reports since 2021 canadian police also reported that motor vehicle theft had the most significant impact on an increase in the national crime severity index in 2022 the canadian government s innovation  science and economic development  ised  department  and the

146,by 2025  britain is set to ditch physical immigration status documents such as biometric residence permits  brps  and biometric residence cards  brcs  in a bid to make its borders digital  which is in line with developed countries like australia understand what the new home office development means for existing brp and brc holders  and what you need to do e visas to replace biometric residence cardspresently  students  workers  immigrants and their dependents from non eu countries residing in the uk are eventually issued biometric residence permits  brps   cards which are proof of their immigration status in the country  much like e passports  these plastic cards contain a chip that can be used by a border force officer to cryptographically verify the authenticity of the document itself and a person s identity via biometrics  facial photograph and fingerprints  stored in that chip some developed nations such as australia  much like the uk  also collect biometrics from immigrants but in contrast  do not issue physical cards or in passport vignettes  physical visa stickers and stamps   instead  applicants are granted an e visa that can be verified online and serves a digital proof of their immigration status all uk brps issued up until today are set to expire december 31  2024—even if your immigration status is valid beyond that date  or has no time limit on it  i e  permanent residents with an  indefinite leave to remain    the reason for this being  while the uk was a part of the european union  eu   regulations required the government to implement next generation encryption technology into its immigration documents  and as such the uk planned on rolling out enhanced cards after the end of this year  while phasing existing ones out since post brexit  however  eu requirements no longer apply to the uk and the home office has decided to discontinue brps altogether by 2025  you will not need a brp from 1 january 2025  you ll be able to prove your immigration status online  without a brp   reads a webpage on the gov uk website   uk visas   immigration  ukvi   will update their information on how to prove your immigration status in early 2024  you do not need to do anything and your immigration status will not be affected  advantages and disadvantagesan evisa is an electronic record of a person s immigration status and provides customers with the ability to view and prove their immigration status digitally  explains home office  it removes the need for physical documents such as  the biometric residence permit  brp   ink stamps and visa vignette stickers in a customer s passport or the biometric residence card  brc  this also saves an applicant the inconvenience associated with submitting their physical passport to a consulate for visa issuance  waiting for weeks  and subsequently arranging its collection despite their drawbacks  a key advantage of physical documents  especially chip based ones  is their ability to be reliably verified offline  given the basics of public key encryption  when combined with security features such as uv holograms and watermarks built into these documents  the dependence on an always online system is practically eliminated in other words  one can even use an nfc powered smartphone app to securely read and verify the authenticity of a brp card  or an epassport  without being connected to the internet  the card holder s personal details and photograph—all digitally signed by the issuing government  are stored in the chip itself  despite this  passengers have faced chaos at airports in the past when egates went down what happens should the internet connected it systems used by the airlines and border officials face an outage  in such a case  how can the identity of arriving passengers with evisas  as opposed to physical biometric documents  be reliably verified what will the new process look like because we are already in february  those with brp cards expiring over the next few months may be wondering what they need to do bleepingcomputer reached out to the home office to better understand the upcoming changes and what will the new process to prove and renew immigration status look like  evisas provide secure confirmation of someone s uk immigration status and make it easier for those who need to check status  such as employers and landlords  via online services   a home office spokesperson told bleepingcomputer  replacing physical immigration documents with evisas by 2025 is a key part of the transformation and digitisation of the border and immigration system  delivering enhanced security and cost savings for the uk public and greater convenience for customers and status checkers  ukvi accounts to open for allour understanding is that the physical biometric cards and printed visa stickers will entirely be replaced by e visas  similar to the ones issued by australia  where immigrants currently use the visa entitlement verification online  vevo  system to prove their status digitally similarly  starting 2025  existing uk brp holders are expected to register for a ukvi online account to view or prove immigration status for a few years now  proving your right to work to an employer  or your right to rent to a landlord has already been a digital process  conducted through the gov uk website by using details from your physical document furthermore  millions of people with an  eu settled status  or those who have used the  uk immigration  id check  app already hold a ukvi account and use e visas to prove their right to enter and live in the uk the upcoming changes are expected to extend these conveniences to nationals of all countries an evisa  much like a physical brp  will be securely linked to its holder s unique biometric information to safeguard against identity fraud immigrants who already have an evisa do not need to do anything while changes are being implemented  but are advised to keep their ukvi account up to date with current personal particulars  including changed contact details or details of a new passport starting this summer  the home office plans on providing airlines  train and ferry operators with integrated secure access to passenger immigration information to enhance border security and reduce unnecessary passenger delays with the move towards e visas  public government bodies like the department for work and pensions  dwp  and the nhs in england and wales will be able to automatically and securely access an individual s status when they apply to access benefits and public services it is important to note  until the new system gets a green light  the process to renew an existing brp or replace a lost one remains the same until the end of this year home office customers including existing brp and physical document holders should monitor  over the next few months for upcoming information on what they need to do and when while the uk government is on track to deliver a digital border and immigration system  including plans to trial contactless entry using just facial recognition  there are no plans at the moment to replace physical passports with digital equivalents

150,introductionthe modern software supply chain represents an ever evolving threat landscape  with each package added to the manifest introducing new attack vectors  to meet industry requirements  organizations must maintain a fast paced development process while staying up to date with the latest security patches  however  in practice  developers often face a large amount of security work without clear prioritization   and miss a significant portion of the attack surface altogether the primary issue arises from the detection and prioritization methods used by traditional static code analysis  sca  tools for vulnerabilities  these methods lack the organizational specific context needed to make an informed scoring decision  the score  even if critical  might not actually be critical for an organization because its infrastructure works in a unique way   affecting the actual impact the vulnerability might have in other words  since these tools depend on a relatively naive methodology to determine a vulnerability s risk  they end up with primarily irrelevant vulnerability scores   making determining which vulnerabilities to address first much harder furthermore  they do not address many supply chain attacks  such as typosquatting  malicious code injection  ci cd attacks  etc  this oversight misleads application security  appsec  teams and developers into focusing on less critical issues  thus delaying the development process and leaving the organization vulnerable to significant attack vectors myrror security develops innovative solutions to these challenges by revolutionizing how organizations detect  prioritize and remediate their supply chain risks  myrror s platform ensures that appsec and engineering teams tackle the right issues at the right time by utilizing binary to source analysis for every third party package in the codebase  unlike traditional sca tools that assess impact using version level detection in manifest files  myrror uses a proprietary reachability vulnerability analysis algorithm  this algorithm identifies which vulnerabilities are actually reachable in production  thus enabling myrror to prioritize security issues accurately this platform review will guide you through the entire myrror user journey  from the initial scm integration to the remediation plan generator  and provide a concise overview of the innovations myrror security has introduced to prevent alert fatigue  empower your organization to work more effectively and protect it from the threats of the modern software supply chain  to get a personalized demo  visit their website here getting started and setupmyrror is designed for easy installation on the organization s existing source code management platform  when myrror is connected to your scm  a discovery process of the organization s dependencies begins  the organization can later select specific repositories for active vulnerability and supply chain attack scanning  providing a prioritized overview of identified risks the discovery sectionthis section enables you to take stock of the supply chain risk associated with your codebase and determine the actual threat landscape you re exposed to from your open source dependencies the repositories tab shows you all the issues in each monitored repository and allows you to choose which to monitor and which to ignore  this will allow you to remove some noise associated with repositories that are not in active use  will soon be deprecated  or are simply irrelevant  this tab serves as the control panel over all of your repositories  it complements the issues screen by pointing you toward your most at risk repositories   allowing for a project  or application level  bird s eye  view of the threats the dependencies tab aggregates every open source dependency in your codebase and creates a graph of all the repositories in which each one is used  this key overview allows you to get a complete picture of the open source libraries your organization relies upon  despite the immense increase in open source repositories in basically every software project  organizations don t have any control over external dependencies  taking inventory of what is being used in your code is the first step to controlling what s happening the myrror dashboardonce the installation is complete and the user chooses the repositories to scan  the myrror dashboard is populated with information about your repositories  their dependencies  and the issues they contain  when the user chooses to monitor additional repositories or connect more scm sources  the dashboard is automatically updated with more information about the new codebases the dashboard provides high level insights into the issues across the entire set of the organization s codebase  including   detection status  issues by category  dependencies with security status  the riskiest repository  issues per code language   status of remediation  out of data dependencies  and morethese charts and graphs generate a detailed and complete overview  providing organizations with clear insights into areas requiring the most work  note the repository filter on the top right   this allows specific teams to get accurate information about their work and the repositories they are in charge of and export only the relevant data for them the issues screenthis is the core of the myrror security platform  here  all your issues are prioritized and flagged according to their actual severity  reachability  and exploitability for a clear understanding of what to tackle next  various parameters are organized into columns  offering more profound insights into each specific issue among these parameters  the reachability column sets myrror apart from traditional sca platforms  it assesses whether the issue is actually reachable in production  which factors into the prioritization   ensuring reachable vulnerabilities can be tackled first but the platform doesn t stop at prioritizing vulnerabilities according to reachability   it also considers whether this is a direct or indirect dependency  whether a fix is available to remediate the issue  and whether an exploit has been confirmed to exist in the wild  all of these parameters help the platform prioritize issues accurately and reliably you can see all the following pieces of information about each vulnerability   severity  taking all the above factors into account   origin  reachability  dependency file s   category   vulnerability   supply chain attack  see more in the detecting supply chain attacks section   exploit availability  fix availability  dependency relationship  first seen  original commitfilters  including a repository filter  are available here too  along with an option to export the table and download insights for report creation  this assists security teams in maintaining records in local storage and generating internal audit reports  these reports  emailed to the user  contain comprehensive information directly from the platform that can be shared with other team members and stakeholders note that there are 3 different tabs available on this screen   the  all  tab contains all the issues combined  providing data insights in a single page about the overall supply chain threat landscape   including vulnerabilities and attacks   the  recommended  tab contains the specific issues recommended for remediation per severity and reachability   essentially your  go to  pane when deciding what to tackle first   finally  the  low risk  tab has issues that you can deal with at a later point in time each issue also has its in depth analysis  with insights on the impact  scope  and origin of the issues shown on one screen  this detailed overview provides external links to the cve to learn more about it  as well as information about the affected repositories and a concrete remediation plan to ensure swift action can be taken on each issue the primary tabs available on this screen are   details   a primary overview of the vulnerability or supply chain attack  affected repositories   a list of all repositories that

of newly introduced vulnerabilities end up in the codebase after the remediation process is complete  attack overview  see next section for more details detecting supply chain attackskeep in mind that myrror does more than just detect vulnerabilities   it also detects various forms of supply chain attacks   including but not limited to   typosquatting  dependency confusion  malicious code in repo   code injection  ci cd attackwhen it detects those attacks  the detection mechanism and remediation plan might not be as straightforward as normal vulnerabilities  in those cases  myrror will show a more in depth analysis of the attack  enabling practitioners to grasp the situation and pinpoint the concrete link in the chain that s at fault  see below for an example of myrror s analysis of a code injection attack the remediation plan generatorplanning your remediation efforts typically requires comprehending the new threats introduced during patching  in most cases  applying a patch results in a new set of vulnerabilities due to the new dependencies  and their transitive dependencies  it introduces for every monitored repository  myrror simplifies the issue remediation process by automatically calculating the number of fixes available for all the issues  how many new vulnerabilities will be introduced during the remediation process  and how many issues will remain at the end conclusionappsec teams suffer from profound alert fatigue today  driven by an overwhelming amount of security issues and a lack of clear prioritization of what to work on first  in addition  most teams are completely unaware of the supply chain attacks they are exposed to and have no clear path for detecting them or offering proper remediation myrror s reachability based prioritization offers a way out of vulnerability hell  at the same time  their binary to source analysis mechanism enables detection of more than just simple vulnerabilities   and allows you to defend against a host of

152,recent versions of the raspberry robin malware are stealthier and implement one day exploits that are deployed only on systems that are susceptible to them one day exploits refer to code that leverages a vulnerability that the developer of the impacted software patched recently but the fix has either not been deployed to all clients or it has not been applied on all vulnerable systems from the moment the vendor discloses the vulnerability  which usually comes with publishing a patch  threat actors rush to create an exploit and use it before the fix propagates to a large number of systems according to a report from check point  raspberry robin has recently used at least two exploits for 1 day flaws  which indicates that the malware operator either has the capability to develop the code or has sources that provide it raspberry robin backgroundraspberry robin is a worm that red canary  a managed detection and response company  first identified in 2021  it spreads primarily through removable storage devices such as usb drives to establish a foothold on infected systems and facilitate the deployment of additional payloads since its discovery  raspberry robin has continuously evolved  adding new features  evasion techniques  and adopting several distribution methods  one example of evasion trick it implemented was to drop fake payloads to mislead researchers check point reports that it has observed an uptick in raspberry robin s operations starting october 2023  with large attack waves targeting systems worldwide a notable switch in recent campaigns is the use of the discord platform to drop malicious archive files onto the target  likely after emailing the links to the target the archives contain a digitally signed executable  oleview exe  and a malicious dll file  aclui dll  that is side loaded when the victim runs the executable  thus activating raspberry robin in the system targeting n day flawswhen raspberry robin is first run on a computer  it will automatically attempt to elevate privileges on the device using a variety of 1 day exploits check point highlights that the new raspberry robin campaign leverages exploits for cve 2023 36802  and cve 2023 29360  two local privilege escalation vulnerabilities in microsoft streaming service proxy and the windows tpm device driver in both cases  the researchers say  raspberry robin started exploiting the flaws using a then unknown exploit less than a month after the security issues were disclosed publicly  on june 13 and september 12  2023 as illustrated in the timeline diagram below  raspberry robin exploited the two flaws before security researchers first published proof of concept exploit code for the two flaws specifically  regarding cve 2023 36802  which enables attackers to escalate their privileges to the system level  cyfirma reported that an exploit had been available for purchase on the dark web since february 2023  a full seven months before microsoft acknowledged and addressed the issue this timeline suggests that raspberry robin acquires 1 day exploits from external sources almost immediately after their disclosure  as their cost as zero days is likely too much even for larger cybercrime operations check point found evidence that points to this theory as well  since the exploits used by raspberry robin were not embedded into the main 32 bit component  but deployed as external 64 bit executables  and also lack the heavy obfuscation typically seen with this malware new evasion mechanismscheck point s report also highlights several advancements in the latest raspberry robin variants  which include new anti analysis  evasion  and lateral movement mechanisms to evade security tools and os defenses  the malware now attempts to terminate specific processes like  runlegacycplelevated exe   related to use account control  uac   and patches the nttraceevent api to evade detection by event tracing for windows  etw  moreover  raspberry robin now checks if certain apis  like  getuserdefaultlangid  and  getmodulehandlew   are hooked by comparing the first byte of the api function to detect any monitoring processes by security products another interesting new tactic is the implementation of routines that use apis like  abortsystemshutdownw  and  shutdownblockreasoncreate  to prevent system shutdowns that could interrupt the malware s activity to conceal the command and control  c2  addresses  the malware first randomly engages with one of the 60 hard coded tor domains pointing to well known sites to make initial communications appear benign finally  raspberry robin now uses paexec exe instead of psexec exe to download the payload directly from the hosting location  this decision was likely made to increase its stealth  as psexec exe is known to be misused by hackers the researchers believe that raspberry robin will keep evolving and add new exploits to its arsenal  seeking code that has not been released publicly  based on observations during the malware analysis  it is likely that the operators of the malware does not create is connected to a developer that provides the exploit code check point s report provides a list of indicators of compromise for raspberry robin  which consists in hashes for the malware  multiple domains in the tor network  and discord urls for downloading

153,a new rust based macos malware spreading as a visual studio update to provide backdoor access to compromised systems uses infrastructure linked to the infamous alphv blackcat ransomware gang the campaign delivering the backdoor started since at least november 2023 and is still underway distributing newer variants of the malware written in rust  the malware can run on intel based  x86 64  and arm  apple silicon  architectures  say researchers at cybersecurity company bitdefender  who are tracking it as rustdoor potential link to ransomware operationswhile analyzing rustdoor  malware researchers at bitdefender discovered that the malware communicated with four command and control  c2  servers looking at threat intelligence data  the analysts found that three of them had been used in attacks potentially linked to ransomware attacks from an alphv blackcat affiliate however  the researchers highlight that this is insufficient evidence to confidently link the use of rustdoor to a particular threat actor and that  artifacts and iocs  indicators of compromise  suggest a possible relationship with the blackbasta and alphv blackcat ransomware operators  with cybercriminals having less freedom in choosing their infrastructure and being restricted to hosting services that provide anonymity and condone illegal activity  it is common for multiple threat actors to use the same servers for attacks while encryptors for the macos system exist  builds for apple m1 from lockbit created before december 2022  there are no public reports at this time of ransomware attacking apple s operating system most operations target windows and linux systems as enterprise environments use servers running these operating systems distribution detailsrustdoor is distributed primarily as an updater for visual studio for mac  microsoft s integrated development environment  ide  for the macos platform  which will be discontinued this year on august 31 the macos backdoor is delivered under multiple names  including  zshrc2    previewers    visualstudioupdater    visualstudioupdater patch    visualstudioupdating    visualstudioupdate   and  do not run chromeupdates  according to bitdefender  the malware has been under active distribution and have been undetected for at least three months the researchers discovered three versions of the malware  which come as fat binaries that include mach o files for both x86 64 intel and arm architectures but do not come bundled in typical parent files such as application bundles or disk image bitdefender says this atypical distribution method reduces the campaign s digital footprint and the likelihood of security products flagging the backdoor as suspicious backdoor capabilitiesin a report this week  the researchers say that rustdoor has commands to control the compromised system and to exfiltrate data  and it can persist on the device by modifying system files after infecting a system  the malware communicates with command and control  c2  servers using specific endpoints for registration  task execution  and data exfiltration the commands supported by the malware include the following   ps  lists running processes  useful for monitoring system activity   shell  executes arbitrary shell commands  giving attackers direct control   cd  changes the current directory  allowing navigation through the file system   mkdir  creates a new directory  useful for organizing stolen data or malware components   rm  removes files  potentially for deleting important files or cleaning up traces of the malware   rmdir  removes directories  similar to rm but for directories   sleep  pauses execution for a set time  possibly to evade detection or synchronize actions   upload  sends files to a remote server  used for exfiltrating stolen data   botkill  terminates other malware processes  possibly to eliminate competition or free system resources   dialog  displays messages or prompts to the user  potentially for phishing or to execute commands with user privileges   taskkill  ends specified processes  useful for stopping security software or other processes interfering with malware   download  retrieves files from a remote server  used for bringing additional malware components or updates onto the infected system the backdoor uses cron jobs and launchagents to schedule its execution at specific times or when the user logs in  thus making sure it survives system reboots moreover  it modifies the    zshrc file to execute in new terminal sessions or add it to the dock with system commands  which helps it blend in with legitimate applications and user activities bitdefender notes that there are at least three variants of rustdoor  the earliest one seen since early october 2023 the next one was seen november 22 and appeared to be a testing version that preceded an updated version observed on november 30  which includes  a complex json configuration as well as an embedded apple script used for exfiltration  of files with specific extensions the researchers provide a list of known indicators of compromise for rustdoor  which includes binaries  download domains  and urls

159,the threat actors behind the kv botnet made  behavioral changes  to the malicious network as usa law enforcement began issuing commands to neutralize the activity kv botnet is the name given to a network of compromised small office and home office  soho  routers and firewall devices across the world  with one specific cluster acting as a covert data transfer system for other chinese state sponsored actors  including volt typhoon  aka bronze silhouette  insidious taurus  or vanguard panda  active since at least february 2022  it was first documented by the black lotus labs team at lumen technologies in mid december 2023  the botnet is known to comprise two main sub groups  viz  kv and jdy  with the latter principally used for scanning potential targets for reconnaissance late last month  the usa government announced a court authorized disruption effort to take down the kv cluster  which is typically reserved for manual operations against high profile targets chosen after broader scanning via the jdy sub group now  according to new findings from the cybersecurity firm  the jdy cluster fell silent for roughly fifteen days following public disclosure and as a byproduct of the usa federal bureau of investigation  fbi  undertaking  in mid december 2023  we observed this activity cluster hovering around 1 500 active bots   security researcher ryan english said   when we sampled the size of this cluster in mid january 2024 its size dwindled to approximately 650 bots  given that the takedown actions began with a signed warrant issued on december 6  2023  it s fair to assume that the fbi began transmitting commands to routers located in the usa sometime on or after that date to wipe the botnet payload and prevent them from being re infected  we observed the kv botnet operators begin to restructure  committing eight straight hours of activity on december 8  2023  nearly ten hours of operations the following day on december 9  2023  followed by one hour on december 11  2023   lumen said in a technical report shared with the hacker news during this four day period  the threat actor was spotted interacting with 3 045 unique ip addresses that were associated with netgear prosafes  2 158   cisco rv320 325  310   axis ip cameras  29   draytek vigor routers  17   and other unidentified devices  531  also observed in early december 2023 was a massive spike in exploitation attempts from the payload server  indicating the adversary s likely attempts to re exploit the devices as they detected their infrastructure going offline  lumen said it also took steps to null route another set of backup servers that became operational around the same time it s worth noting that the operators of the kv botnet are known to perform their own reconnaissance and targeting while also supporting multiple groups like volt typhoon  interestingly  the timestamps associated with exploitation of the bots correlates to china working hours  our telemetry indicates that there were administrative connections into the known payload servers from ip addresses associated with china telecom   danny adamitis  principal information security engineer at black lotus labs  told the hacker news what s more  the press statement from the usa justice department described the botnet as controlled by  people s republic of china  prc  state sponsored hackers  this raises the possibility that the botnet  was created by an organization supporting the volt typhoon hackers  whereas if the botnet was created by volt typhoon  we suspect they would have said  nation state  actors   adamitis added there are also signs that the threat actors established a third related but distinct botnet cluster dubbed x sh as early as january 2023 that s composed of infected cisco routers by deploying a web shell named  fys sh   as highlighted by securityscorecard last month but with kv botnet being just  one form of infrastructure used by volt typhoon to obfuscate their activity   it s expected that the recent wave of actions will prompt the advanced persistent threat  apt  actors to presumably transition to another covert network in order to meet their strategic goals  a significant percent of all networking equipment in use around the world is functioning perfectly well  but is no longer supported   english said   end users have a difficult financial choice when a device reaches that point  and many aren t even aware that a router or firewall is at the end of its supported life  advanced threat actors are well aware that this represents fertile ground for exploitation  replacing unsupported devices is always the best choice  but not always feasible   mitigation involves defenders adding their edge devices to the long list of those they already have to patch and update as often as available  rebooting devices and configuring edr or sase solutions where applicable  and keeping an eye on large data transfers out of the network

162,critical vulnerability in mastodon is pounced upon by fast acting adminsdanger of remote account takeovers leaves lead devs scared of releasing many detailsmastodon has called admins to action following the disclosure of a critical vulnerability affecting the decentralized social network favored by erstwhile twitter lovers with a 9 4 severity score  exploiting cve 2024 23832 potentially allows attackers to take over mastodon accounts remotely while very little has been released by way of technical details – allowing admins time to patch before attackers devise exploits – vulnerabilities with such high cvss scores tend to lead to severe consequences on the affected product and are often relatively easy to exploit  due to insufficient origin validation in all mastodon  attackers can impersonate and take over any remote account   said eugen rochko  ceo and lead developer at mastodon  in a security advisory  every mastodon version prior to 3 5 17 is vulnerable  as well as 4 0 x versions prior to 4 0 13  4 1 x version prior to 4 1 13  and 4 2 x versions prior to 4 2 5  rochko said that full details of the vulnerability will be published on february 15  giving admins two weeks to upgrade to the latest version  he said that the disclosure of  any amount of detail would make it very easy to come up with an exploit  mastodon is a decentralized social network  meaning it runs on separate servers  independently owned and operated by their respective administrators although this brings benefits like enabling specific rules and restrictions for different communities  it also means each must be updated by the admins individually  it s not a case where the entire platform can go down for maintenance for an hour and everything is fixed  the underlying engineering of the mastodon platform is different than other social media networks in that it is a decentralized system   said elliott wilkes  chief technology officer at advanced cyber defence systems  each instance of mastodon is hosted separately from all others  and while there are common links to allow moving between instances  they are separate  owned  and operated by different people  with different teams managing the security of each  for this reason  each instance of mastodon requires an economy of scale to support its operations  including people to manage infrastructure and security engineering  this is one of the major trade offs between mastodon and a centralized social media company like meta or instagram  there s just not the same investment in security because there s not massive revenue supporting the platform  and each owner of an instance has to perform security management on their own  there aren t enough details here yet to say exactly why mastodon is vulnerable and other platforms aren t but different source code repositories won t share vulnerabilities unless there is an inherent flaw in one of the open source packages that are shared between both products  the good news for mastodon users is that more than half of all active servers have already upgraded to the latest version in the space of a day  according to data from fediverse network stat collector fedidb such a fast patch rate was likely the product of how well the mastodon community publicized the matter  not only was rochko s advisory shared across different instances rapidly  but as screenshots of admin panels show  the platform itself also plastered clear warnings  making it fairly difficult to escape the urgent need to update a quick scan of the security advisory history at mastodon shows this isn t the only security issue the platform has had to patch over the past year  with two critical bugs  cve 2023 36460 and cve 2023 36459  emerging in july 2023   how not to

equilend s systems are now back online after announcing a disruptive ransomware attack nearly two weeks ago equilend was founded in 2001 by some of wall street s biggest players – its board of directors includes blackrock  goldman sachs  jp morgan  morgan stanley and more – and is primarily known for its next generation trading  ngt  platform  which underpins a large chunk of the sector s securities lending the platform transacts  113 5 billion every day between more than 120 companies across more than 40 markets  the company also has regulatory tech  data analytics  and securities finance arms providing regular updates via a dedicated web page  equilend almost completed its full restoration last week  waiting only for its data and analytics solutions to get back up and running  as our internal team and third party experts have continued working diligently on recovery  we have reached a much anticipated milestone  all equilend client facing services are now available   said the wall street staple  we look forward to providing the high quality service and user experience our clients have come to expect from us across all our services  and we remain incredibly grateful for your patience and support as we worked up to this point  we have and will continue to keep our clients informed with relevant updates  clients whose questions are not answered by the frequently asked questions linked on this page may contact their client relationship manager  equilend began the full restoration after it pulled systems offline following the discovery of the malicious behavior  according to cybersecurity expert kevin beaumont  lockbit claimed responsibility for the attack but never posted equilend to its leak blog  an observation he claims suggests the company negotiated a ransom payment for clarity  it must be said that equilend has not commented on whether a ransom was paid or not  we contacted the business for a comment but it didn t immediately respond a ransomware group s leak site serves as one of the key tools available to cyber extortionists  the idea is that if a ransom agreement can t be met swiftly  the victim s details are posted online so everyone knows the organization is suffering a ransomware incident the hope  then  is that the negotiations will be hurried along before the victim s data is posted online – the next move for cybercriminals looking to apply pressure to victims – which can include sensitive identity documents such as passport scans of staff  for example at the time of the incident s announcement  equilend was vocal about how proud it is of its  rigorous backups   hinting that it may snub lockbit s demands and restore itself from those backups instead as a company whose services are so critical to the smooth running of such a lucrative industry  equilend s incentive to pay would have been significant  despite the practice being strictly discouraged by the us and many other nations the company updated its faq page this week to reflect the system restoration but didn t update other sections regarding questions around how the attackers broke in nor has equilend updated its communication regarding whether any data

164,chinese coathanger malware hung out to dry by dutch defense departmentattack happened in 2023 using a bespoke backdoor  confirming year old suspicionsdutch authorities are lifting the curtain on an attempted cyberattack last year at its ministry of defense  mod   blaming chinese state sponsored attackers for the espionage focused intrusion specialists from the netherlands  military intelligence and security service  mivd  and the general intelligence and security service  aivd  were called in to investigate an intrusion at an mod network last year  uncovering a previously unseen malware they re calling coathanger the name  authorities said  was conjured up based on the  peculiar phrase  displayed by the malware when encrypting the configuration on disk   she took his coat and hung it up  a deep dive into coathanger s code revealed the remote access trojan  rat  was purpose built for fortinet s fortigate next generation firewalls  ngfws  and the initial access to the mod s network was gained through exploiting cve 2022 42475 according to the mivd and aivd  the rat operates outside of traditional detection measures and acts as a second stage malware  mainly to establish persistent access for attackers  surviving reboots and firmware upgrades even fully patched fortigate devices could still have coathanger installed if they were compromised before upgrading in the cybersecurity advisory published today  authorities said the malware was highly stealthy and difficult to detect using default fortigate cli commands  since coathanger hooks most system calls that could identify it as malicious they also made clear that coathanger is definitely different from boldmove  another rat targeting fortigate appliances  for the first time  the mivd has chosen to make public a technical report on the working methods of chinese hackers  it is important to attribute such espionage activities by china   said defense minister kajsa ollongren in an automatically translated statement   in this way  we increase international resilience against this type of cyber espionage  the advisory also noted that dutch authorities had previously spotted coathanger present on other victims  networks too  prior to the incident at the mod as for attribution  mivd and aivd said they can pin coathanger to chinese state sponsored attackers with  high confidence   mivd and aivd emphasize that this incident does not stand on its own  but is part of a wider trend of chinese political espionage against the netherlands and its allies   the advisory reads   where there s a will  there s a way to get us chips into china  china  readies production  of homegrown high bandwidth memory  uncle sam designates more chinese tech slingers as military collaborators  congress told how chinese goons plan to incite  societal chaos  in the usthe attackers responsible for the attack were known for conducting  wide and opportunistic  scans for exposed fortigate appliances vulnerable to cve 2022 42475 and then exploiting it using an obfuscated connection after gaining an initial foothold inside the network  which was used by the mod s research and development division  the attackers performed reconnaissance and stole a list of user accounts from the active directory server not much else was said about the attacker s activity  other than the fact that the overall impact of the intrusion was limited thanks to the mod s network segmentation for those worried about whether chinese cyberspies are lurking in their firewall  the joint signal cyber unit of the netherlands  jcsu nl  published a full list of indicators of compromise  iocs  and various detection methods on its github page the collection of materials includes yara rules  a ja3 hash  cli commands  file checksums  and more  the authorities said each detection method should be seen as independent and used together since some focus on general iocs and others were developed to spot coathanger activity specifically if there is evidence of compromise  it s possible other hosts that are reachable by the fortigate device are also compromised  there is also an increased likelihood that attackers may perform hands on keyboard attacks affected users should isolate their device immediately  collect and review logs  and consider calling in third party digital forensics specialists  the advisory reads  victims should also inform their country s cybersecurity authority  ncsc  cisa  etc the only way to remove coathanger from an infected device is to completely reformat the device  before reinstalling and reconfiguring it whiffs of china s involvement in cve 2022 42475 exploits have long been suspected  but for the first time they re confirmed today first disclosed in december 2022  a month later fortinet said it was aware that the vulnerability was tied to the breach of a government or government related organization that had been infected with custom made malware at the time  no fingers were officially pointed other than the fact that this custom malware was compiled on a machine in the utc 8 timezone  so realistically it was most likely going to be either china or russia china was also

167,incident response  ir  is a race against time  you engage your internal or external team because there s enough evidence that something bad is happening  but you re still blind to the scope  the impact  and the root cause  the common set of ir tools and practices provides ir teams with the ability to discover malicious files and outbound network connections  however  the identity aspect   namely the pinpointing of compromised user accounts that were used to spread in your network   unfortunately remains unattended  this task proves to be the most time consuming for ir teams and has become a challenging uphill battle that enables attackers to earn precious time in which they can still inflict damage in this article  we analyze the root cause of the identity of ir blind spots and provide sample ir scenarios in which it acts as an inhibitor to a rapid and efficient process  we then introduce silverfort s unified identity protection platform and show how its real time mfa and identity segmentation can overcome this blind spot and make the difference between a contained incident and a costly breach ir 101  knowledge is power  time is everythingthe triggering of an ir process can come in a million shapes  they all share a resemblance in that you think – or are even sure – that something is wrong  but you don t know exactly what  where  and how  if you re lucky  your team spotted the threat when it s still building up its power inside but hasn t yet executed its malicious objective  if you re not so lucky  you become aware of the adversarial presence only after its impact has already broken out – encrypted machines  missing data  and any other form of malicious activity that way or the other  the most urgent task once the ir starts rolling is to dissolve the darkness and get clear insights into the compromised entities within your environment  once located and validated  steps can be taken to contain the attacks by quarantining machines  blocking outbound traffic  removing malicious files  and resetting user accounts as it happens  the last task is far from trivial when dealing with compromised user accounts and introduces a yet unaddressed challenge  let s understand why that is identity ir gap  1  no playbook move to detect compromised accountsunlike malware files or malicious outbound network connections  a compromised account doesn t do anything that is essentially malicious – it merely logs in to resources in the same manner a normal account would  if it s an admin account that accesses multiple workstations and servers on a daily basis – which is the case in many attacks – its lateral movement won t even seem anomalous want to learn more about the silverfort platform s incident response capabilities  schedule a demo today the result is that the discovery of the compromised account takes place only after the compromised machines are located and quarantined  and even then  it entails manually checking all the accounts that are logged there  and again – when racing against time  the dependency on manual and error prone investigation creates a critical delay identity ir gap  2  no playbook move to immediately contain the attack and prevent further spreadas in real life  there s a stage of immediate first aid that precedes full treatment  the equivalent in the ir world is to contain the attack within its current boundaries and ensure it doesn t spread further  even prior to discovering its active components  on the network level  it s done by temporarily isolating segments that potentially host malicious activity from those that are not yet compromised  at the endpoint level  it s done by quarantining machines where malware is located here again  the identity aspect needs to catch up  the only available containment is disabling the user account in ad or resetting its password  the first option is a no go due to the operational disruption it introduces  especially in the case of false positives  the second option is not good either  if the suspected account is a machine to machine service account  resetting its password is likely to break the critical processes it manages  ending up with additional damage on top of the one the attack has caused  if the adversary has managed to compromise the identity infrastructure itself  resetting the password will be immediately addressed by shifting to another account identity ir gap  3  no playbook move to reduce exposed identity attack surfaces that adversaries target within the attackthe weaknesses that expose the identity attack surface to malicious credential access  privilege escalation  and lateral movement are blind spots for the posture and hygiene products in the security stack  this deprives the ir team of critical indications of compromise that could have significantly accelerated the process prominent examples are vulnerable authentication protocols like ntlm  or  even worse  ntlmv1   misconfigurations like accounts set with unconstrained delegation  shadow admins  stale users  and many more  adversaries feast on these weaknesses as they make their living off the land route  the inability to locate and reconfigure or protect accounts and machines that feature these weaknesses turns the ir into a cat herding  where while the analyst is busy analyzing to see if account a is compromised  the adversaries are already leveraging compromised account b bottom line  no tools  no shortcuts  just slow and manual log analysis while the attack is in full gearso  that s the status quo  when the ir team needs to finally discover who the compromised user accounts are that the attacker is using to spread in your environment  this is a secret no one talks about and the true root cause as to why lateral movement attacks are so successful and hard to contain  even when the ir process is taking place silverfort unified identity protection for ir operationssilverfort s unified identity protection platform integrates with the identity infrastructure on prem and in the cloud  active directory  entra id  okta  ping  etc    this integration enables silverfort to have full visibility into any authentication and access attempt  real time access enforcement to prevent malicious access with either mfa or access block  and automated discovery and protection of service accounts let s see how these capabilities accelerate and optimize the identity ir process detection of compromised accounts with mfa with zero operational disruptionsilverfort is the only solution that can enforce mfa protection on all ad authentication  including command line tools like psexec and powershell  with this capability  a single policy that requires all user accounts to verify their identity with mfa can detect all compromised accounts in minutes once the policy is configured  the flow is simple   the adversary attempts to continue its malicious access and logs into a machine with the account s compromised credentials   the true user is prompted with mfa and denies that they have requested access to the specified resource goal  1 achieved  there s now evidence beyond doubt that this account is compromised side note  now that there s a validated compromised account  all we need to do is filter all the machines that this account has logged into in silverfort s log screen contain the attack with mfa and block access policiesthe mfa policy we ve described above not only serves to detect which accounts are compromised but also to prevent any additional spread of the attack  this enables the ir team to freeze the adversary s foothold where it is and ensure that all the yet non compromised resources stay intact protection with operational disruption revisited  zoom in on service accountsspecial attention should be given to service accounts as they are heavily abused by threat actors  these machine to machine accounts are not associated with a human user and cannot be subject to mfa protection however  silverfort automatically discovers these accounts and gains insights into their repetitive behavioral patterns  with this visibility  silverfort enables the configuration of policies that block access whenever a service account deviates from its behavior  in that manner  all of the standard service account activity is not disrupted  while any malicious attempt to abuse it is blocked goal  2 achieved  attack is contained and the ir team can rapidly move to investigationeliminating exposed weaknesses in the identity attack surfacesilverfort s visibility into all authentications and access attempts within the environment enables it to discover and mitigate common weaknesses that attackers take advantage of  here are a few examples   setting mfa policies for all shadow admins  setting block access policies for any ntlmv1 authentications  discover all accounts that were configured without pre authentication  discover all accounts that were configured with unconstrained delegationthis attack surface reduction will usually take place during the initial  first aid  stage goal  3 achieved  identity weaknesses are mitigated and cannot be used for malicious propagation conclusion  gaining identity ir capabilities is imperative   are you ready compromised accounts are a key component in over 80  of cyber attacks  making the risk of getting hit an almost certainty  security stakeholders should invest in having ir tools that can address this aspect in order to ensure their ability to respond efficiently when such an attack

171,just one bad packet can bring down a vulnerable dns server thanks to dnssec you don t have to do more than that to disconnect an entire network  el reg told as patches emergeupdated a single packet can exhaust the processing capacity of a vulnerable dns server  effectively disabling the machine  by exploiting a 20 plus year old design flaw in the dnssec specification that would make it trivial to take down a dnssec validating dns resolver that has yet to be patched  upsetting all the clients relying on that service and make it seem as though websites and apps were offline the academics who found this flaw – associated with the german national research center for applied cybersecurity  athene  in darmstadt – claimed dns server software makers briefed about the vulnerability described it as  the worst attack on dns ever discovered  identified by professor haya schulmann and niklas vogel of the goethe university frankfurt  elias heftrig of fraunhofer sit  and professor michael waidner at the technical university of darmstadt and fraunhofer sit  the security hole has been named keytrap  designated cve 2023 50387  and assigned a cvss severity rating of 7 5 out of 10 as of december 2023  approximately 31 percent of web clients worldwide used dnssec validating dns resolvers and  like other applications relying on those systems  would feel the effects of a keytrap attack  with those dns servers taken out by the flaw  clients relying on them would be unable to resolve domain and host names to ip addresses to use  resulting in a loss of connectivity the researchers said lone dns packets exploiting keytrap could stall public dnssec validated dns services  such as those provided by google and cloudflare  by making them do calculations that overtax server cpu cores this disruption of dns could not only deny people s access to content but could also interfere with other systems  including spam defenses  cryptographic defenses  pki   and inter domain routing security  rpki   the researchers assert  exploitation of this attack would have severe consequences for any application using the internet including unavailability of technologies such as web browsing  e mail  and instant messaging   they claimed   with keytrap  an attacker could completely disable large parts of the worldwide internet  a non public technical paper on the vulnerability provided to the register  titled   the keytrap denial of service algorithmic complexity attacks on dns   describes how an assault would be carried out  it basically involves asking a vulnerable dnssec validating dns resolver to look up an address that causes the server to contact a malicious nameserver that sends a reply that causes the resolver to consume most or all of its own cpu resources with keytrap  an attacker could completely disable large parts of the worldwide internet to initiate the attacks our adversary causes the victim resolver to look up a record in its malicious domain   the due to be published paper states   the attacker’s nameserver responds to the dns queries with a malicious record set  rrset   according to the specific attack vector and zone configuration  the attack works  the paper explains  because the dnssec spec follows postel’s law   the nameservers should send all the available cryptographic material  and the resolvers should use any of the cryptographic material they receive until the validation is successful  this requirement  to ensure availability  means dnssec validating dns resolvers can be forced to do a lot of work if presented with colliding key tags and colliding keys that must be validated  our complexity attacks are triggered by feeding the dns resolvers with specially crafted dnssec records  which are constructed in a way that exploits validation vulnerabilities in cryptographic validation logic   the paper explains  when the dns resolvers attempt to validate the dnssec records they receive from our nameserver  they get stalled  our attacks are extremely stealthy  being able to stall resolvers between 170 seconds and 16 hours  depending on the resolver software  with a single dns response packet    if your dns queries look like this  it s not a ransom note  it s a security improvement  internet s safe keepers forced to postpone crucial dnssec root key signing ceremony – no  not a hacker attack  but because they can t open a safe  is dnssec causing more problems than it solves   icann proposes creating  internal domain to do the same job as 192 168 x xthe athene boffins said they worked with all relevant vendors and major public dns providers to privately disclose the vulnerability so a coordinated patch release would be possible  the last patch was finished today  we are aware of this vulnerability and rolled out a fix in coordination with the reporting researchers   a google spokesperson told the register   there is no evidence of exploitation and no action required by users at this time  network research lab nlnet labs published a patch for its unbound dns software  addressing two vulnerabilities  one of which is keytrap  the other bug fixed  cve 2023 50868  referred to as the nsec3 vulnerability  also allows denial of service through cpu exhaustion  the keytrap vulnerability works by using a combination of keys  also colliding keys   signatures and number of rrsets on a malicious zone   nlnet labs wrote   answers from that zone can force a dnssec validator down a very cpu intensive and time costly validation path  powerdns  meanwhile  has an update here to thwart keytrap exploitation  an attacker can publish a zone that contains crafted dnssec related records  while validating results from queries to that zone using the rfc mandated algorithms  the recursor’s resource usage can become so high that processing of other queries is impacted  resulting in a denial of service   the team wrote   note that any resolver following the rfcs can be impacted  this is not a problem of this particular implementation  the fix for cve 2023 50387 is just one of six vulnerabilities addressed in internet systems consortium s bind 9 dns software  the others include   cve 2023 4408  parsing large dns messages may cause excessive cpu load   cve 2023 5517  querying rfc 1918 reverse zones may cause an assertion failure when  nxdomain redirect  is enabled   cve 2023 5679  enabling both dns64 and serve stale may cause an assertion failure during recursive resolution   cve 2023 6516  specific recursive query patterns may lead to an out of memory condition   cve 2023 50868  preparing an nsec3 closest encloser proof can exhaust cpu resources the requirements for the keytrap vulnerability date all the way back to 1999 from the now obsolete rfc 2535  according to the research team that identified it  and by 2012  these elements appeared in rfc 6781 and rfc 6840  the implementation requirements for dnssec validation one packet suffices  you don t have to do more than that to disconnect an entire networksince at least august 2000 – more than 23 years ago – keytrap has been present in the bind 9 dns resolver  and it surfaced seven years later in the unbound dns resolver dr haya shulman  a professor of computer science and one of the academics behind the keytrap research  told the register in a phone interview the attack is simple and can be carried out by encoding it in a zone file  the vulnerability is actually something that s recommended in the dnssec standard   prof shulman explained   one packet suffices  you don t have to do more than that to disconnect an entire network  prof shulman said the patches that have been issued by various vendors break the standard   the problem is this attack is not easy to solve   she said   if we launch it against a patched resolver  we still get 100 percent cpu usage but it can still respond  the athene team observed that while the flaw remained undetected for decades  its obscurity isn t surprising because dnssec validation requirements are so complicated  so too is mitigating the vulnerability and completely eliminating it will require a revision of the dnssec standard  ®updated to add on february 16you can now download the technical paper here as a pdf also  akamai exec sven dummer thanked the research team for not only discovering the flaw but also working with dns providers and software makers to coordinate the patching and redeployment of systems to avoid mass exploitation  you might not know it  but the global internet dodged a bullet  keytrap is a vulnerability in key infrastructure that is needed for the internet to function — and one of the worst ever discovered   he opined  with keytrap  an attacker could completely disable large parts of the worldwide internet

175,when it comes to access security  one recommendation stands out above the rest  multi factor authentication  mfa   with passwords alone being simple work for hackers  mfa provides an essential layer of protection against breaches  however  it s important to remember that mfa isn t foolproof  it can be bypassed  and it often is if a password is compromised  there are several options available to hackers looking to circumvent the added protection of mfa  we ll explore four social engineering tactics hackers successfully use to breach mfa and emphasize the importance of having a strong password as part of a layered defense 1  adversary in the middle  aitm  attacksaitm attacks involve deceiving users into believing they re logging into a genuine network  application  or website  but really  they re giving up their information to a fraudulent lookalike  this lets hackers intercept passwords and manipulate security measures  including mfa prompts  for instance  a spear phishing email may arrive in an employee s inbox  posing as a trusted source  clicking on the embedded link directs them to a counterfeit website where hackers collect their login credentials while mfa should ideally prevent these attacks by requiring an additional authentication factor  hackers can employ a technique known as  2fa pass on   once the victim enters their credentials on the fake site  the attacker promptly enters the same details on the legitimate site  this triggers a legitimate mfa request  which the victim anticipates and readily approves  unwittingly granting the attacker complete access this is a common tactic for threat groups such as storm 1167  who are known for crafting fake microsoft authentication pages to harvest credentials  they also create a second phishing page that mimics the mfa step of the microsoft login process  prompting the victim to put in their mfa code and grant the attackers access  from there  they gain access to a legitimate email account and can use it as a platform for a multi stage phishing attack 2  mfa prompt bombingthis tactic takes advantage of the push notification feature in modern authentication apps  after compromising a password  attackers attempt to login which sends an mfa prompt to the legitimate user s device  they rely on the user either mistaking it for a genuine prompt and accepting it or becoming frustrated with continuous prompts and accepting one to stop the notifications  this technique  known as mfa prompt bombing  poses a significant threat in a notable incident  hackers from the 0ktapus group compromised an uber contractor s login credentials through sms phishing  then continued with the authentication process from a machine they controlled and immediately requested a multi factor authentication  mfa  code  they then impersonated an uber security team member on slack  convincing the contractor to accept the mfa push notification on their phone 3  service desk attacksattackers deceive helpdesks into bypassing mfa by feigning password forgetfulness and gaining access through phone calls  if service desk agents fail to enforce proper verification procedures  they may unknowingly grant hackers an initial entry point into their organization s environment  a recent example was the mgm resorts attack  where the scattered spider hacker group fraudulently contacted the service desk for a password reset  giving them a foothold to log in and launch a ransomware attack hackers also try to exploit recovery settings and back up procedures by manipulating service desks to circumvent mfa  0ktapus have been known to resort to targeting an organization s service desk if their mfa prompt bombing proves unsuccessful  they ll contact service desks claiming their phone is inoperable or lost  then request to enroll in a new  attacker controlled mfa authentication device  they can then exploit the organization s recovery or backup process by getting a password reset link sent to the compromised device  concerned about service desk security gaps  learn how to secure yours 4  sim swappingcybercriminals understand mfa often relies on cell phones as a means of authentication  they can exploit this with a technique called a  sim swap   where hackers deceive service providers into transferring a target s services to a sim card under their control  they can then effectively take over the target s cell service and phone number  letting them intercept mfa prompts and gain unauthorized access to accounts after an incident in 2022  microsoft published a report detailing the tactics employed by the threat group lapsus   the report explained how lapsus  dedicates extensive social engineering campaigns to gaining initial footholds in target organizations  one of their favored techniques is targeting users with sim swapping attacks  along with mfa prompt bombing  and resetting a target s credentials through help desk social engineering you can t fully rely on mfa – password security still mattersthis wasn t an exclusive list of ways to bypass mfa  there are several others ways too  including compromising endpoints  exporting generated tokens  exploiting sso  and finding unpatched technical deficiencies  it s clear that setting up mfa doesn t mean organizations can forget about securing passwords altogether account compromise still often starts with weak or compromised passwords  once an attacker obtains a valid password  they can then shift their focus towards bypassing the mfa mechanism  even a strong password can t protect users if it s been compromised through a breach or password reuse  and for most organizations  going fully passwordless won t be a practical option with a tool like specops password policy  you can enforce robust active directory password policies to eliminate weak passwords and continuously scan for compromised passwords resulting from breaches  password reuse  or being sold after a phishing attack  this ensures that mfa serves as an additional layer of security as intended  rather than being solely relied upon as a silver bullet solution  if you re interested in exploring how specops password policy can fit with your organization s specific needs  please contact us ,marketing,emerging threats and attack techniques,"{'vulnerability reports':

180,february 13  2024press releasesan francisco  ca – feb 13  2024about 77  of organizations have adopted or are exploring ai in some capacity  pushing for a more efficient and automated workflow  with the increasing reliance on genai models and language learning models  llms  like chatgpt  the need for robust security measures have become paramount akto  a leading api security company  is proud to announce the launch of its revolutionary genai security testing solution  this cutting edge technology marks a significant milestone in the field of ai security  making akto the world s first proactive genai security testing platform “akto has a new capability to scan apis that leverage ai technology and this is fundamental for the future of application security  i invested early in building application  security education for ai and i’m thrilled to see other security companies do the same for security assessment around ai technologies ”   jim manico  former owasp global board member  secure coding educator on average  an organization uses 10 genai models  often most llms in production will receive data indirectly via apis  that means tons and tons of sensitive data is being processed by the llm apis  ensuring the security of these apis will be very crucial to protect user privacy and prevent data leaks  there are several ways in which llms can be abused today  leading to sensitive data leaks prompt injection vulnerabilities   the risk of unauthorized prompt injections  where malicious inputs can manipulate the llm’s output  has become a major concern denial of service  dos  threats   llms are also susceptible to dos attacks  where the system is overloaded with requests  leading to service disruptions  there s been a rise in reported dos incidents targeting llm apis in the last year overreliance on llm outputs   overreliance on llms without adequate verification mechanisms has led to cases of data inaccuracies and leaks  organizations are encouraged to implement robust validation processes  as the industry sees an increase in data leak incidents due to overreliance on llms “securing genai systems requires a multifaceted approach with the need to protect not only the ai from external inputs but also external systems that depend on their outputs  “   owasp top 10 for llm ai applications core team member on march 20  2023  there was an outage with openai s ai tool  chatgpt  the outage was caused by a vulnerability in an open source library  which may have exposed payment related information of some customers  very recently  on january 25  2024  a critical vulnerability was discovered in anything llm   8 000 github stars  that turns any document or piece of content into context that any llm can use during chatting  an unauthenticated api route  file export  can allow attackers to crash the server resulting in a denial of service attack  these are only a few examples of security incidents related to using llm models akto s genai security testing solution addresses these challenges head on  by leveraging advanced testing methodologies and state of the art algorithms  akto provides comprehensive security assessments for genai models  including llms  the solution incorporates a wide range of innovative features  including over 60 meticulously designed test cases that cover various aspects of genai

of protection for organizations deploying genai models akto  a company based in san francisco  is a leading api security company that specializes in providing cutting edge solutions to protect apis from security vulnerabilities  with a team of experts in ai security and a passion for innovation  akto is committed to enabling organizations to secure their applications from attacks and ensure secure use of genai apis  learn more about akto here currently  security teams manually test all the llm apis for flaws before release  due to the time sensitivity of product releases  teams can only test for a few vulnerabilities  as hackers continue to find more creative ways to exploit llms  security teams need to find an automated way to secure llms at scale “often input to an llm comes from an end user or the output is shown to the end user or both  the tests try to exploit llm vulnerabilities through different encoding methods  separators and markers  this specially detects weak security practices where developers encode the input or put special markers around the input  “   ankush jain  cto at akto ioai security testing also detects weak security measures against sanitizing output of llms  it aims to detect attempts to inject malicious code for remote execution  cross site scripting  xss   and other attacks that could allow attackers to extract session tokens and system information  in addition  akto also tests whether the llms are susceptible to generating false or irrelevant reports “from prompt injection   llm 01  to overreliance  llm09  and new vulnerabilities and breaches everyday and build systems that are secure by default  it is critical to test systems early for these ever evolving threats  i’m excited to see what akto has in store for my llm projects”   owasp top 10 for llm ai applications core team member to further emphasize the importance of genai security  a recent survey in september  2023 by gartner revealed that 34  of organizations are

185,february 13  2024the widespread  multitooled glupteba malware has adopted a unified extensible firmware interface  uefi  bootkit  allowing it to stealthily persist inside of windows systems despite reboots  by manipulating the process by which the operating system is loaded glupteba is a malware behemoth  a combination backdoor infostealer loader cryptominer malvertiser botnet  built modularly to allow even more components to be added at will by its operators  among its many capabilities are some extra special features  too  such as using the bitcoin blockchain as a backup command and control  c2  system  and being able to hide itself with windows kernel drivers its latest shiny feature is an upgrade on that last bit  in a campaign observed by palo alto networks  unit 42 last november  glupteba came fitted with an incisive bootloader implant  ensuring that it can start running on infected windows machines even before windows itself does the new bootloaderin years prior  glupteba achieved serious levels of persistence and evasion by manipulating windows drivers  it would drop a known vulnerable driver  then use open source tools like dsefix or upgdsed to override windows  requirement that drivers be validated by digital signatures now the botnet has incorporated a new open source tool called efiguard  which achieves even more sophisticated  lower level access by taking advantage of uefi  a specification which replaced the basic input output system  bios   used to connect a machine s firmware to its operating system in short  the bootkit contains an implant for the efi system partition  esp  — located in a machine s boot device and containing the windows boot manager — which disables driver signature enforcement as well as patchguard  the windows function that prevents changes to the kernel  it allows glupteba to operate in this privileged space  executing its code before windows is able to start up in the first place  making the job of detecting and removing it far more difficult for affected organizations only a few such bootkits have ever been discovered in the wild before  the uefi bootloader of glupteba poses serious threats to targeted organizations and can potentially lead to persistent infection  unauthorized access  control over firmware  data loss  and operational disruptions   warns lior rochberger  cortex threat researcher at palo alto networks   those risks become more challenging and serious  especially since once the bootkit is installed it is very hard to discover and remediate  in the worst case scenario  the operators might even manipulate the hardware component and cause long term damage to the infected machines  as palo alto noted in its report  any given scenario — depending on the architecture  os version  and configuration of a targeted machine — might call for dsefix  upgdsed  or efiguard  however  none of the three appear to bypass windows  secure boot feature  like blacklotus can glupteba s remarkable longevity   spreadbesides being one of the most powerful  glupteba is also one of the world s longest standing examples of malware out there beginning as a simple backdoor in the early 2010s  it gradually evolved into a multipronged botnet able to steal credit card data and credentials from various software  perform digital ad fraud  hijack and mine cryptocurrencies  gain remote admin access on routers  and download additional payloads with more features therein it can be no wonder  then  that by the following decade it already had more than a million windows devices under its spell  with thousands more added every day  glupteba got so big that  powerless to stop it by conventional means  it inspired litigation from google google s efforts helped disrupt glupteba until it roared back in december 2022  rochberger attributes its revival to the pay per install  ppi  market  in which dark web traffickers charge operators of malware such as glupteba a certain number of infections worldwide in exchange for flat rate payments  the industries affected were diverse  since distribution follows more of an approach of spreading as much as possible  not to specific targets   she explains  the same goes for geographic regions  glupteba s 2023 campaign spread across countries as diverse as greece and nepal  bangladesh  brazil  korea  algeria  ukraine  slovakia  turkey  italy  and sweden for organizations already affected  as well as those more lucky  rochberger recommends proactivity and diligence  the most important thing is to keep good security hygiene and good security posture — using the most up to date security products and applying a multilayered approach that enables organizations to not only detect   she says   but also to prevent

alto networks has  however  led to some confusion over the severity of the security problem qnap assigned cve 2023 50358 a middling 5 8 out of 10 severity score  the breakdown of which revealed it was classified as a high complexity attack that would have a low impact if exploited successfully unit 42 s assessment  on the other hand  was the polar opposite   these remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting iot devices exhibit a combination of low attack complexity and critical impact  making them an irresistible target for threat actors  as a result  protecting iot devices against such threats is an urgent task  the german federal office for information security  bsi  also released an emergency alert today warning that successful exploits could lead to  major damage   encouraging users to apply patches quickly at the time of writing  the national vulnerability database  nvd  is still working to assign the vulnerability an independent rating typically  command injection vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit tend to attract severity scores at the higher end of the scale  so it will be interesting to see what the nvd s score ends up being according to unit42 s internet scans of vulnerable devices carried out in mid january  289 665 separate ip addresses registered a vulnerable  public facing device germany and the us were the most exposed  with 42 535 and 36 865 vulnerable devices respectively  while china  italy  japan  taiwan  and france trailed each with over 10 000 devices exposed exploiting cve 2023 50358unlike qnap  unit 42 published a technical breakdown of cve 2023 50358 and how to exploit the vulnerability it s classed as a command injection flaw in the quick cgi component of qnap s qts firmware  which runs on most of its nas devices  while setting the http request parameter todo set timeinfo  the request handler in quick cgi saves the value of the parameter specific server into a configuration file  tmp quick quick tmp conf with the entry name ntp address   the researchers explained  after writing the ntp server address  the component starts time synchronization using the ntpdate utility  the command line execution is built by reading the ntp address in quick tmp conf  and this string is then executed using system    untrusted data from the specific server parameter is therefore used to build a command line to be executed in the shell resulting in arbitrary command execution  double upqnap s advisory also detailed fixes for a second command injection flaw  cve 2023 47218  which was reported by stephen fewer  principal security researcher at rapid7  and has also been given the same 5 8 severity score the advisory itself combines both vulnerabilities and provides technical details for neither  so it s difficult to determine what the differences are from this alone rapid7 s advisory  however  provides extensive detail on how cve 2023 47218 also lies in the quick cgi component  allowing for command injection  and how it can feasibly be exploited using a specially crafted http post request details of the disclosure timeline also offered a glimpse at what appears to be a slightly ticked off rapid7

ban them for fear they re being used to help criminals steal cars the government plans to pursue  all avenues to ban devices used to steal vehicles by copying the wireless signals for remote keyless entry  such as the flipper zero   canadian public safety officials declared after a summit this week on combating auto theft the flipper is a cool piece of hardware that s able to do a lot of stuff – but anyone familiar with the miniscule device is probably already shaking their head at the idea that the device  with its sub ghz antenna  can help crooks steal cars yes  some models are vulnerable to having wireless key fob codes sniffed  but most modern cars can t be cracked by the flipper thanks to the use of rolling codes – supposing they re properly implemented  that is besides  why hack a

190,february 13  2024editor s note  cisa clarified its guidance regarding ivanti vpn appliances to explain they may be reconnected to government networks following the completion of necessary mitigations  this story has been updated to reflect cisa s feb  9 supplemental advisory on ivanti products here s what s clear about the current cybersecurity state of ivanti s vpn appliances — they have been widely vulnerable to cyberattack  and threat actors are onto the possibilities  it s up to enterprise cyber teams to decide what comes next so far  ivanti has disclosed five vpn flaws in 2024  most exploited as zero days — with two of them publicly announced weeks before patches became available  some critics  like cybersecurity researcher jake williams  see the glut of ivanti vulnerabilities  and the company s slow incident response  as an existential threat to the business williams blames ivanti s current problems on years long neglect of secure coding and security testing  to recover  ivanti would have to both overcome that technical debt  according to williams  while somehow building back trust with their customers  it s a task williams adds he s dubious ivanti will be able to pull off  i don t see how ivanti survives as an enterprise firewall brand   williams tells dark reading  a sentiment he has repeated widely on social media a more generous view of the recent spate of zero day disclosures is that it s a positive sign ivanti is taking a long  hard look at its cybersecurity  ivanti is digging deep into its own products in order to find  fix  and disclose vulnerabilities  and deserves some credit for that   john gallagher  vice president of viakoo labs says asked for comment  ivanti referred dark reading to its feb  8 blog post regarding its most recent disclosure ivanti s woes fall on cyber teamsultimately  enterprise teams will have to choose  cyber teams can following cisa s advice and disconnect ivanti vpn appliances and update before they are reconnected  or  while they re already offline for patching  they can replace ivanti appliances altogether  they also have to explain the decision to higher ups patching is a reasonable response  but ivanti s patching schedule was delayed for the aforementioned pair of zero day vulnerabilities disclosed on jan  10  cve 2024 21887 and cve 2023 46805   these ended up being under active exploit without a patch for 20 days before receiving patches on jan  30  but they came with more bad news  the ivanti update also included fixes for two additional previously undisclosed bugs  cve 2024 21888 and cve 2024 21893   the latter of which had also already been under active exploitation in the wild that was enough for cisa to issue a feb  1 mandate for federal agencies to disconnect ivanti products from their systems  cisa issued a clarification to the directive on feb  9 that ivanti vpn appliances may be reconnected to government networks once they are sufficiently patched  and in some cases  reset to factory settings a fifth ivanti vulnerability was disclosed on feb  9  tracked as cve 2024 22024  eventually  ivanti credited watchtowr with the find  though at first it claimed internal teams found the bug  sowing some confusion in bug hunter ranks further undermining confidence in ivanti security practices is the fact that the initial jan  10 bugs were originally due to get patches on jan  22 — but ivanti pushed the release date back to the 30th  these devices need their software engineered with the same kind of seriousness that this threat requires   says john bambenek  president at bambenek consulting   when you publish zero day patch schedules  you need to hit those targets  especially in a situation like this  meanwhile ivanti s persistent flaws have attracted crowds of cybercriminals  including chinese state sponsored threat actors  and cyber researcher  shadowserver  pitor kijewski confirmed to dark reading that there are at least 47 ips to date attempting to exploit the most recently disclosed ivanti vpn bug there is some confusion here too  ivanti issued the following statement to dark reading in response to the shadowserver report   we have no indication that cve 2024 22024 has been exploited in the wild  viakoo s gallagher gives ivanti poor marks for its incident response so far  ivanti’s recovery will need to address both the technical aspects of these attacks  and the trust reputational damage this has caused them   he says   on both fronts they have stumbled badly  ivanti vows to fix flaws  customers cautiousin a feb  8 advisory about the most recent connect secure and policy secure gateways bugs  ivanti assured customers it is now doing a full audit of its code  our team has been working around the clock to aggressively review all code and is singularly focused on bringing full resolution to the issues affecting ivanti connect secure  formerly pulse connect secure   ivanti policy secure and zta gateways   the company said as ivanti s cybersecurity troubles mount  the lesson for cyber teams is that reactive patching alone of edge devices isn t sufficient  according to patrick tiquet  vice president of security and architecture at keeper security  it is imperative that vendors prioritize identifying and resolving issues within their solutions   tiquet says   but organizations should regularly engage in pen testing of their own products and services to proactively find vulnerabilities before someone else does  only time will tell if ivanti will be able to woo its customers back who ve already left  and reassure the ones who have stuck around  but in the meantime  bambanek advises enterprise security teams remain cautious  if i were a ciso  i d take a pass on ivanti for a few years until they’ve proven themselves again   he adds about the author s you may also like,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.177620530128479,

192,meta says risk of account theft after phone number recycling isn t its problem to solveleaves it to carriers  promoting a complaint to irish data cops from big tech s bête noiremeta has acknowledged that phone number reuse that allows takeovers of its accounts  is a concern   but the ad biz insists the issue doesn t qualify for its bug bounty program and is a matter for telecom companies to sort out the core problem is that telecom companies recycle phone numbers that have been abandoned after a brief waiting period – at least 45 days in the us  that can become a problem because many online services require a phone number to identify users and or send one time passwords for two factor authentication  users who abandon a number  and forget to update their new number  are therefore at risk of malicious account reset attempts by whoever gets access to their old numbers  account takeovers are a common consequence this is not a new issue  in 2021  privacy researchers from princeton university published a report  pdf  on the topic titled   security and privacy risks of number recycling at mobile carriers in the united states  the report found 171 of 259 sampled numbers  were tied to existing accounts at popular websites  potentially allowing those accounts to be hijacked   it also found that 100 of those 259 were linked to leaked login credentials that would make it easier to defeat sms based multi factor authentication the findings were disclosed to telecom carriers in october 2020  and various measures were put into place to make it more difficult to hijack telecom accounts  t mobile for example published a support page advising customers who change numbers to  update your contact number on any accounts that may have your number saved  such as notifications for bank accounts  social media  etc  nonetheless  it appears this vulnerability persists with other online services that rely on mobile phone numbers for multi factor authentication enter one of big tech s least favorite activistsprivacy consultant alexander hanff  an occasional contributor to the register  noted a social media post in which a reddit user describes gaining access to a  random girl s  account by using a newly provisioned mobile phone number to login to meta s instagram service  so naturally i got curious and tested other apps   the post says   tiktok  snapchat  amazon  facebook  messenger  cash app  and doordash were all easily accessible with this new number into this random person s account  but now i m also scared because if i can do it  then the person who gets my old number can  too   isn t this like against some law or something    fcc gets tough  telcos must now tell you when your personal info is stolen  europe s largest caravan club admits wide array of personal data potentially accessed  crime gang targeted jobseekers across asia  looted two million email addresses  meta to try  cutting edge  ai detection on its platforms   asking people to add labelsthe post omits some details that clarify how this might work – the register has not verified that all the services cited above can be compromised as claimed if  for example  a facebook user changes phone numbers but fails to note that change in facebook or other accounts that use it for authentication  the recipient of the old  recycled number can try to login to the facebook account still linked to that number  doing so generally requires a password too but not having the password isn t necessarily a barrier  the phone number may be sufficient to reset the password and access it despite multi factor authentication  typically  users are sent notification of the password change to the email address associated with their account in some login flows for a new sign in  like the one used by doordash  an email address is required first  though isn t necessary thereafter  after providing an email address and clicking  continue to sign in   a user can provide that same email address or a phone number to receive a one time verification code sent in a text message that completes the login process  in this instance  controlling the phone number provides account access without need for concurrent email validation procedural variations aside  initiating a password reset without permission to hijack an online account is against the law in the us  the uk  and elsewhere  hanff wrote in his reply  in addition to being a privacy intrusion hanff subsequently tried to alert meta   i reported this under their security vulnerabilities  bug bounty  system as there is no other obvious way to report this   he told the register   obviously i am not interested in any bounty  i am just trying to get this fixed  but meta has a habit of obstructing people from contacting them  no bounty for you says metameta has rejected hanff s bug bounty report  the company s reply  provided to the register  reads as follows there are situations where phone numbers expire that are made available to someone other than the original owner  for example  if a number has a new owner and they use it to log into facebook  it could trigger a facebook password reset  if that number is still associated with the user s facebook account  the person who now has that number could then take over the account while this is a concern  this isn t considered a bug for the bug bounty program  facebook doesn t have control over telecom providers who reissue phone numbers or with users having a phone number linked to their facebook account that is no longer registered to them hanff  in a linkedin post  argued this is unacceptable  we do not say  well we know that passwords with low entropy can be hacked very quickly  but we are not responsible for people using password busting technology so we will continue to allow four character passwords consisting of only lower case letters in the first half of the alphabet    he wrote  so if you know a risk exists  the whole point of security design is to mitigate or remove those risks  not ignore them because you are not responsible for them  hanff said he has reported meta to the irish data protection commission for alleged violations of articles 5  25 and 32 of europe s general data protection regulation  those rules require responsible data handling meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment  nor did at

194,the usa department of state has announced monetary rewards of up to  10 million for information about individuals holding key positions within the hive ransomware operation it is also giving away an additional  5 million for specifics that could lead to the arrest and or conviction of any person  conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in hive ransomware activity  the multi million dollar rewards come a little over a year after a coordinated law enforcement effort covertly infiltrated and dismantled the darknet infrastructure associated with the hive ransomware as a service  raas  gang  one person with suspected ties to the group was arrested in paris in december 2023 hive  which emerged in mid 2021  targeted more than 1 500 victims in over 80 countries  netting about  100 million in illegal revenues  in november 2023  bitdefender revealed that a new ransomware group called hunters international had acquired the source code and infrastructure from hive to kick start its own efforts there is some evidence to suggest that the threat actors associated with hunters international are likely based in nigeria  specifically an individual named olowo kehinde  per information gathered by netenrich security researcher rakesh krishnan  although it could also be a fake persona adopted by the actors to cover up their true origins blockchain analytics firm chainalysis  in its 2023 review published last week  estimated that ransomware crews raked in  1 1 billion in extorted cryptocurrency payments from victims last year  compared to  567 million in 2022  all but confirming that ransomware rebounded in 2023 following a relative drop off in 2022  2023 marks a major comeback for ransomware  with record breaking payments and a substantial increase in the scope and complexity of attacks — a significant reversal from the decline observed in 2022   it said the decline in ransomware activity in 2022 has been deemed a statistical aberration  with the downturn attributed to the russo ukrainian war and the disruption of hive  what s more  the total number of victims posted on data leak sites in 2023 was 4 496  up from 3 048 in 2021 and 2 670 in 2022 palo alto networks unit 42  in its own analysis of ransomware gangs  public listings of victims on dark web sites  called out manufacturing as the most impacted industry vertical in 2023  followed by profession and legal services  high technology  retail  construction  and healthcare sectors while the law enforcement action prevented approximately  130 million in ransom payments to hive  it s said that the takedown also  likely affected the broader activities of hive affiliates  potentially lessening the number of additional attacks they could carry out   in total  the effort may have averted at least  210 4 million in payments adding to the escalation in the regularity  scope  and volume of attacks  last year also witnessed a surge in new entrants and offshoots  a sign that the ransomware ecosystem is attracting a steady stream of new players who are attracted by the prospect of high profits and lower barriers to entry cyber insurance provider corvus said the number of active ransomware gangs registered a  significant  34  increase between q1 and q4 2023  growing from 35 to 47 either due to fracturing and rebranding or other actors getting hold of leaked encryptors  twenty five new ransomware groups emerged in 2023  the frequency of rebranding  especially among actors behind the biggest and most notorious strains  is an important reminder that the ransomware ecosystem is smaller than the large number of strains would make it appear   chainalysis said besides a notable shift to big game hunting – which refers to the tactic of targeting very large companies to extract hefty ransoms – ransom payments are being steadily routed through cross chain bridges  instant exchangers  and gambling services  indicating that e crime groups are slowly moving away from centralized exchanges and mixers in pursuit of new avenues for money laundering in november 2023  the usa treasury department imposed sanctions against sinbad  a virtual currency mixer that has been put to use by the north korea linked lazarus group to launder ill gotten proceeds  some of the other sanctioned mixers include blender  tornado cash  and chipmixer the pivot to big game hunting is also a consequence of companies increasingly refusing to settle  as the number of victims who chose to pay dropped to a new low of 29  in the last quarter of 2023  according to data from coveware  another factor contributing to higher ransomware numbers in 2023 was a major shift in threat actors  use of vulnerabilities   corvus said  highlighting cl0p s exploitation of flaws in fortra goanywhere and progress moveit transfer  if malware  like infostealers  provide a steady drip of new ransomware victims  then a major vulnerability is like turning on a faucet  with some vulnerabilities  relatively easy access to thousands of victims can materialize seemingly overnight  cybersecurity company recorded future revealed that ransomware groups  weaponization of security vulnerabilities falls into two clear categories  vulnerabilities that have only been exploited by one or two groups and those that have been widely exploited by multiple threat actors  magniber has uniquely focused on microsoft vulnerabilities  with half of its unique exploits focusing on windows smart screen   it noted   cl0p has uniquely and infamously focused on file transfer software from accellion  solarwinds  and moveit  alphv has uniquely focused on data backup software from veritas and veeam  revil has uniquely focused on server software from oracle  atlassian  and kaseya  the continuous adaptation observed among cybercrime crews is also evidenced in the uptick in darkgate and pikabot infections following the takedown of the qakbot malware network  which had been the preferred initial entry pathway into target networks for ransomware deployment chainalysis further said it found a  correlation  between inflows to initial access broker  iab  wallets and a spike in

195,fcc gets tough  telcos must now tell you when your personal info is stolenyep  cell carriers didn t have to do this beforethe fcc s updated reporting requirements mean telcos in america will have just seven days to officially disclose that a criminal has broken into their systems after releasing a proposed rule in early january and giving the industry 30 days to respond  the fcc s final rule was published today  it solidifies what the agency proposed a little more than a month ago  and what was teased in early 2022 when fcc chairwoman jessica rosenworcel drafted initial changes to the commission s 16 year old security  breach  reporting duties along with requiring that attacks are reported to the fcc within seven days of a telco discovering them  the same deadline now exists to report any data leaks to the fbi and us secret service as well  as the fcc planned  the new rule also eliminates the mandatory seven day waiting period for reporting break ins to consumers the fcc now  requires carriers to notify customers of breaches of covered data without unreasonable delay … and in no case more than 30 days following reasonable determination of a breach   reasonable determination  of a data blurt is further defined as  when the carrier has information indicating that it is more likely than not that there was a breach  and  does not mean reaching a conclusion regarding every fact surrounding a data security incident that may constitute a breach  in other words  if customers are affected then they had better be notified post haste the fcc has additionally extended the scope of data exposure types that telecom customers must be notified of  prior to the passage of the new rule customers only had to be told if customer proprietary network information  cpni  was exposed to the world cpni  for those unfamiliar  is all the data a cellular carrier retains about phone calls and service agreements   i e   the data that appears on a bill  personal identifiable information  pii  wasn t included in previous reporting requirements  meaning carriers whose customer records were exposed  didn t have to tell customers if cpni wasn t accessed  without an fcc rule requiring breach notifications for the above categories of pii  there would be no requirement in federal law that telecommunications carriers report non cpni breaches to their customers   the fcc said of the new rule starting now  names  government id numbers  data used for authentication purposes  email addresses passwords and biometric data is all included in the fcc s reporting requirements  dissociated data  if linkable to an individual using other data criminals accessed during a break in  has to be reported as well the new rules add an exception for customer notifications as well  if a carrier can  determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur   then it doesn t have to inform subscribers of the incident along with increased reporting rules for the content of data leaks  the new rule also expands the fcc s definition of  breach  to include  inadvertent access  use or disclosure of customer information  inadvertent  much like the exposure of 63k employee records verizon reported last week luckily for verizon it won t have to worry about falling foul of the new rules  which don t go into effect until march 13 telecom relay service providers  which provide assistance for hearing impaired phone users  will be covered under the new rule as well here a breach  there a breach  everywhere a breach reportthe fcc s updated directive is the latest in a string of federal agency breach reporting requirements  with rules passed by the ftc and sec set to go into effect later this year  and federal contractors getting their own set of newly proposed it security breach reporting rules too as has been the case with those other rules  the fcc s requirements  when formally proposed last month  ran up against opposition   future of america s cyber

nabbed in massive breach  40  of it security pros say they ve been told not to report a data leakper the fcc  the cellular telecommunications industry association raised an objection on several grounds  including that the fcc rule would create a system of dual jurisdiction between the fcc and ftc once the latter s rule goes into effect as has been the case with objections raised to the wide and varying data leak reporting requirements now enacted by the us federal government  the fcc said it finds industry objections  unpersuasive  congress has even raised objections to some of the new reporting rules  with bills introduced in the house and senate to overturn the sec s four day reporting deadline for data break ins that could have a  material  effect on a company s finances and  by extension  its investors the feds were generally dismissive of the complaints  with the biden administration saying it would veto any attempts to undo the sec s reporting rules industry figures  and congressional representatives  have pointed to the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency s forthcoming rules for security breach requirements as a potential inter agency standard  it s not clear whether cisa s rules  a draft of which is expected to be published next month  will harmonize standards or otherwise eliminate the need for companies covered under multiple rules to make

197,february 13  2024bank of america has warned customers of a leak of their sensitive data that occurred due to a ransomware attack that breached the environment at technology partner infosys mccamish systems  ims  last autumn  it s an incident that once again highlights the importance of securing access to data and environments across third party systems at least 57 028 customers were affected in the breach  which occurred when  when an unauthorized third party accessed ims systems  resulting in the non availability of certain ims applications   according to a data breach disclosure form filed in maine by ims  and a separate letter  pdf  sent on behalf of bank of america to affected customers  the financial institution serves about 69 million clients across more than 35 countries globally the form and letter offer different timelines for when the breach occurred  the disclosure firm claims it occurred on oct  29  with ims discovering it the following day  the letter says it occurred  on or around nov  3  no matter  the attack caused some unspecified systems in ims  technology environment — which provides insurance process management solutions and services — to be rendered unavailable  the attack also exposed sensitive data — including the combination of people s names or other personal identifiers with their social security numbers — from bank of america deferred compensation plans  for which the company provides services however  ims noted that it  is unlikely that we will be able to determine with certainty what personal information was accessed as a result of this incident   though it  may have included  not only people s names and ssns  but also addresses  business email addresses  dates of birth  and other account info lockbit claims responsibilitya few days later on nov  4  the lockbit ransomware gang posted an ad for the sale of stolen data on its dark web site claiming to be from more than 2 000 ims systems that were encrypted by the threat actor in an attack  according to a screenshot posted by  darkwebinformer on x  formerly twitter  and flagged in a published report  the post listed a deadline of nov  9 for the company to pay ransom before it would post the leaked data  it s unclear at this time if that occurred or if the ransom was paid ims informed bank of america on nov  24 that data concerning deferred compensation plans serviced by the bank may have been compromised  though bank of america systems were not affected by the breach ims retained a third party forensic firm to investigate and assist with the company s recovery plan in response to the incident   which included containing and remediating malicious activity  rebuilding systems  and enhancing response capabilities   the company said in its letter to customers  to date  ims has found no evidence of continued threat actor access  tooling  or persistence in the ims environment   according to ims bank of america said it is not aware that any data exposed in the breach has been misused  even so  the bank is providing affected customers a complimentary two year membership in an identity theft protection service provided by experian identityworks to help them protect their data neither ims nor bank of america immediately responded to requests for comment about the incident on feb  13 managing third party cyber riskaccessing a company s data via that company s partner or customer has become all too common for organizations  and security experts and technology providers alike have offered a range of suggestions and solutions for this third party exposure — including risk management and risk assessment strategies — to mitigate these threats however  the problem persists  demonstrating  that the complexity of a typical organization s digital landscape  completely protecting against all forms of risk is close to impossible   notes roger neal  head of product at apona security  in an email to dark reading he suggests that organizations consider not only risk management or  assessment solutions  but also demand a software bill of materials  sbom  from all third party vendors to better assess and manage vulnerabilities so they can take control before an attack even occurs  while the breach s specifics…are yet to be fully disclosed  it s possible that early detection of vulnerable components might have mitigated or prevented this incident   neal posits another potential strategy to protect against such breaches could be  to require hosting third party services on premises  thereby ensuring more

worked for the australian taxation office  ato  have been investigated – and some prosecuted – for participating in a tax refund scam promoted on facebook and tiktok the extent of the scam was revealed on monday in an audit of the ato s management and oversight of fraud control arrangements for the goods and services tax  gst  – australia s equivalent of a value added or sales tax down under  as elsewhere  businesses can claim refunds for the sales tax they pay on their own purchases the world bank ranks australia as the seventh easiest country on earth in which to start a business  in part because one step in the process – obtaining an australian business number  abn  – can be accomplished online with very little effort  an abn is also one of the few requirements to register for gst refunds  the tools to request a refund are also online  and easy to use – even this vulture managed to employ them  entirely legitimately  for a few years the scam promoted in online ads detailed a means of securing a loan from the ato – an outright lie  as australian tax authorities are not notably more generous than others around the world  those who responded to the scam ads were advised on methods to create a fake business  fraudulently apply for an abn  and then lodge false claims for a gst refund the scam worked spectacularly well for a time  the audit into the ato found a 2 billion

ato received increased numbers of gst fraud tipoffs  and from december 2021 financial institutions sent an elevated volume of alerts regarding suspicious gst and income tax refunds by january 2022 the ato was tracking so many cases that it knew it did not have enough people to handle them all  in april of the same year  470 people were allocated to address the mess  and the effort was named operation protego some of the fraudulent claims were lodged by stolen identities as operation protego continued  150 ato officials were identified as worthy of investigation the ato yesterday described  the majority  of those investigated as  former contractors or ex employees  who  were not working with the ato at the time they are suspected of committing operation protego fraud  some of the ato officials were themselves the victims of identity theft and were not perpetrators but a dozen ato staff were found to have committed fraud while working for the tax office  sanctions on that dirty dozen included termination of contract  administrative action  and criminal prosecutions many others were prosecuted as a result of operation protego  the ato has shared details of one perp  who reactivated an abn for a jewelry and silver manufacturing business and then lodged 63 false gst claims that netted a 73 650   47 500  – and 20 months jail  other false claims discovered during operation protego sought millions in gst refunds an resulted in sentences of seven and a half years australia s serious financial crime taskforce continues to pursue those who promoted the scheme

intended  the audit also rated the ato s gst fraud detection methods  largely appropriate  – but at the same time detailed a classic organizational data flow mess   registers of controls used to detect potential gst fraud are dispersed across ato business lines and the ato does not maintain a centralized register   the audit found   the dispersed nature of gst controls means the ato relies on

june 2021  the latest edition of the report delves into the impact of artificial intelligence  ai  on identity management  security challenges  economic uncertainties  and the growing reliance on managed service providers  msps  in it operations jumpcloud commissioned this biannual survey of sme it admins to gain unique insights into the day to day experiences of it professionals who power and secure operations without enterprise level budgets and staff  the most recent survey results  polled from admins in the usa  u k   and india  indicates how quickly ai has impacted identity management and highlights that it professionals have both big hopes and big fears in their response to it  with a strong majority of respondents both planning or actively implementing within the next year and advocating for ai investment  it leaders clearly see potential benefits from deploying ai in their workplaces  but it admins report notable concerns around their organizations’ current ability to secure against related threats—and personal concerns about ai’s impact on their career “while ai is the buzzword that grabs headlines  it’s security that remains a paramount concern for it teams given the increasing sophistication of external threats and rising regulatory pressures ” said rajat bhargava  ceo  jumpcloud  “and it’s only getting worse  we found that 56  of admins agree that they’re more concerned about their organization’s security posture now than they were six months ago  to reduce this complexity and anxiety  organizations should look toward solutions that offer a unified  open identity and it management approach  this can enhance security  mitigate operational disruptions  and alleviate admin burnout  the results of the jumpcloud q1 2024 sme it trends report are

optimism and concernsa vast majority of admins see ai as a net positive for their organization and think their organization is approaching ai at the right pace—though this optimism is tempered by significant concerns about ai’s potential impact on security and individual careers topline ai findings include organizations are actively planning for ai  just 13  of organizations do not currently have any plans to implement ai initiatives and 76  agree their organization should be investing in ai admins optimistic about ai  79  report that ai will be a net positive  versus just 6  who see it as a net negative  most admins agree their organizations are approaching ai adoption at exactly the right speed  55    roughly equal amounts think they are moving too quickly  22   or too slow  19   it teams are wary about ai’s potential for organizational security and career  62  agree that ai is outpacing their organization’s ability to protect against threats overall and nearly half  45   worry about ai’s impact on their job uncertainty for itthe start of 2024 finds smes continuing to wrestle with economic uncertainties and it teams unsure about what that means for their organizations and their operations topline it management findings include concerns about layoffs persist  57  of organizations have experienced layoffs over the last year  just over a quarter  27   haven’t experienced layoffs and don’t expect any over the next six months admins worried about the impact of budget cuts on security  72  agree that any cuts to their security budget will increase organizational risk  and 56  are more concerned about their organizations’ security posture than they were six months ago licensing costs increase while compliance mandates expand  88  report vendors

209,cybersecurity researchers have found that it s possible for threat actors to exploit a well known utility called command not found to recommend their own rogue packages and compromise systems running ubuntu operating system  while  command not found  serves as a convenient tool for suggesting installations for uninstalled commands  it can be inadvertently manipulated by attackers through the snap repository  leading to deceptive recommendations of malicious packages   cloud security firm aqua said in a report shared with the hacker news installed by default on ubuntu systems  command not found suggests packages to install in interactive bash sessions when attempting to run commands that are not available  the suggestions include both the advanced packaging tool  apt  and snap packages when the tool uses an internal database    var lib command not found commands db   to suggest apt packages  it relies on the  advise snap  command to suggest snaps that provide the given command thus  should an attacker be able to game this system and have their malicious package recommended by the command not found package  it could pave the way for software supply chain attacks aqua said it found a security loophole wherein the alias mechanism can be exploited by the threat actor to potentially register the corresponding snap name associated with an alias and trick users into installing the malicious package what s more  an attacker could claim the snap name related to an apt package and upload a malicious snap  which then ends up being suggested when a user types in the command on their terminal  the maintainers of the  jupyter notebook  apt package had not claimed the corresponding snap name   aqua security researcher ilay goldman said   this oversight left a window of opportunity for an attacker to claim it and upload a malicious snap named  jupyter notebook   to make matters worse  the command not found utility suggests the snap package above the legitimate apt package for jupyter notebook  misleading users into installing the fake snap package as many as 26  of the apt package commands are vulnerable to impersonation by malicious actors  aqua noted  presenting a substantial security risk  as they could be registered under an attacker s account a third category entails typosquatting attacks in which typographical errors made by users  e g   ifconfigg instead of ifconfig  are leveraged to suggest bogus snap packages by registering a fraudulent package with the name  ifconfigg  in such a case  command not found  would mistakenly match it to this incorrect command and recommend the malicious snap  bypassing the suggestion for  net tools  altogether   aqua researchers explained describing the abuse of the command not found utility to recommend counterfeit packages as a pressing concern  the company is urging users to verify the source of a package before installation and check the maintainers  credibility developers of apt and snap packages have also been advised to register the associated snap name for their commands to prevent them from being misused  it remains uncertain how extensively these capabilities have been exploited  underscoring the urgency for heightened vigilance and proactive defense strategies   aqua said ,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.15669997036457062, 'security updates and patches': 0.045966241508722305, 'emerging threats and attack techniques': 0.5608848333358765, 'regulatory changes and compliance': 0.03243264928460121, 'data breaches and security incidents': 0.06428997218608856, 'news and industry updates': 0.13234275579452515, 'marketing': 0.007383603602647781}"

and monitor administrator accountsthe threat actor gained access to the network via compromised administrator accounts that did not have mfa enabled  the compromiseduser2 global domain administrator account could have enabled the threat actor to move laterally from the on premises environment to the azure tenant  in response to the incident  the victim organization removed administrator privileges foruser2  additionally  the victim organization disabled unnecessary administrator accounts and enabled mfa for all administrator accounts  to prevent similar compromises  cisa and ms isac recommend the following   review current administrator accounts to determine their necessity and only maintain administrator accounts that are essential for network management  this will reduce the attack surface and focus efforts on the security and monitoring of necessary accounts   restrict the use of multiple administrator accounts for one user   create separate administrator accounts for on premises and azure environments to segment access   implement the principle of least privilege to decrease threat actor’s ability to access key network resources  enable just in time and just enough access for administrator accounts to elevate the minimum necessary privileges for a limited time to complete tasks   use phishing resistant multifactor authentication  mfa   cpg 2 h   e g   security

compromise  cisa and ms isac recommend the following   establish policy and procedure for the prompt removal of unnecessary accounts and groups from the enterprise  especially privileged accounts  organizations should implement a robust and continuous user management process to ensure accounts of offboarded employees are removed and can no longer access the network   maintain a robust asset management policy through comprehensive documentation of assets  tracking current version information to maintain awareness of outdated software  and mapping assets to business and critical functions   determine the need and functionality of assets that require public internet exposure  cpg 1 a    follow a routine patching cycle for all operating systems  applications  and software  including all third party software  to mitigate the potential for exploitation   restrict personal devices from connecting to the network  personal devices are not subject to the same group policies and security measures as domain joined devices evaluate tenant settingsby default  in azure ad all users can register and manage all aspects of applications they create  users can also determine and approve what organizational data and services the application can access  these default settings can enable a threat actor to access sensitive information and move laterally in the network  in addition  users who create an azure ad automatically become the global administrator for that tenant  this could allow a threat actor to escalate privileges to execute malicious actions  cisa and ms isac recommend the following   evaluate current user permissions in the azure tenant to restrict potentially harmful permissions including   restrict users’ ability to register applications  by default  all users in azure ad can register and manage the applications they create and approve the data and services the application can access  if this is exploited  a threat actor can access sensitive information and move laterally in the network   restrict non administrators from creating tenants  any user who creates an azure ad automatically becomes the global administrator for that tenant  this creates an opportunity for a threat actor to escalate privileges to the highest privileged account   restrict access to the azure ad portal to administrators only  users without administrative privileges cannot change settings  however  they can view user info  group info  device details  and user privileges  this would allow a threat actor to gather valuable information for malicious activities create a forensically ready organization  collect access  and security focused logs  e g   intrusion detection systems intrusion prevention systems  firewall  data loss prevention  and virtual private network

help federal civilian executive branch  fceb  agencies to verify that a m365 tenant configuration conforms to a minimal viable secure configuration baseline  although the scuba assessment tool was developed for fceb  other organizations can benefit from its output  cisa and ms isac recommend the following   use tools that identify attack paths  this will enable defenders to identify common attack paths used by threat actors and shut them down before they are exploited   review the security recommendations list provided by microsoft 365 defender  focus remediation on critical vulnerabilities on endpoints that are essential to mission execution and contain sensitive data evaluate conditional access policiesconditional access policies require users who want to access a resource to complete an action  conditional access policies also account for common signals  such as user or group memberships  ip location information  device  application  and risky sign in behavior identified through integration with azure ad identity protection   review current conditional access policies to determine if changes are necessary reset all passwords and establish secure password policiesin response to the incident  the victim organization reset passwords for all users   employ strong password management alongside other attribute based information  such as device information  time of access  user history  and geolocation data  set a password policy to require complex passwords for all users  minimum of 16 characters  and enforce this new requirement as user passwords expire  cpg 2 a   cpg 2 b   cpg 2 c    store credentials in a secure manner  such as with a credential manager  vault  or other privileged account management solution  cpg 2 l    for products that come with default passwords  ask vendors how they plan to eliminate default passwords  as highlighted in cisa’s secure by design alert  how manufacturers can protect customers by eliminating default passwords mitigations for vendorscisa recommends that vendors incorporate secure by design principles and tactics into their practices  limiting the impact of threat actor techniques and strengthening the secure posture for their customers   prioritize secure by default configurations  such as eliminating default passwords and providing high quality audit logs to customers with no additional configuration  at no extra charge  secure by default configurations should be prioritized to eliminate the need for customer implementation of hardening guidance   immediately identify  mitigate  and

211,february 14  2024the sophisticated bumblebee loader is back in the threat landscape hive after a four month hiatus  with a new email campaign targeting thousands of organizations in the us bumblebee  an initial access loader used by multiple cybercriminal groups to drop various payloads like infostealers  banking trojans  and post compromise tools  first appeared on the scene in march 2022  until last october  threat actors relied on it heavily as a favored malware loader — and then it disappeared from researchers  radar the loader was back in a campaign observed this month by the proofpoint threat research team  according to a blog post published tuesday  the campaign employs several thousand emails with the subject  voicemail february   sent from the sender  info quarlesaa   com  and containing malicious microsoft onedrive urls these urls lead to a word file with names such as  releaseevans 96 docm  that spoof the consumer electronics company humane  the attack vector eventually uses a powershell command to download and run a bumblebee dll file as an entry to further malicious activity  the researchers found the return of the loader is a harbinger of things to come  proofpoint researchers noted  as it  aligns with a surge of cybercriminal threat activity after a notable absence of many threat actors and malware  2024  has started off with a bang for cybercriminal threat actors  with activity returning to very high levels after a temporary winter lull   the researchers said   proofpoint researchers continue to observe new  creative attack chains  attempts to bypass detections  and updated malware from many threat actors and unattributed threat clusters   adding that they expect this flurry of activity to continue until summer other malicious groups returning to action after a break include groups that the researchers track as post exploitation operator ta582  aviation and aerospace targeting actor ta2541  and email campaigns delivered by ta571 that deliver the darkgate malware  among others bumblebee malware s new and noteworthy flight paththere are a couple of key aspects of the campaign that set it apart from previous attacks using bumblebee  for instance  the campaign uses vba macro enabled documents  a tactic that s rarely used these days by threat actors since microsoft began blocking macros by default in 2022 to thwart malicious activity  the researchers said in the most recent campaign  the word document used macros to create a script in the windows temporary directory  which the macro then executed by using the  wscript  utility  inside the dropped temporary file was a powershell command that downloaded and executed the next stage from a remote server  stored in a file called “update ver   the next stage was another powershell command  which in turn downloaded and ran the bumblebee dll interestingly  the attack chains used in bumblebee s pre hiatus campaigns were significantly different  the researchers noted  previous campaigns sent emails that contained urls leading to the download of a dll which  if executed  started bumblebee  or the emails contained html attachments that leveraged html smuggling to drop a rar file that  if executed  exploited the winrar flaw cve 2023 38831 to install bumblebee other previous bumblebee campaigns leveraged emails with zipped  password protected vbs attachments which  if executed  used powershell to download and execute the loader  or emails that contained zipped lnk files to download an executable file that started bumblebee  out of the nearly 230 bumblebee campaigns identified since march 2022  only five used any macro laden content  four campaigns used xl4 macros  and one used vba macros   according to the researchers defenders bewarewhile proofpoint has not attributed the recent bumblebee campaign to any tracked threat actor — though the use of onedrive urls and sender address appear to align with previous ta579 activities  however  the firm included a list of indicators of compromise  ioc  to aid threat hunting the researchers also urged organizations to be on alert for the malicious email campaign hallmarks noted above  and said that they have assessed with  high confidence  that bumblebee is being used  as an initial access facilitator to deliver follow on payloads such as ransomware  organizations can also employ basic security best practices to avoid compromise by malicious email campaigns  such as conducting employee training to help people identify phishing and other targeted scams  and implementing email security

exploiting this bug  nor how widespread the attacks are – microsoft rarely provides any insight into either of these things windows uses mark of the web as a security feature to identify files downloaded from the internet  which when opened triggers a smartscreen check  this smartscreen bypass bug could allow an attacker to  inject code into smartscreen and potentially gain code execution

attempted to abuse openai for help developing malicious code  and researching stealth tactics iran s crimson sandstorm  tortoiseshell  imperial kitten  yellow liderc  is using openai to develop

content generation  and researching publicly available information on vulnerabilities  as well as experts  think tanks  and government organizations concerned with defense issues and its nuclear weapons program ai isn t game changing  yet if these many malicious uses of ai seem useful  but not science fiction level cool  there s a reason why  threat actors that are effective enough to be tracked by microsoft are likely already proficient at writing software   joseph thacker  principal ai engineer and security researcher at appomni explains   generative ai is amazing  but it s mostly helping humans be more efficient rather than making breakthroughs  i believe those threat actors are using llms to write code  like malware  faster  but it s not noticeably impactful because they already had malware  they still have malware  it s possible they re able to be more efficient  but at the end of the day  they aren t doing anything new yet  though cautious not to overstate its impact  thacker warns that ai still offers advantages for attackers   bad actors will likely be able to deploy malware at a larger scale or on systems they previously didn t have support for  llms are pretty good at translating code from one language or architecture to another  so i can see them converting their malicious code into new languages they previously weren t proficient in   he says further   if a threat actor found a novel use case  it could still be in stealth and not detected by these companies yet  so it s not impossible  i have seen fully autonomous ai agents that can  hack  and find real vulnerabilities  so if any bad actors have developed something similar  that would be dangerous  for those reasons he adds  simply  that  companies can remain vigilant  keep doing the

218,bumblebee malware wakes from hibernation  forgets what year it is  attacks with macrostrying to break in with malicious word documents  how very 2015 of youthe bumblebee malware loader seemingly vanished from the internet last october  but it s back and   oddly   relying on a vintage vector to try and gain access first spotted in 2022 by researchers at proofpoint – who identified it as an apparent replacement for bazarloader – bumblebee was originally used by high profile ransomware groups including russia linked conti now it has been spotted buzzing back to life  but it s using a  significantly different  attack chain this time – relying on malicious vba macros  of all things  which suggests it might not be in the hands of the same skilled operators who created it this latest bumblebee campaign has been targeting organizations in the us with emails using the subject line  voicemail february  and sent from info quarlesaa com the quarlesaa domain appears to belong to an actual business  which is reflected in the sample email lure included in the report  we ve asked to see if the owner is aware that its email system is being used to send malicious emails but haven t heard back contained in the email is a link to a onedrive url  where a microsoft word document is  the doc is entirely unrelated to the sender – the sample shows a mission statement for humane  developer of an ai powered pin – but has the malicious macro embedded within it s been more than a year since microsoft updated its products to block vba macros by default in a bid to cut off their use as a malicious attack vector  as the security team itself noted last may  the cyber criminal ecosystem underwent a  monumental shift  after redmond s decision – quickly moving to different types of attacks not so this latest campaign  which puts it at odds with other bumblebee flights  out of nearly 230 uses of bumblebee since march 2022  proofpoint said only five campaigns used macros – four of which relied on xl4 in excel  while just one relied on vba the rest of the intrusion attempts have used more evolved tactics – like malicious dlls  html smuggling to drop rar files  lnk files and zipped vbs attachments  those are more akin to tactics exotic lily – an initial access broker tracked by google s threat analysis group – was using with bumblebee in 2022 if  somehow  a victim s system had re enabled word macros by default and this bumblebee chain managed to trigger – which the security group told the register it hasn t actually seen in the wild – the macro would create a script in the windows temp directory that ran a series of powershell commands to download and run the bumblebee dll  we cannot say what the follow on payload would be in this campaign  however historically proofpoint has previously observed bumblebee dropping cobalt strike  shellcode  and sliver among other malware   proofpoint senior threat intelligence analyst selena larson told us in an emailed statement this one should be easy to spotindicators of compromise are included in the report on this bumblebee resurgence campaign  but let s be realistic – such an outmoded attack shouldn t be a threat anymore  not to mention the mish mash of themes in the email and the very basic malicious attachment  the url in the email went to a document that was not related to a voicemail theme  which may appear unusual or possibly malicious to an end user   larson told us   organizations should train users to recognize potentially suspicious activity based on commonly observed themes and lures  and report to security teams when observed    malware loader lowdown  the big 3 responsible for 80  of attacks so far this year  microsoft took its macros and went home  so miscreants turned to windows lnk files  google password resets not enough to stop these info stealing malware strains  malvertising attacks are distributing  net malware loadersbeyond that  the usual advice of keeping windows and microsoft office installations up to date applies  as does making sure macros are disabled by default and ensuring none of your savvier users have taken it upon themselves to re enable them unsurprisingly  proofpoint doesn t think this campaign is linked to a tracked threat actor – despite the fact that the voicemail lure  use of onedrive  and sender email address align with previous activity from the north korean aligned ta579  which has been behind previous bumblebee campaigns regardless of this threat  proofpoint said bumblebee s return is indicative of a surge in threat actor activity so far in 2024  even if this campaign is a bit janky  they won t all be  proofpoint researchers continue to observe new  creative attack chains  attempts to bypass detections  and updated malware from many threat actors and unattributed threat clusters   it warned   researchers are expecting this high operational tempo to continue until the anticipated summer threat actor

percent of its customers had their details stolen from the british utilities giant during a january cyberattack this is on top of the undisclosed proportion of current and former staff that are also said to be affected  the biz  which provides water and wastewater services to millions  will be writing to those whose data was stolen directly in the coming days the announcement comes just shy of four weeks after reg readers were first to know about the intrusion  which was claimed by the black basta ransomware group it should be said that southern water still hasn t confirmed ransomware was involved in the incident however  it was fairly evident from the outset that both staff and customers were affected by the data breach  in typical black basta fashion  it dumped a plethora of the data it stole online  including identity documents and hr files  among others the information revealed in this initial data dump was enough to verify through simple means that the documents were genuine and affected both customers and employees in a letter sent to customers already  seen by el reg  southern water said names  dates of birth  national insurance numbers  bank account numbers  sort codes  and payment reference numbers may have been stolen  this data was all visible online from the beginning it s understood that customers will be sent different versions of the letter depending on the data believed to be stolen  affected individuals have also been offered a free 12 month experian identity plus membership for credit monitoring per the utility s website  it provides water services to 2 5 million customers and wastewater services to more than 4 7 million customers  it means that if the quoted 5 percent to 10 percent range is accurate  then hundreds of thousands of customers will potentially be receiving letters from the company soon  informing them that their data was stolen offering some comfort  southern water s latest statement confirmed that the third party investigators called in to analyze the incident found no new evidence that data was further published online  we are very sorry that this has happened   the biz said  throughout this process we have been working

224,the landscape of cybersecurity in financial services is undergoing a rapid transformation  cybercriminals are exploiting advanced technologies and methodologies  making traditional security measures obsolete  the challenges are compounded for community banks that must safeguard sensitive financial data against the same level of sophisticated threats as larger institutions  but often with more limited resources the finserv threat landscaperecent trends show an alarming increase in sophisticated cyber attacks  cybercriminals now deploy advanced techniques like deep fake technology and ai powered attacks  making it increasingly difficult for banks to differentiate between legitimate and malicious activities  these developments necessitate a shift towards more sophisticated and adaptive cybersecurity measures  take these industry statistics  for example   financial firms report 703 cyberattack attempts per week 1  on average  270 attacks  entailing unauthorized access of data  applications  networks  or devices  occurred in financial services  an increase of 31  compared with the prior year 2  on average  financial services businesses take an average of 233 days to detect and contain a data breach 3  43  of senior bank executives don t believe their bank is adequately equipped to protect customer data  privacy  and assets in the event of a cyberattack 4  the average data breach cost in financial services is  5 72 million per incident 5state sponsored cyberattacks also pose a unique threat to the financial sector  these attacks are often highly sophisticated and well funded  aimed at destabilizing financial systems or stealing sensitive economic information  community banks must be prepared to defend against these high level threats  which require a different approach than conventional cybercriminal activities similarly  in recent times  there has been a concerning trend where major service providers catering to small medium sized banks  such as fis  fiserv  and jack henry  have become prime targets for cyber attacks  targeting these service providers allows threat actors to widen their net and make their attempts more efficient  as compromising a single service provider can potentially provide access to multiple small banks  this underscores the critical importance of strong vendor management governance  community banks must be prepared to defend against these high level threats  which require a different approach than conventional cybercriminal activities proactive measures can be taken to overcome the threats facing the finserv industry  companies like armorpoint provide complimentary cybersecurity workshops where they have seasoned cybersecurity experts identify specific security gaps and produce recommendations to mitigate those risks top 5 finserv cybersecurity challenges and how to overcome them1  advanced cloud security strategiescloud computing  with its numerous benefits of scalability  flexibility  and cost effectiveness  is increasingly being adopted by financial institutions  however  this shift introduces specific security concerns that can be challenging to manage  the complexity of cloud security stems from the need to protect data across diverse and dynamic environments  in the cloud  data often moves across various services and geographies  making traditional perimeter based security approaches less effective  additionally  the shared responsibility model in cloud computing can lead to ambiguity in security roles and responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the bank to address these challenges  banks must adopt advanced cloud security strategies  this involves implementing comprehensive data encryption to protect data at rest and in transit  and robust identity and access management systems to control who can access what data and under what conditions  zero trust security models  where trust is never assumed and verification is required from everyone trying to access resources in the network  are increasingly vital  understanding the nuances of different cloud environments—public  private  and hybrid—is also key to tailoring security measures effectively 2  ransomware  beyond basic defenseransomware attacks in the financial sector have become increasingly sophisticated  leveraging tactics like  ransomware as a service   raas  to target institutions  the evolving nature of ransomware  combined with the high value of financial data  makes these institutions particularly vulnerable  traditional defense strategies are often inadequate in the face of such advanced threats  which can bypass standard security measures and encrypt critical data  causing operational disruptions and financial losses banks need to implement a multi layered defense strategy against ransomware  this includes advanced threat intelligence systems that can provide real time insights into emerging threats and vulnerabilities  regular security audits are crucial to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the bank s cybersecurity infrastructure  additionally  proactive threat hunting teams can play a critical role in identifying and neutralizing threats before they materialize  providing an additional layer of defense against ransomware attacks 3  comprehensive vendor risk managementfinancial institutions increasingly rely on third party vendors for a range of services  from cloud computing to customer relationship management  each vendor relationship introduces potential cybersecurity risks  as vendors may have access to or manage sensitive bank data  managing these risks is complicated by the differing security postures and practices of various vendors  making it challenging to ensure consistent security standards across all third party relationships effective vendor risk management goes beyond initial security assessments and requires continuous monitoring and evaluation of vendor security practices  regular security audits of vendors are essential to ensure they adhere to agreed upon security standards and practices  integrating vendor risk management into the bank s overall cybersecurity strategy ensures a unified approach to security  reducing the likelihood of vendor related security breaches 4  regulatory compliance  navigating a complex landscapethe regulatory landscape for cybersecurity in the financial sector is intricate and constantly evolving  banks are required to comply with a wide range of international  national  and regional regulations  each with its own set of requirements and penalties for non compliance  navigating this complex landscape is challenging  as banks must continually adapt their cybersecurity strategies to meet these evolving requirements to effectively navigate this landscape  community banks must develop a deep understanding of relevant regulations  such as the gbla  pci dss  sox  and more  this involves establishing a dedicated compliance team  or even utilizing a virtual chief information security officer  vciso   responsible for staying abreast of regulatory changes and ensuring that the bank s cybersecurity practices align with these requirements  regular training and awareness programs for all staff are also crucial to ensure widespread understanding and adherence to compliance requirements 5  bridging the cybersecurity talent gapthe cybersecurity talent gap poses a significant challenge for financial institutions  the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats requires skilled professionals who are up to date with the latest technologies and strategies  however  there is a shortage of such professionals in the market  making it difficult for banks to recruit and retain the talent needed to effectively manage their cybersecurity risks banks must adopt creative solutions to bridge this talent gap  developing internal training programs can help upskill existing staff  making them capable of handling more complex cybersecurity tasks  collaborating with educational institutions to develop tailored cybersecurity curriculums can help create a pipeline of skilled professionals  additionally  leveraging ai and automation for routine security tasks can free up human resources for more complex and strategic cybersecurity challenges  optimizing the use of available talent furthermore  another viable strategy for addressing the talent gap is outsourcing  financial institutions can consider outsourcing security operations talent  partnering with specialized firms to provide expert cybersecurity services  this approach allows banks to access a pool of seasoned professionals who can monitor  detect  and respond to security threats effectively  additionally  outsourcing executive level insights  such as a virtual chief information security officer  vciso   can provide strategic guidance and governance to strengthen the bank s overall cybersecurity posture  by outsourcing specific talent needs  banks can bridge the talent gap more effectively while maintaining a strong focus on cybersecurity excellence armorpoint has recently released a security maturity self assessment  take the 15 question quiz to determine the gaps in your security posture three steps to implement a robust cybersecurity frameworkan integrated approach to cybersecurity is imperative for effectively managing these diverse challenges  this involves creating a cohesive framework that combines advanced technology solutions  thorough policies and procedures  regular risk assessments  continuous monitoring  and proactive incident response planning step 1  strategic alignment and planningthe cornerstone of a successful cybersecurity program lies in its strategic alignment and planning  this critical first step involves setting clear cybersecurity goals that are closely aligned with the business objectives of the organization  integration of security controls into the organizational strategy is essential  ensuring every business aspect is underpinned by robust security measures  an effective strategy also includes the creation of a risk prioritization framework  which is instrumental in identifying and focusing on the most critical threats  furthermore  the development of a security architecture  tailored to the specific needs and risk profile of the organization  is crucial  this architecture needs to be dynamic  evolving in tandem with the changing landscape of cybersecurity threats and business requirements step 2  risk centric action and deploymentthe second phase of developing a cybersecurity program is centered around risk centric action and deployment  this involves establishing an efficient team structure  one that is dedicated to the meticulous implementation of the cybersecurity strategy  a key component of this phase is the deployment of the necessary tools and technologies that bring the strategic plan to life  translating high level strategies into actionable  practical steps is essential for effective execution  strategic allocation of resources  especially in areas with higher perceived risks  ensures that critical aspects of the network are prioritized and reinforced  moreover  the importance of continuous monitoring and management of security systems cannot be overstated  as they are vital for maintaining the efficacy of security measures and for addressing emergent threats swiftly step 3  continuous recalibration and optimizationin the final phase  the focus shifts to the continuous recalibration and optimization of the cybersecurity program  this phase demands maintaining accountability at all organizational levels and enhancing incident response capabilities to ensure swift and effective reactions to threats  cultivating a culture that is aware of cybersecurity  through the education of employees and stakeholders about security best practices and risks  forms the bedrock of this phase  regular evaluations and transparent communication of the program s effectiveness to key stakeholders are crucial for fostering an environment of continuous improvement  the cybersecurity strategies should be under constant review and refinement based on ongoing assessments  this adaptive approach ensures that cybersecurity measures remain both effective and relevant  aligning with the ever evolving business environment and the shifting landscape of cyber threats preparing for emerging trends and future threatsthe future of cybersecurity in the financial sector is likely to be shaped by emerging technologies and evolving threat landscapes ai and machine learning in cybersecuritythe integration of ai and machine learning in cybersecurity tools is set to revolutionize threat detection and response  these technologies can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns indicative of cyber threats  offering a level of speed and efficiency unattainable by human analysts alone the role of blockchain in enhancing securityblockchain technology has the potential to offer enhanced security features for financial transactions and data integrity  its decentralized and immutable nature makes it an attractive option for securing transaction records and preventing fraud cyber threats are constantly evolving  community banks must stay vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts  embracing comprehensive

227,february 14  2024fresh on the heels of the bank of america cyber compromise  another fortune 500 giant is notably in the data breach crosshairs  prudential financial said this week that hackers cracked  certain  of its systems earlier in the month the announcement also stands out for another reason  while corporations are now required to report cybersecurity incidents that have  material  impact to operations to the us securities   exchange commission  sec   prudential appears to have gotten out ahead of that new mandate with a voluntary incident disclosure  before any such impact has been determined  it s great to see that prudential financial quickly detected and responded to the data breach  and our hope is that the attackers were stopped before any sensitive data was stolen  and that the impact to the business is minimal   says joseph carson  chief security scientist and advisory ciso at delinea  for now though  those details are unclear cybercrime gang likely behind prudential s breachin a form 8 k notice to the sec  prudential said that it detected unauthorized access to its infrastructure on feb  5  it determined that the threat actor  which the financial and insurance behemoth believes was an organized cybercrime group  had gained access the day before to  administrative and user data from certain  it  systems  and a small percentage of company user accounts associated with employees and contractors  the company has kicked off its incident response  which is in the early stages  so far  it s unclear if the attackers accessed additional information or systems  heisted customer or client data  or if the incident will have a material impact on prudential operations with no evidence of any of those scenarios  prudential isn t yet under a mandate to report the breach  thus  researchers say the firm s sec filing is indicative of what could be a new trend  proactive filings we don t need to do this — but we willon dec  15  the sec incident disclosure rules changed to require a form 8 k to be filed within  four business days of determining  a cyber  incident was material  claude mandy  chief evangelist for data security at symmetry systems  notes that prudential s move to file before fully identifying the materiality of the breach could be an effort to defang any extortion attempts by the assailants the potential for weaponizing the new sec regulations is evident in the case of meridianlink  which opted to not negotiate with the ransomware group alphv  aka blackcat  after a cyberattack  the gang responded by filing a formal complaint with the sec  alleging that its recent victim failed to comply with new disclosure regulations  the proactive holding statement by prudential is indicative of the pressure being put on cybercrime victims by cybercriminals under this new incident reporting regime   mandy says   it is a sign of a well rehearsed incident response program  he adds   cybercriminals can and will be threatening public disclosure of the incident to extort money from the victims  an early disclosure like this relieves that pressure  but it requires modern data security tools to determine the likely materiality of the incident  meanwhile  darren guccione  ceo and co founder at keeper security  said in an emailed statement that such voluntary reporting of cyber incidents could simply be a spin doctoring effort  after seeing the fallout that uber and solarwinds execs suffered for not reporting incidents in a timely manner  prudential may be attempting to proactively mitigate reputational damage … this type of voluntary disclosure is likely motivated more by public relations than regulations   he noted the incident also points up a glaring omission in federal law  there are no blanket federal data privacy statutes that require businesses to inform customers directly of real or potential data breaches  and no corresponding fines or sanctions in place that act as punitive deterrents  the feds have effectively relegated data privacy and protection to the states and sector specific agency regulation  the california consumer privacy act  ccpa  is one of the strictest protections  though critics complain ccpa doesn t go far enough what sets the new sec rule apart from other regulations is its requirement that publicly traded companies report such breaches within four days of determining material impact  in contrast  hipaa gives healthcare entities 60 days for such notifications prudential did not immediately return a request for comment from dark reading  mandy notes that for now  prudential customers will just need to wait and see whether their information has been compromised in the breach  as we’ve seen with other breaches  there may be further aspects to the incident that are uncovered as the investigation and fallout continues   mandy says   the holding statement from prudential indicates that based on what they know right now  they do not believe it meets their threshold for materiality  this threshold is determined by prudential  based on whether the impact  in their view  would be material information to an investor or shareholder  he adds   we hope to see more detailed analysis from prudential as the investigation continues  about the author s you may also like,data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats

228,february 14  2024commentarycybersecurity has always been a cat and mouse game between the  good guys  and the  bad guys   with the growing prevalence of ai  including new forms like generative ai  this ongoing chess match has only grown more intense — and it s increasingly clear that ai will serve as the powerful  queen  that can tip the match in favor of whoever wields this piece most effectively cyberattacks are more sophisticated than everbad actors have wasted little time finding ways to incorporate generative ai into their activities  they ve been able to take their phishing efforts to a whole new level  messages now arrive as subtle  fluid prose  void of spelling errors or grammatical mistakes a clever scammer can even  prompt  generative ai models to assume a persona to make the phishing email more convincing  for example   make this email sound like it s coming from the accounting department of a fortune 500 company  or  imitate the writing style and mannerisms of executive x   with this type of highly targeted  ai honed phishing attack  bad actors increase their odds of stealing an employee s login credentials so they can access highly sensitive information  such as a company s financial details threat actors are also developing their own malevolent versions of mainstream gpt tools  darkgpt  for example  is able to tap into all corners of the dark web  making it very easy to gather information and resources that can be put to nefarious ends  there s also fraudgpt  which enables cybercriminals to create malicious codes and viruses with just a few strokes of their keyboard  the result  devastatingly efficient ransomware attacks that are easier than ever to launch  with a lowered barrier to entry unfortunately  as long as these illicit activities yield results  there will continue to be bad actors who seek creative ways to use new technologies like generative ai for sinister reasons  the good news is enterprises can leverage these very same capabilities to bolster their own security postures context is keyin the same way that darkgpt and fraudgpt can serve up harmful resources faster than ever before  a gpt tool deployed responsibly can serve up helpful resources — providing the context needed to help evade potential attacks and facilitate a more effective response to any threats for example  let s say a security professional sees some irregular activity or anomalous behavior happening in their environment  but they re not sure what the next steps are for appropriate investigation or remediation  generative ai can very quickly pull relevant information  best practices  and recommended actions from the collective intelligence of the security field  having this comprehensive context allows practitioners to quickly understand the nature of the attack  as well as what respective actions they should take this capability becomes particularly powerful when security teams can look at their environment holistically and analyze all of the data that s available seeing the full picturebefore  it was standard to observe a single system for normal behavior  or perhaps  more importantly  abnormal behavior  now  it s possible to look across multiple systems and configurations — including how they re interacting together — to deliver a much more detailed picture of what s happening across the environment  as a result  professionals can have a much deeper  contextual understanding of the unfolding situation and make better  more informed decisions additionally  generative ai doesn t just help security professionals make better decisions  it also helps them make faster decisions — with less manual effort today  there s a lot of grunt work involved in gaining visibility across the technology stack and digital footprint within the organization  pulling data together  and trying to figure out what s happening  given the scale and complexity of today s technology environments and the volumes of data involved  it s historically been impossible to provide a holistic security blanket or identify every single blind spot — and this is largely what bad actors are taking advantage of generative ai not only helps aggregate all of this data  it also democratizes it  this enables security professionals to perform analysis across massive amounts of information in near real time and can identify potential threats based on landscape changes they previously might have only stumbled on by accident  this alone can reduce the dwell time of any bad actors from days to just minutes — a significant advantage for the good guys there s cause for optimismas automobiles became more common in the early 1900s  it was customary to have someone carrying a red flag on the road ahead of the car to provide advance warning to other travelers that something new and unexpected was coming  and to be aware of their surroundings obviously  society has long since acclimatized to having vehicles on the road  they ve simply become part of the fabric of the world we live in  even as they ve become increasingly sophisticated and powerful when it comes to ai  we re at a red flag moment  we need to proceed mindfully and carefully  whether it s cars or ai  there is always some risk involved  but just as we ve added more enhanced security features to vehicles and increased regulations  we can do the same with ai ultimately  there s cause for optimism here  the cat and mouse game between hackers and defenders will continue  as it always has  but in using ai  and generative ai in particular  as a way to strengthen their overall security posture and fortify their defenses  the good guys will be able to take their game up a notch and improve their ability to keep the bad guys where they belong  in

231,feds dismantle russian gru botnet built on 1 000 plus home  small biz routersbeijing  now moscow … who else is hiding in broadband gateways the us government today said it disrupted a botnet that russia s gru military intelligence unit used for phishing expeditions  spying  credential harvesting  and data theft against american and foreign governments and other strategic targets this latest court authorized takedown happened in january  and involved neutralizing  well over a thousand  home and small business routers that had been infected with the moobot malware  which is a mirai variant  according to fbi director christopher wray  speaking at the munich cyber security conference on thursday  moobot can be used to remote control compromised devices and launch attacks against networks non gru cybercriminals installed moobot on ubiquiti edge os routers using publicly known default administrator passwords  we re told  then the gru spying team  tracked as apt 28  forest blizzard  and fancy bear among other names  used moobot to install their own bespoke scripts and files that repurposed the botnet  thus  turning it into a global cyber espionage platform   according to the feds russian intelligence services turned to criminal groups to help them target home and office routers russian intelligence services turned to criminal groups to help them target home and office routers  but the justice department disabled their scheme   opined attorney general merrick garland   we will continue to disrupt and dismantle the russian government’s malicious cyber tools that endanger the security of the united states and our allies  the botnet targeted organizations that are of interest to the russian government  including us and foreign governments and military  security  and corporate organizations  in december microsoft said the fancy bear crew had been exploiting two previously patched bugs for large scale phishing campaigns against high value targets such as government  defense  and aerospace agencies in the us and europe  though didn t say if a botnet was used in the attacks and earlier this week it emerged kremlin agents had been caught misusing openai s models to generate phishing emails and malicious software scripts takedownaccording to american prosecutors  the feds were able to instruct the moobot botnet to copy and delete malicious files – including the malware itself – and any stolen data on the compromised routers  likely similar to what the doj did with the recent volt typhoon kv botnet takedown the fbi said  pdf  the dismantling of the moobot network also involved modifying the routers  firewall rules to block remote management access to the devices  preventing them from being further hijacked  and  enabled temporary collection of non content routing information that would expose gru attempts to thwart  the operation that is to say  uncle sam was able to prevent russia s use of the botnet by firewalling off remote management access  scrubbed the malware from the routers  and also inspected the kremlin s handiwork on the infect equipment  all this was carried out with the consent of the owners of infected equipment  we re told plus  the feds said  users can rollback uncle sam s firewall rule changes via factory resets  or the routers  web based user interface  though bear in mind a reset potentially leaves devices open to hijacking again if one doesn t change the admin password from the default  a factory reset that is not also accompanied by a change of the default administrator password will return the router to its default administrator credentials  leaving the router open to reinfection or similar compromises   the justice department warned   fbi confirms it issued remote kill command to blow out volt typhoon s

their activity was very consistent with what we ve seen for years   kristen dennesen  threat intelligence analyst for google s threat analysis group  tag   said in a press conference this week   that activity continued on until just before october 7 — there wasn t any kind of shift or uptick prior to that point  and since that time  we haven t seen any significant activity from these actors  failing to ramp up cyberattacks prior to oct  7 might be construed as strategic  but regarding why hamas  irrespective of its supporters  has quit its cyber operations instead of using them to support its war effort  dennesen admitted   we don t offer any explanation as to why because we don t know  hamas pre oct  7   blackatom typical hamas nexus cyberattacks include  mass phishing campaigns to

of the three primary hamas linked threat actors  alongside blackstem  aka molerats  extreme jackal  and desertvarnish  aka unc718  renegade jackal  desert falcons  arid viper  in september  blackatom began a social engineering campaign aimed at software engineers in the israeli defense forces  idf   as well as israel s defense and aerospace industries the ruse involved posing as employees of companies on linkedin and messaging targets with fake freelance job opportunities  after initial contact  the false recruiters would send a lure document with instructions for participating in a coding assessment the fake coding assessment required recipients to download a visual studio project  masquerading as a human resources management app  from an attacker controlled github or google

executed a malicious zip file on the affected computer  inside the zip  the sysjoker multiplatform backdoor  nothing like russia it may seem counterintuitive that hamas  invasion wouldn t have been paired with a shift in its cyber activity akin to russia s model  this may be due to its prioritization of operational security — the secrecy that made its oct  7 terror attack so shockingly effective less explicable is why the most recent confirmed hamas related cyber activity  according to mandiant  occurred back on oct  4   gaza  meanwhile  has suffered from significant internet disruptions in recent months   i think the key thing to draw out is that these are very different conflicts  with very different entities involved   said shane huntley  senior director at google tag   hamas is nothing like russia  and therefore  it s not surprising that the use of cyber is very different  depending on  the nature of the conflict  between standing armies versus a sort of attack like we saw on october 7  but hamas likely has not fully retired its cyber operations   while the outlook for future cyber operations by hamas linked actors is uncertain in the near term  we do anticipate that hamas cyber activity will eventually resume  it should be focused on espionage for intelligence gathering on these intra palestinian affairs  israel  the united states  and other regional players in

234,cybersecurity in depth  feature articles on security strategy  latest trends  and people to know boards of directors don t care about a security program s minute technical details  they want to see how key performance indicators are tracked and used february 14  2024with the us securities and exchange commission requiring cisos and boards of directors to increase the level of transparency around their organizations  cybersecurity capabilities and to speed up breach disclosure to investors  cyber reporting and metrics have become an even bigger priority for companies this year boards are turning the screws to their security and risk executives to bring a lot more rigor to how they track key performance indicators  kpis  and key risk indicators  kris  — and how they use these metrics to advise and report to the board  fundamental to both kpis and kris are security operational metrics that track the scope of assets  cybersecurity activities around those assets  and measured security outcomes  security teams use operational metrics to track and report on cybersecurity activities and outcomes   explains the cyber savvy boardroom  a recent primer published by a pair of longtime cyber risk leaders to help directors and executive leaders wrap their arms around cyber issues   when shared with the board of directors’ risk or audit committees  these key performance indicators illuminate the organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and the efficiency of cyber controls while also helping the board of directors evaluate the adequacy of investments in technology and talent  co authored by homaira akbari  ceo of global advisory firm aknowledge partners  and shamla naidoo  head of cloud strategy for netskope  the book covers a lot of ground  but some of the most vital parts of the primer focus on metrics  dark reading summarizes and excerpts from the tome here to present the most common metrics that akbari and naidoo believe to be crucial for cisos to track and share with the board in order to report on risk levels and security performance the caveat  of course  is that security leaders need to be able to roll up these metrics into assessments and dashboards that are easy to digest  as explained in the primer  the metrics detailed in each category create a data backed model for determining the efficacy of an organization s program and identifying gaps in protection  the conclusions of these assessments should be summarized in several overall ratings and included in the company’s cybersecurity dashboard   akbari and naidoo explain datathese metrics should scope risk around data assets and track performance in key protection measures for data security  resilience  and continuity  some of the metrics akbari and naidoo advise cisos to track in this category include   data centralized  data encryptedbackup frequencyspeed of data recovery  employee customer user info on dark webdepth of data lake segmentationfinancial assetsfinancial asset risks and losses are included in this grouping of metrics  which should give a measured feel for financial consequences from recent breaches  some metrics the authors suggest tracking  based on past quarters or over the past year  include value of actual money crypto lost directlyvalue of money or productivity losses in form of ransomwarevolume of financial data leaked  accounts  credit cards  loyalty points  online banking credentials while not specifically listed  data on financial losses from business email compromise  bec  and indirect breach response costs would also be valuable to track peoplewhether it is falling prey to phishing or bec attacks — exposing data by not following policy or exposing systems in other ways — people are usually an enterprise s biggest vulnerability  while it may be hard to measure the efficacy of security awareness training  there are some good proxies to get a general sense of how well an organization s people are adhering to security best practices and policies  the authors suggest the following metrics in this category   phishing email click through  suspicious email reportedpasswords hackedprivileged accounts to total accounts  employees moving data files out of the enterpriseother metrics not directly mentioned but are still relevant include the results from phishing simulations  knowledge assessment scores  and behavioral or account data about high risk individuals supplierswith third party risk management and the digital supply chain security on the forefront of many executives  minds in the wake of events like solarwinds  boards will want to be informed of supplier related security operations risks and performance levels  akbari and naidoo believe cisos would do well to keep the business attuned to trending data and metrics around self certification of cybersecurity posture of third partiesexternal scoring against peers and industrycontinuous monitoring of posture of third and fourth partiesexternal audit compliancepenetration testing scores  from suppliers data about suppliers will likely have a lot of overlap with metrics about enterprise applications  see below   as application security teams start to look at software supply chain risk  including risky dependencies from third party code and components infrastructurewhether on premises or in the cloud  it infrastructure exposures and security capabilities in mitigating risks across the network and hardware assets should be appropriately monitored and measured  some operational data that the authors suggest in this category include metrics around number of servers hardware approaching end of lifesecure configurations of all assetsdepth of network  infrastructure segmentationlevel of automation of inventory and control of hardware assetsvulnerability scanningdepth of zero trust architecture deployment  identity  device  access  servicesuser controlled devicescisos should be able to give board members a feel for the level of control their organizations have over shadow it and other user controlled devices operating on the network  akbari and naidoo say the following common metrics should be on the radar number of unidentified devices on the networknumber of devices with unpatched softwarerate of false positivesnumber of threats detected and prevented by the endpoint solutionnew technologies  iotthe scope and scale of internet of things  iot  devices has opened up significant risk to enterprises over the course of the past decade  the authors suggest that cisos provide some risk metrics around these  including number of non upgradable or patchable iot devicesnumber of iot ports connecting to enterprise networksdepth of lot segmentation from enterprise resourceswhile the focus is currently on iot  the same approach could work for all emerging technology  ai  for example  could include metrics around ai use and — with some emerging ai security tooling — risk exposure levels from ai use in the organization enterprise applicationswhether it is from commercial software or applications developed in house  applications present some of the biggest attack surfaces in the enterprise today  akbari and naidoo offer a couple of common metrics boards should be apprised of known open software vulnerabilitiessoftware patches outstandingnumber of zero day software vulnerabilitiesthere is no shortage of additional application security data and metrics that can help track performance and risk levels across application portfolios  consider including data such as rate of automated versus manual code review  time to fix critical vulnerabilities  open rate of critical vulnerabilities  and metrics that add context about exploitability or business value of assets with known critical flaws testing security posturesecurity validation and testing is an important part of a security program  so cisos should be beholden to track not only the results from security tests  but also the rate at which they conduct testing  some metrics that fall into this category  according to akbari and naidoo  are penetration red  blue  testingindependent external security ratings versus peers and the industryinternal external auditor report on regulatory and cyber complianceapplication and other testing scores and discoveriesincident detection and responseboards of directors will be very interested in a security team s ability to detect and respond to incidents  akbari and naidoo recommend some of the following common ops metrics to track this • volumes and   of actual incidents versus intrusion attempts• mean time to detect• mean time to contain• mean time to remediate resolve• red team scores and discoveriesadditionally  cisos may benefit from offering metrics and results

236,cybercriminals are stealing ios users  face scans to break into mobile banking accountsdeepfake enabled attacks against android and iphone users are netting criminals serious cashcybercriminals are targeting ios users with malware that steals face scans from the users of apple devices to break into and pilfer money from bank accounts – thought to be a world first a chinese speaking cybercrime group  dubbed goldfactory by group ib s researchers  started distributing trojanized smartphone apps in june 2023  however  the latest goldpickaxe version has been around since october goldpickaxe and goldpickaxe ios target android and ios respectively  tricking users into performing biometric verification checks that are ultimately used to bypass the same checks employed by legitimate banking apps in vietnam and thailand – the geographic focus of these ongoing attacks the ios version is believed only to be targeting users in thailand  masquerading as the thai government s official digital pensions app  that said  some think it has also made its way to vietnam  this is because very similar attacks  which led to the theft of tens of thousands of dollars  were reported in the region earlier this month  it is of note that goldpickaxe ios is the first ios trojan observed by group ib that combines the following functionalities  collecting victims  biometric data  id documents  intercepting sms  and proxying traffic through the victims  devices   the researchers said  its android sibling has even more functionalities than its ios counterpart  due to more restrictions and the closed nature of ios  while android malware is more common  given the platform allows users to sideload apps  the ios discovery shocked researchers more given the tighter security controls on apple s platform the android infection was more straightforward than that of the ios version  with malicious apps simply being available to download sideload via a fake but seemingly legitimate google play store researchers also found the android version bore many more disguises than the ios version – taking the form of more than 20 different government  finance  and utility organizations in thailand  and allowing attackers to steal credentials for all of these services how d they get on apple phones in the case of ios  the attackers had to be cunning  their first method involved the abuse of apple s testflight platform  which allows apps to be distributed as betas before full release to the app store after this method was stymied  attackers switched to more sophisticated social engineering  this involved influencing users to enroll their devices in an mdm program  allowing the attackers to push bad apps to devices that way in all cases  the initial contact with victims was made by the attackers impersonating government authorities on the line messaging app  one of the region s most popular for example  in some cases back in november  criminals impersonated officials from the thai ministry of finance  and offered pension benefits to victims  elderly relatives from there  victims were socially engineered into downloading goldpickaxe through various means once the biometrics scans were captured  attackers then used these scans  along with deepfake software  to generate models of the victim s face attackers would download the target banking app onto their own devices and use the deepfake models  along with the stolen identity documents and intercepted sms messages  to remotely break into victims  banks the application of deepfake technology has largely been a hypothetical threat to infosec professionals for years  but goldpickaxe serves as another reminder that the technology is now mature enough for use in real world attacks and will probably be abused for years to come facial biometrics were only mandated in thailand last year  with plans first announced in march with an enforcement date set for july  vietnam is poised to mandate similar controls by april this year   miscreants turn to ad tech to measure malware metrics  european court of human rights declares backdoored encryption is illegal  north korea running malware laden gambling websites as a service  openai shuts down china  russia  iran  n korea accounts caught doing naughty thingsfrom july 2023  all thai banking apps had to comply with the new initiative and replace one time passcodes with facial biometrics to decrease the threat of financial fraud in the region  this applied specifically to transactions exceeding 50 000 bat  roughly  1 400  it means the goldfactory group was able to develop a bespoke bypass for this new security initiative within just a few months  underlining the attacker s capabilities and skill set  goldfactory is a resourceful team  having many tricks up their sleeve  impersonation  accessibility keylogging  fake banking websites  fake bank alerts  fake call screens  identity  and facial recognition data collection   said the researchers  equipped with diverse tools  they have the flexibility to select and execute the most suitable one that fits the scenario  they are a strategic and well orchestrated team  they are aware of their target landscape and are constantly improving their toolset to tailor it to their target environment  their developers demonstrate their relatively high proficiency in software development as well  the gold malware familygoldpickaxe is the latest iteration of the numerous trojans developed by the goldfactory crime group the first – golddigger – was spotted in june 2023 and acted mainly as a traditional android banking trojan granting control of a victim s device golddigger and goldpickaxe share code  but have different primary goals  the former focuses on gathering banking credentials while the latter pilfers personal information  including captures of victims  faces  identity documents  and so on golddiggerplus followed in september  adding additional  sophisticated functionality to the base golddigger trojan  including the goldkefu apk  which is used in conjunction with golddiggerplus  in contrast with golddigger which relies mainly on accessibility service  golddiggerplus and goldkefu use webfakes to collect credentials or perform targeted scam calls instead  we conclude that the main purpose of golddiggerplus is to authenticate itself to the c2 server  perform automated clicks when permissions are requested  record the screen  and stream the feed via real time messaging protocol  rtmp    the researchers said  it also makes an improvement from golddigger in the area of granting permissions  it now takes a more modular and controlled approach  that permission is requested and granted when the c2 issues the command  it does not grant all the permissions all at once like golddigger  goldkefu offers an interesting capability in that it integrates the agora sdk  enabling real time video and voice calls  attackers can then launch calls with victims while impersonating legitimate customer support reps from the brands they impersonate attackers can send fake alerts to app users warning them that 3 million bat has been transferred out of their account and to contact their bank if the transaction wasn t authorized other warnings include fake error messages popping up when the trojan prevents banking apps from opening  prompting users to contact their bank to  unfreeze their account  these alerts have a one touch  contact  button which  if initiated within the working hours set by the cybercriminals  will initiate a call with the criminals who essentially operate a scam bank call center to harvest further information the android version of the most recent goldpickaxe is thought to be an updated version of golddiggerplus  which also includes the goldkefu apk the ios version doesn t have these extensive capabilities due to the closed nature of apple s ios platform  the researchers said  the adaptability of these cyber adversaries is remarkable  as evidenced by the evolution of their fraud schemes   said group ib   in addition to refining the capabilities of the original golddigger malware  they have introduced a new category of malware families that specialize in harvesting facial recognition data  they have also developed a tool that facilitates direct communication between victims and cybercriminals posing as legitimate bank call centers  in conclusion  the relentless evolution of cybercriminal tactics  exemplified by the sophistication of the goldfactory malware  underscores the critical need for a proactive and multi faceted approach to cybersecurity  including user education and integrated modern security approaches to proactively detect the appearance of new trojans and notify end users   ®,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,"{'vulnerability reports': 0.152181938290596, 'security updates and patches':

learnings from an in depth analysis of more than 600 000 real world malware samples and identifies the most common techniques leveraged by attackers  this year  picus uncovered a surge of  hunter killer  malware from the research findings  demonstrating a drastic shift in adversaries  ability to identify and neutralize advanced enterprise defenses such as next gen firewalls  antivirus  and edr  according to the report  there was a 333  increase in malware that can actively target defensive systems in an attempt to disable them  we are witnessing a surge in ultra evasive  highly aggressive malware which shares the characteristics of hunter killer submarines   said dr  suleyman ozarslan  picus security co founder and vp of picus labs   just as these subs move silently through deep waters and launch devastating attacks to defeat their targets  defenses  new malware is designed to not only evade security tools but actively bring them down  we believe cybercriminals are changing tact in response to the security of average businesses being much improved  and widely used tools offering far more advanced capabilities to detect threats  a year ago  it was relatively rare for adversaries to disable security controls  now  this behavior is seen in a quarter of malware samples and is used by virtually every ransomware group and apt group  the red report helps security teams better understand and battle cyber attacks by identifying the top 10 most prevalent mitre att ck techniques exhibited by the latest malware  its insights help prioritize defensive actions against commonly used techniques  additional key findings include evolving tactics challenge detection and response  70  of malware analyzed now employ stealth oriented techniques by attackers  particularly those that facilitate evading security measures and maintaining persistence in networks invisibility at the forefront of evasion  there was a 150  increase in the use of t1027 obfuscated files or information  this highlights a trend toward hindering the effectiveness of security solutions and obfuscating malicious activities to complicate the detection of attacks  forensic analysis  and incident response efforts the ransomware saga continues  there was a 176  increase in the use of t1071 application layer protocol  which are being strategically deployed for data exfiltration as part of sophisticated double extortion schemes to combat hunter killer malware and stay ahead of 2024 malware trends  picus is urging organizations to embrace machine learning  protect user credentials  and consistently validate their defenses against the latest tactics and techniques used by cybercriminals  it can be incredibly difficult to detect if an attack has disabled or reconfigured security tools  because they may still appear to be working as expected   said huseyin can yuceel  security research lead at picus security   preventing attacks that would otherwise operate under the radar requires the use of multiple security controls with a defense in depth approach  security validation must be a starting point for organizations to better understand their readiness and identify gaps  unless an organization is proactively simulating attacks to assess the response of its edr  xdr  siem  and other defensive systems that may be weakened or eliminated by hunter killer malware  they will not know

saudi arabia based charity apts love reverse proxieszardoor s use of reverse proxy tools matches the tactics of several chinese advanced persistent threat  apt  groups  according to cisco talos  but the  choice of the compromised target does not align with the known objectives  of chinese espionage groups apt groups using reverse proxy tools is  relatively common   overall  says chris morgan  senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at reliaquest threat research russia s apt29  the chinese backed volt typhoon group  north korea s lazarus group  and various iranian state sponsored groups  including phosphorus  are among the roster of nation state groups that employ reverse proxy tools reverse proxies are normally used as load balancers in complex system and application architectures  however  malicious actors abuse the technology to set up communications with otherwise unreachable systems such as rdp servers  domain controllers  files  or database servers on compromised networks  reverse proxies function by allowing covert communications channels to be established between internal systems on a compromised network and external servers controlled by an adversarial group   says christoph cemper  founder and ceo of aiprm  at a technical level  this is accomplished by the adversary deploying both a reverse proxy client component within the target environment and a corresponding server interface that they control remotely   he adds   network traffic is then redirected through this multipart bidirectional tunnel in a manner that obscures the ultimate source and destination  cemper explains that adversaries frequently take steps to disguise these proxy facilitated connections as normal web or internet activity  such as routing communications over ports associated with common protocols like https and embedding the redirects within legitimate domain names or ip addresses  the incorporation of widely supported standards like tls encryption also shields the content and parameters of transmitted data from routine inspection or detection   he says thwarting the threataccording to cisco talos  technical blog post  the zardoor campaign began with an as yet unknown attack vector the attackers subsequently set up a command and control mechanism for the attack using open source reverse proxy tools such as fast reverse proxy  frp   a customized version of the socks linux server and venom  a penetration testing tool for running security audits once a foothold into the victim s network was established  the attackers used windows management instrumentation  wmi  for lateral movement and planting the zardoor malware zardoor establishes a persistent backdoor that communicates with the attackers  command and control  c2  setup  allowing them to issue commands  such as to deploy updated malware packages or exfiltrate data  the malware is programmed to grab encrypted data and upload it to the attackers  c2 infrastructure  zar32 dll  is a malicious library and one of the main components of zardoor  it is an http ssl remote access tool  rat  designed to piggyback on legitimate network applications  and operates through a socks or https proxy  the malware abuses ip addresses used by cloudflare dns services cisco has added detection for the zardoor malware to its enterprise security tools and published indications of compromise  moves that will likely spur the rest of the vendor community to add similar detection and response capabilities  even enterprises using security products other than cisco s have options to improve their resilience   says aiprm s cemper   specifically  security teams should follow standard protocols for addressing new malware threats identified in the wild  review the indicators of compromise published by threat researchers and check systems and network activity logs for any traces suggesting infection  in addition  he advises  ensure that anti malware and intrusion detection products are armed with updated signatures for the malware cisco talos recommends employing a defense in depth security posture to defend against similar threats   unfortunately  as we know it all too well  there is no 100  effective protection against persistent and advanced adversaries  and users need to be able to detect the attack if it successfully evades the protection layers   a cisco spokesperson said

africa  meta  region  in fact  more than three quarters of cisos in the region are planning to increase budgets by at least 10  this year  idc found this strong growth in part is driven by companies facing more cybercrime and regulatory enforcement  requiring them to increase spending on cybersecurity products and services  says yotasha thaver  a research analyst for it security data at idc south africa and meta  the increase in successful cybercrimes has driven demand for consulting services in non core countries where awareness is not as high compared to the core countries   she says   there is also a push coming from governments — particularly in the middle east — for improved cybersecurity  idc divides the region s countries into  core   which spend significantly on technology and

of saudi arabia  jordan  and united arab emirates — especially around data privacy and ai guidelines  are driving the increase  she says   and most importantly  geopolitical stress is leading to an increase in cyber budgets  especially in organizations with critical infrastructure  targeted attacks commonthe forecasted growth in the cybersecurity market comes as local cisos worry that their cloud security may be lacking  with around 70  of firms concerned over cloud security  targeted attacks by state actors are common in the middle east  with about 40  of cyber attacks carried out by apt groups  according to a report on the regional threats by cybersecurity firm positive technologies published last year  more than half of all threats targeted government agencies  industrial systems  or mass media  with remote access trojans  rats  and spyware the most common types of malware while ransomware is less common  the rise of wipers — resembling ransomware s destructive

250,february 15  2024commentarycybersecurity  once a fortress built on rigid protocols and reactive measures  is undergoing a transformative shift  as digital landscapes become more intricate and data driven  the need for a nuanced approach to safeguarding digital assets is more pronounced than ever  this evolution marks a departure from conventional threat detection  steering toward a strategy that emphasizes context and preempts user behavior to detect anomalous patterns this isn t just about erecting barriers against known threats  it s about delving deeper into the subtleties of how data is accessed  shared  and utilized  it s a proactive stance  focusing on the early detection of potential risks through the lens of user interactions and data movements  instead of simply  guarding the fort   for many analysts  this heralds a significant change in how organizations perceive and tackle cybersecurity  shifting the focus from basic threat hunting and detection to a more holistic understanding of the digital ecosystem threat hunting alone is no longer enoughthe conventional model of cybersecurity has long been centered on reactive threat detection  this approach  grounded in the detection of known threats  remains important and was incredibly effective in a digital landscape where threats were more predictable and less complex  it relied on established security protocols and predefined threat databases  focusing on identifying and mitigating threats after they had breached the system  this method served as the foundation of many cybersecurity frameworks  operating under the assumption that known threats could be managed effectively with existing tools and knowledge however  the digital world s rapid expansion into the cloud  combined with a rush of new ai based capabilities  has brought about a new era of cyber threats  characterized by their complexity and subtlety  the limitations of the traditional model have become increasingly apparent  as cyberattackers continuously develop novel methods to circumvent standard security measures  these emerging threats often exploit vulnerabilities in unexpected ways  making the reactive nature of threat detection on its own obsolete  this realization has sparked a crucial shift in cybersecurity  giving rise to strategies that are not just reactive but also proactive  leveraging user behavior and data flow to assess risk and preempt potential threats the rise of user and entity behavior analytics  ueba user and entity behavior analytics  ueba  isn t exactly new  but it s now becoming standard  ueba is unique in that it shifts the focus from simply responding to known threats to analyzing patterns of user and entity behavior to identify anomalies that could indicate potential security risks  this method leverages advanced analytics  machine learning  and  big data  to build a comprehensive baseline of normal user behavior  making it easier to spot deviations that could signal a breach or malicious activity  by focusing on behavior patterns  ueba provides an adaptive  context sensitive approach to security  capable of identifying threats that traditional tools might miss this approach is particularly effective in detecting insider threats  compromised accounts  and even subtle forms of data exfiltration  for instance  ueba can flag activities like unusual login times  repeated failed access attempts  or unexpected spikes in data downloads  these activities  while not inherently malicious  can serve as early warning signs of potential security issues  it s not about spotting  bad behavior  per se  but about identifying  not good  behavior and flagging it as a potential concern  by integrating ueba into their cybersecurity strategies  organizations can gain a more nuanced and proactive stance in their defense mechanisms  enabling them to respond to threats before they escalate into serious breaches the growing importance of data flowdata flow involves deep diving into the intricacies of how data is handled  accessed  and transferred within an organization  this concept extends beyond the traditional perimeter defense  delving into the granular aspects of data movement and access patterns  by understanding the mechanics of data — how it flows  who accesses it  and when — cybersecurity strategies can be fine tuned to detect subtle irregularities that might indicate a security risk  it s like understanding the inner workings of a complex machine  by learning each part s role and normal operation  it becomes easier to identify when something doesn t work as intended  this level of insight is crucial in a landscape where threats are not always overt or immediately recognizable  by incorporating data flow into their cybersecurity framework  including good api security practices  organizations can adopt a more proactive stance  identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited in tandem with the shift toward more nuanced cybersecurity strategies  there s also a growing emphasis on data privacy and the adoption of sovereign clouds and data localization  this trend reflects an increasing awareness of the need for stringent data protection  especially in a global context  where data regulations vary significantly across regions  sovereign clouds offer a solution by aligning data storage and processing with local regulations  ensuring compliance and enhancing data sovereignty  this proactive approach to privacy is not just about adhering to laws like the gdpr  it s about recognizing the importance of regional nuances in data regulation and providing a tailored response  by integrating these considerations into their cybersecurity framework  organizations ensure that their data management practices are not only secure but also compliant with the diverse legal requirements they face  fortifying their stance on both cybersecurity and data privacy integrating ueba into modern cybersecurity strategiesmodern cybersecurity solutions that support ueba often include features that facilitate secure remote access to data  controlled sharing  and collaboration  all while maintaining a vigilant watch over data security  these features ensure that while employees and partners can access and work with data seamlessly  any unusual activity is promptly identified and addressed  this balance of security and usability is crucial in today s fast paced  data driven business environments  where the agility of operations must be matched with uncompromising security measures  by weaving ueba and data flow into their security initiatives  organizations can achieve this balance  creating a robust security framework that supports  rather than hinders  their

252,february 15  2024microsoft has identified one of the critical vulnerabilities in exchange server that the company disclosed in february s patch tuesday update as actually being a zero day threat that attackers are already actively exploiting cve 2024 21410 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability that gives a remote  unauthenticated attacker a way to disclose and then relay windows nt lan manager  ntlm  hashes to impersonate legitimate users on exchange server bug enabled pass the hash attacksmicrosoft had assessed the bug as being of critical severity  9 1 on the 10 point cvss scale  but initially did not flag it as a zero day when releasing a fix for it tuesday  the company revised its advisory for the flaw on wednesday with a note about observing exploit activity in the wild but providing no other details the company s revision makes cve 2024 2140 one of three zero day bugs that microsoft disclosed this month  the other two are cve 2024 21412  a security feature bypass flaw that a threat actor called water hydra  aka dark casino  is using in attacks against financial traders  and cve 2024 21351  a smartscreen bypass vulnerability according to microsoft  cve 2024 21410 allows an attacker to target an ntlm client such as outlook in an ntlm credential leaking attack   the leaked credentials can then be relayed against the exchange server to gain privileges as the victim client and to perform operations on the exchange server on the victim s behalf   microsoft said the problem in the case of cve 2024 21410 has to do with versions of exchange server 2019 prior to the feb  13 update not enabling ntlm relay protections — or extended protection for authentication  epa  — by default  without that protection  an attacker can relay leaked ntlm credentials from targets such as outlook to exchange server  microsoft said cumulative updatethe feb  13 update — 2024 h1 cumulative update  cu  for exchange server 2019  or cu14  — enables that protection by default  meaning users who implement it are protected against the threat from cve 2024 21410  microsoft has published an exchange blog post for more information on the update and its protections against various threats mayuresh dani  manager of security research at qualys threat research labs  says attackers are likely to have little trouble finding vulnerable exchange servers to target   by my last count  there were more than 200 000 microsoft exchange devices currently exposed to the public   dani says   sifting through these using automation would take a few hours to come up with a list of affected systems  mike walters  president and ceo of action1  says organizations using versions of exchange server 2019 prior to cu14 will need to ensure they have activated epa alongside installing the latest cumulative update  he says   administrators can also use the exchangeextendedprotectionmanagement powershell script to enable ep in earlier versions of exchange server  such as server 2016  which will also protect systems from attacks that target devices that are missing the cve 2024 21410 patches  pay attention to the detailsbefore enabling ep on exchange servers  however  administrators should assess their environment and review the issues that microsoft has identified in its ep documentation to avoid disrupting existing functionality  walters advises  administrators should be aware that ep only uses ntlmv2 and tls 1 2 and later   he says  another consideration is the fact that extended protection isn t supported in environments that use ssl offloading  similarly  under certain circumstances organizations cannot enable extended protection on exchange server 2013 servers  exchange server 2016 cu22  exchange server 2019 cu11 or older  and on exchange servers that are published with the hybrid agent  additional issues are described on the microsoft support website and you must be prepared for them   walters says   this update needs to be fully tested before implementation   organizations shouldn t even try to apply the update without proper testing  he adds attackers often use a so called pass the hash method for lateral movement purposes  the tactic involves stealing a user s ntlm hash from one computer and using it to access another computer  in this case an exchange server  one of its main appeals is that the tactic allows users to authenticate as a legitimate user on a target system without knowing the user s password in 2023  russia s fancy bear advanced persistent threat group  aka forest blizzard and apt28  took advantage of a similar

satellites for the missile defense agency s  mda  hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor  hbtss   and the final four tranche 0 satellites for the space development agency s  sda  proliferated warfighter space architecture  pwsa  communications constellation american defense contractor l3harris  which designed five of the six satellites  said the launch  using a spacex falcon 9 rocket  was a success  the other satellite  a second hbtss unit  was built by northrop grumman  this launch represents a pivotal time for mda as we enter a new phase of missile warning  tracking and defense   said mda director lieutenant general heath collins   these hbtss satellites are an essential step forward in our efforts to stay ahead of our adversaries  the spacex falcon 9 rocket that took six pentagon missile tracking satellites to orbit yesterday     source  spacex us dodan mda spokesperson told the register the two hbtss satellites launched yesterday are the only two planned for the program yesterday s launch brings the total number of pwsa satellites to 27  all of which form of the first layer of the military s missile tracking and data transport kit  a k a  tranche 0  launch of those satellites began in april of last year after a number of delays in the program tests of the pwsa tranche 0 satellites  which was supposed to take place over the summer last year  only happened in late november due to concerns from the us federal aviation administration that downlinks from the constellation to earth could cause dangerous interference for aircraft and ground based receivers the national telecommunications and information agency issued a waiver for the tests  but only over international waters and on the ground in an unnamed five eyes country the pwsa constellation will eventually feature as many as four tranches and hundreds of satellites  which will add progressively more capabilities to build a space based communications network for us military  along with missile tracking  pwsa satellites will provide targeting of objects beyond line of site  low latency data links  improved positioning and navigation services  and encrypted communications satellites for tranche 1 of the pwsa are being constructed now  we re told  and are scheduled for launch later this year the pair of hbtss satellites  on the other hand  are a  space sensor prototype demonstration providing fire control quality data required to defeat advanced missile threats   the pentagon said yesterday  the missile sensors in hbtss satellites are also different from those onboard pwsa sats  which sda director derek tournear said will give the defense department improved threat visibility  in tranche 1  of pwsa   sda will fly both sensor types as an operational system – medium field of view demonstrating fire control  based on hbtss design  and wide field of view doing warning and tracking  based on t0 tracking design   tournear said  following the successful demonstration of hbtss capabilities  the responsibility for hbtss operational fielding will be transferred to  the us space force  and mda will continue the development of the next generation of space based fire control sensors for missile defense   an mda spokesperson told us but can they stop space nukes us house intelligence committee chairman mike turner  r oh  made a cryptic statement yesterday alluding to a  serious national security threat   reports have claimed turner was referring to russian plans to develop and deploy some kind of space based nuclear weapon  though it s not entirely clear that s actually the case reports have indicated the russian weapon would be designed to take out other satellites  and while turner has urged president biden to declassify all information regarding the threat to enable open discussion of a solution  other parties are urging calm and saying the potential weapon isn t necessarily a threat   report reveals us space force unprepared to counter orbital threats  us amends hypersonic weapons strategy  if you can t zoom with  em  boom  em  russia says starlink satellites could become military targets  us space force finally creates targeting unit –

257,news  news analysis  and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology cisa s recently introduced framework for hardware bill of materials is an important step in addressing semiconductor risks  but further tracking beyond manufacturing is critical to its usefulness february 15  2024the recently published hardware bill of materials  hbom  framework from the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency  cisa  is a much needed step toward ensuring semiconductor chip security — but it doesn t go far enough the framework offers a consistent and repeatable way for vendors and purchasers to communicate about hardware components  which is critical for supply chain management and risk assessment  however  an hbom must go beyond the manufacturing of semiconductor devices  it must track chips once they leave the factory  throughout their entire life cycle in the end products  in order to provide the robust security we need against emerging cyber threats we were reminded why this level of vigilance is important in august  when google researcher daniel moghimi uncovered the downfall vulnerability  downfall  which affects a broad family of advanced microprocessors  can be exploited to allow attackers access to private data  but the initial chips impacted by the vulnerability were manufactured in 2015  it has been eight years since the first devices to include those semiconductors entered the market even if cisa s hbom framework had been in place back then  it would still be ineffective against downfall because it doesn t track where and how those semiconductors are in use  that s why we need a more thorough hbom framework  one with additional life cycle traceability  to shore up a chip s security posture once a new vulnerability is uncovered existing framework a good startdespite its early shortcomings  cisa must be commended for introducing an hbom framework  even if it calls it  voluntary and flexible   it s a meaningful action by the government to address security risks within the semiconductor supply chain the framework encourages businesses to detail their upstream sourcing  including a list of all suppliers and components  it also calls for traceability throughout the manufacturing process  and it outlines a consistent way to name all component attributes these are all worthwhile conditions because while a company may know what a chip is supposed to do  it often doesn t know how it has been designed  by spelling it out  cisa acknowledges the pivotal role that safeguarding the supply chain plays in ensuring chip security  this increased visibility is intended to marginalize high risk vendors and minimize counterfeit or malicious parts from being introduced during production this framework follows another recent government effort to increase supply chain transparency — us president joe biden s may 2021 executive order that mandates software bills of materials  sboms  for federal vendors  an sbom inventories all software components  versions  and vulnerabilities so organizations can quickly respond to security concerns as they arise  pairing one with an hbom would provide comprehensive  integrated  and complementary security tracking of the entire life cycle of electronic products from development to disposal but unlike the sbom directive  the scope of cisa s hbom framework conclusively ends when manufacturing is complete  there must be a record of where that chip ends up  by forgoing that same level of visibility after chips leave the factory  multiple security risks persist  we need an hbom with an end to end view to help us act once we identify the downfalls of the future chips remain vulnerable for yearsas downfall demonstrated  vulnerabilities may not surface until years after devices have gone to market because hardware components can have prolonged life spans and lack modern security protections  whereas software can be patched  hardware vulnerabilities — unless they can be remediated by a firmware update — must be addressed through physical manipulation or other fixes that may reduce a device s performance or disable functionality altogether this is what makes a more comprehensive hbom important  organizations must be able to grasp which threats they face due to chip vulnerabilities  with complete visibility into the manufacturing and entire life cycle of the chip  only the utmost transparency can provide the necessary intelligence for proactive monitoring and rapid response once flaws inevitably surface  anything

258,february 15  2024showcasing a previously unseen cyberattack technique  threat actors are using amazon web services simple notification service  aws sns  and a custom bulk messaging spam script called sns sender to fuel an ongoing  smishing  campaign that impersonates the us postal service while the abuse of aws sns  a cloud based messaging platform  is novel  the campaign is an example of what is becoming an increasingly common theme  businesses and threat actors are both moving their respective workloads to the cloud rather than handling it through traditional web servers  according to a report today from sentinelone  and that presents serious business risk to those entities whose legitimate cloud instances have been compromised by attackers looking to piggyback on their aws capabilities smishing infection routinethe sns sender script author or authors  who went by the alias  arduino das  from 2020 to 2023  were known to be prolific in the phishing kit scene  though this handle appears to have been abandoned after the operators were accused of scamming phishing kit buyers on the dark web  according to sentinelone  the former alias  however  is still found in all of the threat actors  tools  which are still being used and actively circulated  including the latest campaign from last month according to alex delamotte  senior threat researcher at senitelone and author of the report  the sns sender attack uses a version of the well worn  missed package  notification lure  claiming to be from the usps  i ve gotten a lot of these  and i know that a lot of other people have  they say that you ve missed a package  and you need to pick it up at the post office   delamotte says  adding that while the campaign casts a wide  non specific net  senior citizens are most likely to fall prey to it   it tells you to sign in and it looks a lot like the real usps page  but it s collecting the person s name  address  and credit card number  the text messages contain urls that lead to phishing pages  which ask individuals to enter their personally identifiable information  pii  and payment card details  these are then sent to the attacker s server  as well as a telegram channel   it s kind of like a centralized place to see logs that are collected from these phishing kits   delamotte says   we ve actually seen logs of it  it also logs which phishing kits are used  business risk  the trouble with cloud phishingthe campaign s standout aspect is the use of aws sns  according to sentinelone  there s a lot of red tape to be able to send sms messages in the cloud  there are federal regulations and an sms registration framework known as a2p 10dlc  this framework implements federal guidelines for cloud or software as a service  saas  providers to effectively know their customer   delamotte emphasizes that means that the attackers need to have legitimate  trusted credentials to be able to maintain the campaign  what essentially happens is threat actors will steal an existing businesses cloud credentials  likely because they cannot pass the vetting process to sign up for them on their own  the threat actor will then use those credentials to send the phishing text messages to various users  using the legitimate business  domain however  there are further hurdles  compromising any old aws instance isn t enough — the attackers also need to verify a targeted environment s sns capabilities  sns sender represents a more narrow approach that relies on the actor having access to a properly configured aws sns tenant   according to sentinelone s report   using aws presents a challenge for this actor  aws does not allow sms notifications via sns by default  for this feature to work  the tenant needs to be removed from the sns sandbox environment  all of this carries significant risk for businesses  first of all  the domain hijacking creates a bad image for the business  because they are the face of the scam to the user  in addition  being hijacked could compromise the sms capabilities a business has to communicate with its customers  according to delamotte  an affected organization will likely have to fight to keep its sms capabilities active that s especially bad news for organizations that maintain high volume sms communications with consumers  such as e commerce providers or those running loyalty programs for businesses  avoiding being caught up in sns sender comes down to what delamotte considers to be basic security hygiene  organizations need to make sure that they re not exposing their own

microsoft office  windows  microsoft exchange server  the company s chromium based edge browser  azure active directory  microsoft defender for endpoint  and skype for business  tenable identified 30 of the 73 cves as remote code execution  rce  vulnerabilities  16 as enabling privilege escalation  10 as tied to spoofing errors  nine as enabling distributed denial of service attacks  five as information disclosure flaws  and three as security bypass issues water hydra exploits zero days targeting financial tradersa threat actor dubbed as water hydra  aka dark casino  is currently leveraging one of the zero day vulnerabilities — an internet shortcut files security feature bypass vulnerability tracked as cve 2024 21412  cvss 8 1  — in a malicious campaign targeting organizations in the financial sector researchers at trend micro — among several who discovered and reported the flaw to microsoft — described it as tied to a bypass of a previously patched smartscreen vulnerability  cve 2023 36025  cvss 8 8  and affecting all supported windows versions  water hydra actors are using cve 2024 21412 to gain initial access to systems belonging to financial traders and drop the darkme remote access trojan on them to exploit the vulnerability  an attacker would first need to deliver a malicious file to a targeted user and get them to open it  said saeed abbasi  manager of vulnerability researcher at qualys  in emailed commentary   the impact of this vulnerability is profound  compromising security and undermining trust in protective mechanisms like smartscreen   abbasi said smartscreen bypass zero daythe other zero day that microsoft disclosed in this month s security update affects defender smartscreen  according to microsoft  cve 2024 21351 is a medium severity bug that allows an attacker to bypass smartscreen protections and inject code into it to potentially gain remote code execution capabilities  a successful exploit could lead to limited data exposure  systems availability issues  or both  microsoft said  no details are available on who exactly might be exploiting the bug and for what purpose in prepared comments for dark reading  mike walters  president and co founder of action1  said the vulnerability is tied to the manner in which microsoft s mark of the web  a feature for identifying untrusted content from the internet  interacts with the smartscreen feature   for this vulnerability  an attacker must distribute a malicious file to a user and persuade them to open it  allowing them to circumvent the smartscreen checks and potentially compromise the system s security   walters said high priority bugsamong the five critical vulnerabilities in the february update  the one that requires priority attention is cve 2024 21410  a privilege escalation vulnerability in exchange server  a favorite target for attackers  an attacker could use the bug to disclose a targeted user s net new technology lan manager  ntlm  version 2 hash and then relay that credential against an affected exchange server and authenticate to it as the user flaws like this that disclose sensitive information like ntlm hashes can be very valuable to attackers  said satnam narang  senior staff research engineer at tenable in a statement   a russian based threat actor leveraged a similar vulnerability to carry out attacks — cve 2023 23397 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in microsoft outlook patched in march 2023   he said to patch the flaw  exchange admins will need to ensure they have installed exchange server 2019 cumulative update 14  cu14  update and ensure the extended protection for authentication  epa  feature is enabled  trend micro said  the security vendor pointed to an article that microsoft has published that provides additional information on how to patch the vulnerability microsoft has assigned cve 2024 21410 a maximum severity rating of 9 1 out of 10  which makes it a critical vulnerability  but typically privilege escalation vulnerabilities tend to score relatively low on the cvss vulnerability rating scale which belies the true nature of the threat they present  said kev breen  senior director of threat research at immersive labs   despite their low score   privilege escalation  vulnerabilities are highly sought after by threat actors and used in almost every cyber incident   breen said in a statement   once an attacker has access to a user account through social engineering or some other attack  they will next seek to escalate their permissions either to local admin or domain admin  walters from action1 highlighted cve 2024 21413  an rce flaw in microsoft outlook as a vulnerability that administrators might want to prioritize from february s batch  the critical severity flaw with a near maximum severity score of 9 8 involves low attack complexity  no user interaction  and no special privileges required for an attacker to exploit it   an attacker can exploit this vulnerability via the preview pane in outlook  allowing them to circumvent office protected view and force files to open in edit mode  rather than in the safer protected mode   walters said microsoft itself identified the vulnerability as something that attackers are less likely to attack  nevertheless  walters said the vulnerability poses a substantial threat for organizations and requires prompt attention about the author s you may also like,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,"{'vulnerability reports':

263,with many of the highly publicized 2023 cyber attacks revolving around one or more saas applications  saas has become a cause for genuine concern in many boardroom discussions  more so than ever  considering that genai applications are  in fact  saas applications wing security  wing   a saas security company  conducted an analysis of 493 saas using companies in q4 of 2023  their study reveals how companies use saas today  and the wide variety of threats that result from that usage  this unique analysis provides rare and important insights into the breadth and depth of saas related risks  but also provides practical tips to mitigate them and ensure saas can be widely used without compromising security posture the tl dr version of saas security2023 brought some now infamous examples of malicious players leveraging or directly targeting saas  including the north korean group unc4899  0ktapus ransomware group  and russian midnight blizzard apt  which targeted well known organizations such as jumpcloud  mgm resorts  and microsoft  respectively   and probably many others that often go unannounced the first insight from this research cements the concept that saas is the new supply chain  providing an almost intuitive framework to the importance of securing saas usage  these applications are clearly an integral part of the modern organization s set of tools and vendors  that said  long gone are the days when every 3rd party with access to company data had to go through security or it approval  even in the most rigorous companies  when a diligent employee needs a quick and efficient solution  they ll look it up and use it to get their jobs  done faster and better  again  think of the widespread use of genai  and the picture is clear as such  any organization concerned about the security of its supply chain must adopt saas security measures  according to the mitre att ck technique  trusted relationships   t1199   a supply chain attack occurs when an attacker targets a vendor to exploit it as a means to infiltrate a broader network of companies  by entrusting sensitive data to external saas vendors  organizations subject themselves to supply chain risks that reach beyond immediate security concerns four common saas risksthere are various reasons and ways in which saas is being targeted  the good news is that most of the risks can be significantly mitigated when monitored and controlled  basic saas security capabilities are even free  suited for organizations that are just beginning to develop their saas security posture or need to compare it to their current solution 1  shadow saasthe first problem with saas usage is the fact that it often goes completely unnoticed  the number of applications used by organizations is typically 250  larger than what a basic and often used query of the workspace reveals amongst the companies analyzed   41  of applications were used by only one individual  resulting in a very long tail of unsanctioned applications   1 out of 5 users were utilizing applications not used by anyone else within their organization  creating security and resource strains   63  of single user applications were not even accessed within a 3 month period  begging the question   why keep them connected to company data   96 7  of organizations used at least one application that had a security incident in the previous year  solidifying the continuous risk and need for proper mitigation 2  mfa bypassingwing s research indicates a trend where users opt to use a username password to access the services they need  bypassing the security measures in place  see image 1   image 1  from wing security s research  bypassing mfa 3  forgotten tokensusers grant the applications they need tokens  this is necessary for the saas applications to serve their purpose  the problem is that these tokens are often forgotten about after a few or just one use  wing s research revealed a large presence of unused tokens over a period of 3 months  creating an unnecessarily large attack surface for many customers  image 2  4  the new risk of shadow aiin the beginning of 2023  security teams primarily concentrated on a select few renowned services offering access to ai based models  however  as the year progressed  thousands of conventional saas applications adopted ai models  the research shows that 99 7  of companies were using applications with integrated ai capabilities organizations were required to agree to updated terms and conditions permitting these applications to utilize and refine their models using the organizations  most confidential data  often  these revised terms and conditions slipped under the radar  along with the usage of ai itself there are different ways in which ai applications may use your data for their training models  this can come in the form of learning your data  storing your data and even having a human manually go over your data to improve the ai model  according to wing  this capability is often configurable and totally avoidable  provided it is not overlooked solving saas security challenges in 2024the report ends on a positive note  listing 8 ways in which companies can mitigate the growing threat of the saas supply chain  including   ongoing shadow it discovery and management   prioritize the remediation of saas misconfigurations  optimize anomaly detection with

264,february 15  2024the portion of china s volt typhoon advanced persistent threat  apt  that focuses on infiltrating operational technology  ot  networks in critical infrastructure has already performed reconnaissance and enumeration of multiple us based electric companies  while also targeting electric transmission and distribution organizations in african nations that s according to ot security specialist dragos  which found that the ot threat  which it has dubbed  voltzite   has been  knocking on the door  of compromising physical industrial control systems  icses  at electric sector targets  though so far their incursions have been limited to the it networks that connect to the ot footprint the findings corroborate recent declarations by the us government that the state sponsored threat is pre positioning itself to be able to sow chaos and disrupt the power grid domestically in the case of military conflict  when we look at volt typhoon  that is an a player team  a strategic adversary  well resourced and very sophisticated   said robert m  lee  founder and ceo at dragos  during a media roundtable this week   and when we look at what we track  which is voltzite  that s the ot portion and the ot focus  of that group   we can validate us government s focus on volt typhoon  and we can validate their targeting of strategic electric sites  case study  volt typhoon lurks inside midsize power companyin one case that dragos investigated  voltzite compromised a midsize electric utility in the us and managed to stay hidden  for well over 300 days   according to lee  it was very clear that the adversary  though contained to the enterprise it network  was explicitly trying to get into the ot network there   he explained   they were knocking on the door  they were doing everything that you d expect to explicitly get into the power operations networks  further analysis showed that the apt was hunting for data that could aid its efforts to cross over into physical control systems  i can confirm that they were stealing a lot of ot specific data and insights  and scada related information and gis related information  and things that would be useful in future disruptive attacks   lee explained   it was clear that voltzite was specifically thinking about key targets and how to take down power in the future  based on what they were stealing  to help keep the threat contained  lee said the firm packaged up its threat intelligence findings from the incident response  sharing them with other potential voltzite targets as well as the federal government volt typhoon expands activitysince being publicly outed in may 2023  volt typhoon  aka bronze silhouette  vanguard panda  and unc3236  is known to have compromised the us territory of guam  telecom providers  military bases  and the united states emergency management organization  among others dragos  own investigation uncovered evidence of volt typhoon expansion  and that voltzite specifically had not only cast a wide net across us power companies and some targets in africa  but that it overlaps with uta0178  a threat activity cluster tracked by volexity that was exploiting ivanti vpn zero day vulnerabilities at ics targets back in december further  last month dragos discovered it conducting extensive reconnaissance of a us telecommunications provider s external network gateways and found evidence that voltzite compromised a large us city s emergency services geospatial information systems  gis  network  what is concerning to us is not just that they ve deployed very specific capabilities to do disruption   lee said   the concern is the targets they have picked  across satellite  telecommunications  and electric power generation  transmission  and distribution   which he stressed are cherry picked for their ability to cause the most disruption to american lives should they be taken offline voltzite s stealthy cyber intrusion tacticsthe dragos investigation showed that voltzite uses various techniques for credential access and lateral movement once inside a network  its hallmark  like that of the broader volt typhoon threat  is using legitimate tools and living off the land  lotl  to avoid signature detection one tactic includes the use of csvde exe  a native windows binary used for importing and exporting data from active directory domain services using the csv file format  in other cases  it uses volume shadow copies  i e   cloned images of the windows operating system that can be used as backups   and the extraction of the ntds dit active directory database from a domain controller  which enumerates user accounts  groups  and computers  and most importantly  contains the hashes of user passwords source  dragos under normal circumstances  the ntds dit file cannot be opened or copied as it is in use by active directory on the machine   according to dragos  annual ot threat report  which is due to be released next week   to circumvent this protection  adversaries commonly use the volume shadow copy service to create a cloned image of the operating system and save it to a disk  then the adversary can exfiltrate the copy of ntds dit residing in the shadow copy with no issues  as that file version is not in use by any processes  after that  voltzite can perform hash cracking or use  pass the hash  techniques to authenticate as a user while voltzite is known for using minimal tooling  it has used the frp reverse proxy tool and multiple web shells to channel data to a command and control  c2  server  according to the dragos report  which contains a list of the lotl binaries that voltzite is using utilities should act now on cyber defensewhile its disruptive intentions are clear  so far dragos has not seen voltzite successfully display actions or capabilities that could disrupt  degrade  or destroy ics ot assets or operations  that doesn t mean things won t change  however aura sabadus  an energy markets specialist at independent commodity intelligence services  icis   notes that attacks against energy utilities more than doubled between 2020 and 2022  with hackers disabling transmission systems or power plants  with new entrants like volt typhoon representing an existential threat to critical gas  electricity and water infrastructure  more investment will be necessary to ward off the worst case scenario  although many utilities across the globe dedicate significant budgets to fight cyberattacks  many companies remain in reactive mode and do not seem to have a long term strategy   she says   large investments are needed to respond to the growing risks  but at the same time they may also be eating into the budgets that are required to scale up renewable forms of generation  to bolster protection  dragos recommends that organizations implement the sans institute s 5 critical controls for world class ot cybersecurity craft an operations informed incident response  ir  plan

266,february 15  2024press releaseboulder  colo   feb 15  2024   strata identity  the identity orchestration company  today announced global access orchestration recipes that manage the complex identity relationships and processes associated with meeting data sovereignty and privacy compliance requirements for organizations with global operations  together with strata’s maverics identity orchestration platform  these identity orchestration recipes ensure that data accessed across multiple identity providers  idps  and cloud platforms remains sovereign  resident  and local to comply with regional regulations these new orchestration recipes and additional resources on solving global access and identity management challenges are available on the strata global access cookbook page multinational organizations face three distinct global access and compliance challenges  firstly  they must simultaneously satisfy an intricate web of data privacy and protection regulations in each jurisdiction where they operate  which includes managing identities and access policies across regional idps  meanwhile  companies with international customers must ensure compliance with foreign data privacy laws  such as the european gdpr  regardless of where their headquarters are located  finally  they must proactively enforce data storage policies to avoid countries where governments can lawfully  or otherwise  seize data “every employee  no matter where they are in the world  needs shared access to a common set of applications  meanwhile data residency regulations — and the need to support multiple regional idps and identity policies — make access hard to secure and control  but it doesn’t have to be ” said eric olden  ceo of strata identity  “strata’s maverics was purpose built for the needs of multinational enterprises because it is optimized for multiple clouds and idps   across the globe  our orchestration recipes enable customers to enforce granular policies for identity sovereignty to comply with local laws  identity residency of physical data  and language localization of identity ”strata’s global access orchestration recipes and capabilitiesthe first of strata’s global access recipes  “secure   control cross border access to a global resource ” is available now  strata’s maverics and additional global access orchestration recipes will provide the following capabilities support for region specific idps to provide users controlled access to common apps and keep international customer data compliant with local regulations to avoid gdpr  ccpa  and other region and country specific violations  maverics’ service extensions enable organizations to build multilingual customer journeys that keep customer data where it belongs protect global data from local data seizure in countries and regions with far reaching data privacy and access laws  the maverics cloud is available in six global regions  the us  canada  the uk  the eu  brazil  and australia  and can be used to set up multiple instances in different regions to control data policies at the local in country level provide cross region visibility into siloed identity data for accurate auditing with comprehensive reports demonstrating compliance with local data regulations improve performance and user experience using maverics’ distributed air gap architecture that enables identity orchestration to be deployed near apps and avoid round trip latency to access data provide users with a familiar log in experience to global resources they need while controlling region specific access in the background  behind the scenes  maverics evaluates the app policy and directs the user to their idp enable administrators to define the policy that enforces authentication to each idp and configure maverics as an authentication gateway to direct users to the appropriate idp availabilitythe maverics recipes for global access are available immediately from strata and its business partners worldwide about strata identitystrata identity is the leader in identity orchestration for multi cloud and hybrid cloud  the orchestration recipe powered maverics platform enables organizations to integrate and control incompatible identity systems with an identity fabric that does not change the user experience or require rewriting apps  by decoupling applications from identity  maverics makes it possible to implement modern authentication  like passwordless  and enforce consistent access policies without refactoring apps  the company’s founders created the idql

269,a chinese speaking threat actor codenamed goldfactory has been attributed to the development of highly sophisticated banking trojans  including a previously undocumented ios malware called goldpickaxe that s capable of harvesting identity documents  facial recognition data  and intercepting sms  the goldpickaxe family is available for both ios and android platforms   singapore headquartered group ib said in an extensive report shared with the hacker news   goldfactory is believed to be a well organized chinese speaking cybercrime group with close connections to gigabud  active since at least mid 2023  goldfactory is also responsible for another android based banking malware called golddigger and its enhanced variant golddiggerplus as well as goldkefu  an embedded trojan inside golddiggerplus social engineering campaigns distributing the malware have been found to target the asia pacific region  specifically thailand and vietnam  by masquerading as local banks and government organizations in these attacks  prospective victims are sent smishing and phishing messages and guided to switch the conversation to instant messaging apps like line  before sending bogus urls that lead to the deployment of goldpickaxe on the devices some of these malicious apps targeting android are hosted on counterfeit websites resembling google play store pages or fake corporate websites to complete the installation process goldpickaxe for ios  however  employs a different distribution scheme  with successive iterations leveraging apple s testflight platform and booby trapped urls that prompt users to download an mobile device management  mdm  profile to grant complete control over the ios devices and install the rogue app the sophistication of goldpickaxe is also evident in the fact that it s designed to get around security measures imposed by thailand that require users to confirm larger transactions using facial recognition to prevent fraud  goldpickaxe prompts the victim to record a video as a confirmation method in the fake application   security researchers andrey polovinkin and sharmine low said   the recorded video is then used as raw material for the creation of deepfake videos facilitated by face swapping artificial intelligence services  furthermore  the android and ios flavors of the malware are equipped to collect the victim s id documents and photos  intercept incoming sms messages  and proxy traffic through the compromised device  it s suspected that the goldfactory actors use their own devices to sign in to the bank application and perform unauthorized fund transfers that having said  the ios variant exhibits fewer functionalities when compared to its android counterpart owing to the closed nature of the ios operating system and relatively stricter nature of ios permissions the android version – considered an evolutionary successor of golddiggerplus – also poses as over 20 different applications from thailand s government  the financial sector  and utility companies to steal login credentials from these services  however  it s currently not clear what the threat actors do with this information another notable aspect of the malware is its abuse of android s accessibility services to log keystrokes and extract on screen content golddigger also shares code level similarities to goldpickaxe  although it is chiefly designed to steal banking credentials  while the latter is geared more towards gathering of personal information from victims  no golddigger artifacts aimed at ios devices have been identified to date  the primary feature of golddigger is that it targets over 50 applications from vietnamese financial companies  including their packages  names in the trojan   the researchers said   whenever the targeted applications open  it will save the text displayed or written on the ui  including passwords  when they are entered  the base version of golddigger  which was first discovered in june 2023 and continues to be still in circulation  has since paved the way for more upgraded variants  including golddiggerplus  which comes embedded with another trojan apk component dubbed goldkefu  to unleash the malicious actions golddiggerplus is said to have emerged in september 2023  with goldkefu impersonating a popular vietnamese messaging app to siphon banking credentials associated with 10 financial institutions the android trojan  which is used in conjunction with goldkefu  uses fake overlays to collect the login information if the most recently opened application belongs to the target list  unlike golddigger which relies mainly on android s accessibility services goldkefu also integrates with the agora software development kit  sdk  to facilitate interactive voice and video calls and trick victims into contacting a bogus bank customer service by sending fake alerts that induce a false sense of urgency by claiming that a fund transfer to the tune of 3 million thai baht has taken place on their accounts if anything  the development is a sign that the mobile malware landscape remains a lucrative market for cybercriminals looking for quick financial gain  even as they find ways to circumvent defensive measures erected by banks to counter such threats  it also demonstrates the ever shifting and dynamic nature of social engineering schemes that aim to deliver malware to victims  devices to mitigate the risks posed by goldfactory and its suite of mobile banking malware  it s strongly advised not to click on suspicious links  install any app from untrusted sites  as they are a common vector for malware  and periodically review the permissions given to apps  particularly those requesting for android s accessibility services  goldfactory is a resourceful team adept at various tactics  including impersonation  accessibility keylogging  fake banking websites  fake bank alerts  fake call screens  identity  and facial recognition data collection   the researchers said   the team comprises separate development and operator groups dedicated to specific regions   the gang has well defined processes and operational maturity and constantly enhances its toolset to align with the targeted environment showcasing a high proficiency in malware development  ,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack

271,cutting kids off from the dark web – the solution can only ever be socialexpert weighs in after brianna ghey murder amid worrying rates of child cybercrimethe murder of 16 year old schoolgirl brianna ghey has kickstarted a debate around limiting children s access to the dark web in the uk  with experts highlighting the difficulty in achieving this ciaran martin  the national cyber security centre s first ceo and current oxford university professor  weighed into the discussion on thursday  saying that there is no single technology based solution and that there should be a greater focus on the dark web in the country s schools the debate was spun up following an interview with esther ghey  mother to brianna  whose murder by two of her peers  also aged 16  has rocked the uk for the past year  it was revealed in the recent trial of brianna s two child killers that one had accessed real life torture and murder material on the  horror filled corner of the internet   as bbc radio 4 presenter nick robinson put it  which raised questions about the accessibility of the dark web for children in addition to criticizing the online safety act for not going far enough to protect children  ghey is also campaigning for social media to be banned on smartphones for those under 16 years of age  with this absolutely horrible case in mind  and everyone s heart must go out to the whole family  i think we would want to look seriously at what can be done   said martin  discussing access to the dark web on thursday s today show  there are technological limitations  so if you said  for example   just block access to dark web browsers   that s not really possible in the way that the uk internet works because communication service providers – if you re using one of these things – won t know what your ip address is  so there are technological limitations  but i don t want to be completely defeatist  he went on to highlight the uk s strict rules around hosting and propagating harmful content online  such as terrorist material  that are already in place just this week  a runcorn mechanic was sentenced to 16 years in prison for running the annex child abuse site – an example of the country s intolerance of this sort of activity  of course  we criminalize the possession of child  sex abuse  images  which are often from the dark web   martin added   but also i think there is a danger in trying to declare that there must be a technological solution to problems that often have a technological aspect  including what technology does to our minds  but they also have a deeply sociological aspect  so parents will need to be asking their children if they know what the dark web is and if they re using it  they could be searching devices for tor  we educate children in schools about sharing indecent images when they re underage  we should be educating them about the dark web as well  it s a really complicated problem with no single tech solution  one of the obvious difficulties of limiting access to the dark web for anyone in the uk is the tor browser  required for accessing corners of the deep web and the dark web the fact that it s also used for benign and legitimate reasons also presents an argument to not limit its availability  tor and the deep web enables people to anonymously access information and resources unavailable to those who live in authoritarian governments  for example  or those in war torn countries such as ukraine when it comes to the online safety act  concern remains that one particular passage  section 122  pdf   allows ofcom to demand that online service providers scan online communications  which would effectively not allow the implementation of encryption is your kid a little cybercriminal the today show debate comes against the backdrop of concerns among uk authorities about children increasingly engaging in cybercrime   fyi  tor browser is very much still a thing and getting updates  dea nabs  150m from dark web drug lord based    in coventry  walmart runs creepy  advergame  on roblox  where kids can make toy wish lists  children should have separate sections in social media sites  says uk coronerthe national crime agency  nca  issued a call on thursday for parents and teachers to take a proactive role in educating young people about the dangers of engaging in cybercrime the nca has spent years consistently campaigning to raise awareness of cybercriminal behavior among the younger population  it previously pinpointed 12 to 15 year old boys as the primary target of education efforts  and noticed the average age of suspects subject to cybercrime investigations was 17 now the authority says one in five  20 percent  of children in the uk aged between ten and 16 have demonstrated behavior that would violate the computer misuse act 1990  cma   the figure is slightly higher for those who are active gamers  it added  with one in four exhibiting illegal behaviors many children may not be aware of the criminality associated with their actions  especially with low level offences  but there exists a very real potential for this activity to grow into more serious cybercrime for gamers  even buying a skin for their in game character using their parents  saved credit card details without consent would be a violation of the cma  using off the shelf tools to perform ddos attacks  for example  or accessing a protected server are other common examples of these low level offenses being found guilty under the cma can have serious consequences for young offenders that could impact their employability in later life by having a criminal record or being expelled from school  or both the nca is aligned with martin s recommendation that the first port of call should be to focus on education from a young age  nurturing a child s curiosity and skills in positive ways call us immediately if your child uses kali linux  squawks west mids policeread more many young people are getting involved in cybercrime without realizing that they are breaking the law  our message to these teenagers is simple – don t play games with your future   said paul foster  nca deputy director and head of the national cyber crime unit  whether you engage in this behavior knowingly or without realizing  you are committing an offense – and could face serious consequences for your actions  we d encourage any concerned parents and teachers to speak to young people with an interest in tech  help them understand the dangers  and highlight the many rewarding and varied careers available to them

272,breaking cybersecurity news  news analysis  commentary  and other content from around the world  with an initial focus on the middle east   africa a spate of recent cyber espionage attacks showcases turla s brand new modular custom malware  and an expansion of the state sponsored group s scope of targets february 15  2024russia sponsored advanced persistent threat group  apt  turla is now targeting polish ngos in a cyberespionage campaign that uses a freshly developed backdoor with modular capabilities  signaling an expansion of the scope of its attacks against supporters of the ukrainian war effort according to a cisco talos blog post published today on turla  aka snake  urobouros  venomous bear  or waterbug   the backdoor used in the attacks  dubbed  tinyturla ng   has functionalities very much like the apt s known custom malware  the similarly named tinyturla  it acts as a  last chance  backdoor  that is left behind to be used when all other unauthorized access backdoor mechanisms have failed or been detected on the infected systems   cisco talos researchers wrote in the post tinyturla ng custom malware goes modularlike tinyturla before it  tinyturla ng is a service dll that s started via svchost exe  however  the code of the malware is new  and different malware features are distributed via different threads in the implementation process  something that sets it apart from its predecessor the apt also hosts different powershell scripts and arbitrary commands that can be executed on the victim machine according to the attackers  needs  another deviation from previous backdoor capabilities  the researchers said  and  it provides added capabilities such as such as the execution of commands via choice of two mechanisms — powershell or windows command line interface  this indicates that turla is modularizing their malware into various components  likely to avoid detection and blocking of a single bulky backdoor responsible for everything on the infected endpoint   a cisco talos researcher told dark reading tinyturla ng also deploys a previously unknown powershell based implant dubbed turlapower ng aimed specifically at exfiltrating files that may be of interest to attackers  signaling another shift in the apt s tactics  in the attacks on polish ngos  turla used the powershell implant to secure the password databases of popular management software   indicating a concerted effort for turla to steal login credentials   the researcher says turla  old dog  old   new tricksturla is an experienced apt  operating for a number of years in attacks believed to be on behalf of the russian government  the group has used zero days  legitimate software  and other techniques to deploy backdoors in systems belonging to militaries and governments  diplomatic entities  and technology and research organizations  in one case  it was even linked  through its kazuar backdoor  to the now infamous solarwinds breach the earliest compromise date of this latest campaign against ukraine supporting polish ngos was dec  18  and it remained active until as recently as jan  27 of this year  according to researchers  there are some indications  however  that it could have even started earlier  in november though tinyturla ng and turlapower ng are new forms of custom turla malware used in the campaign  the group continues to employ old tactics as well  particularly for command and control  c2   for instance  it continues to leverage compromised wordpress based websites as c2s to host and operate the malware  the operators use different websites running vulnerable wordpress versions  versions including 4 4 20  5 0 21  5 1 18 and 5 7 2   which allowed the upload of php files containing the c2 code   according to the post defending against sophisticated apt cyberattackscisco talos included a list of both hashes and domains in its list of indicators of compromise  iocs  for the latest turla campaign  as well as a list of security solutions that can provide coverage for organizations worried about being targeted overall  the researchers recommend that organizations use  a layered defense model  that allows for detection and blocking of malicious activity from initial compromise to final payload deployment to defend against sophisticated apt threats  the cisco talos researcher says  it is imperative that organizations detect and protect against such highly motivated and sophisticated adversaries across multiple attack surfaces   the researcher says cisco talos also recommends that organizations use hands on keyboard activities such as archiving of files of interest and subsequent exfiltration to further protect themselves against targeted attacks about the author s you may also like,emerging

281,news  news analysis  and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology an exploratory research proposal is recommending regulation of ai chips and stronger governance measures to keep up with the rapid technical innovations in artificial intelligence february 16  2024researchers from openai  cambridge university  harvard university  and university of toronto offered  exploratory  ideas on how to regulate ai chips and hardware  and how security policies could prevent the abuse of advanced ai the recommendations provide ways to measure and audit the development and use of advanced ai systems and the chips that power them  policy enforcement recommendations include limiting the performance of systems and implementing security features that can remotely disable rogue chips  training highly capable ai systems currently requires accumulating and orchestrating thousands of ai chips   the researchers wrote    i f these systems are potentially dangerous  then limiting this accumulated computing power could serve to limit the production of potentially dangerous ai systems  governments have largely focused on software for ai policy  and the paper is a companion piece covering the hardware side of the debate  says nathan brookwood  principal analyst of insight 64 however  the industry will not welcome any security features that affect the performance of ai  he warns  making ai safe through hardware  is a noble aspiration  but i can t see any one of those making it  the genie is out of the lamp and good luck getting it back in   he says throttling connections between clustersone of the proposals the researchers suggest is a cap to limit the compute processing capacity available to ai models  the idea is to put security measures in place that can identify abuse of ai systems  and cutting off and limiting the use of chips specifically  they suggest a targeted approach of limiting the bandwidth between memory and chip clusters  the easier alternative — to cut off access to chips — wasn’t ideal as it would affect overall ai performance  the researchers wrote the paper did not suggest ways to implement such security guardrails or how abuse of ai systems could be detected  determining the optimal bandwidth limit for external communication is an area that merits further research   the researchers wrote large scale ai systems demand tremendous network bandwidth  and ai systems such as microsoft s eagle and nvidia s eos are among the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world  ways to limit network performance do exist for devices supporting the p4 programming language  which can analyze network traffic and reconfigure routers and switches but good luck asking chip makers to implement ai security mechanisms that could slow down chips and networks  brookwood says  arm  intel  and amd are all busy building the fastest  meanest chips they can build to be competitive  i don t know how you can slow down   he says remote possibilities carry some riskthe researchers also suggested disabling chips remotely  which is something that intel has built into its newest server chips  the on demand feature is a subscription service that will allow intel customers to turn on chip features such as ai extensions on and off like heated seats in a tesla the researchers also suggested an attestation scheme where chips allow only authorized parties to access ai systems via cryptographically signed digital certificates  firmware could provide guidelines on authorized users and applications  which could be changed with

283,february 16  2024commentaryone of the few pieces of information that is truly immutable and potentially invaluable is genetic information  we can t change our genome to any large degree  unlike biometric data  which may be stored in any number of different algorithmic or hashed structures  genetic information can be invariably reduced to simple sequences of amino acid pairs  the nightmare scenario  then  is bad actors hacking a genetic database and getting access to the biological blueprints to large numbers of people recently  that nightmare came true with the hack of genetic testing company 23andme  attackers used classic credential stuffing techniques to illegally access 14 000 user accounts  but they didn t stop there  because of sharing features of 23andme that enable users to share and read data of other users who might be related  the hackers were able to extract genetic data from 6 9 million people  the attackers posted offers on the dark web for 1 million profiles  23andme did not disclose the full impact until a month after the attack to protect users  23andme is prompting all users to immediately change their passwords and ensure they are unique and complex  this is good but insufficient  more important  the company is automatically enrolling existing customers into two factor authentication for an extra layer of security  rather than wait for the inevitable catastrophic event  every single software as a service  saas  app should make 2fa mandatory and best practices should be moved from 2fa to mfa with a minimum of three factors available  it s now a matter of public safety and should be mandatory  just as car manufacturers must include seat belts and airbags in their vehicles network effects multiply impacts of compromisemany of our accounts and saas applications include networked capabilities that increase exposure exponentially  in the case of 23andme  exposed data included information from dna relatives profiles  5 5 million  and family tree profiles  1 4 million  that the 14 000 account users had shared or made accessible  this information included locations  display names  relationship labels  and dna shared with matches  as well as birth years and locations for some users  while the market value of dna data for hackers remains unclear  its uniqueness and irreplaceable nature raise concerns about potential misuse and targeting in the future replace 23andme with dropbox  outlook  or slack  and you can easily see how a relatively small number of exposed accounts can yield data for an entire organization  access to an outlook account might yield the names and social connections  along with interactions that could be useful for building more believable social engineering attacks this isn t a minor threat  we are increasingly seeing savvy attackers looking for more weakly guarded applications that have considerable networked information to execute broader attacks  according to the 2023 ibm x force 2023 threat intelligence index  41  of successful attacks used phishing and social engineering as their primary vector  for example  the okta session token incident looked to take advantage of weaker security on its customer support and ticketing system as a means to gather information for phishing attacks against customers  the costs of these attacks are rising and can be staggering  ibm estimates the average breach cost over  4 million and the market capitalization of okta plummeted billions of dollars after announcing the breach a long overdue fix  mandatory 2fa for loginsthe 23andme hack hammers home an obvious truth  username and password combinations aren t only inherently insecure but essentially uninsurable and an unacceptable risk  even assuming that a password alone provides security is foolish  in security and other certification processes  any company that fails to enable automated 2fa enrollment should be flagged as risky to provide the necessary risk information to partners  investors  customers  and government bodies the 2fa must be mandatory and enforced as the price of entry for any saas application — no exceptions  some organizations might complain that such a mandate will introduce additional friction and negatively impact user experience  but innovative application designers have largely solved these problems by building from first principles under the assumption that their users will be required to use 2fa  what s more  numerous leading organizations like github have rolled out 2fa mandates  so there s no shortage of examples of how talented ux teams are handling the challenge curiously  the same claims of friction and inconvenience were once the staple complaint against seat belt mandates  today  no one blinks  and seat belts are widely accepted  in that same vein  seat belts and airbags for saas apps will  in the end  save the world many billions of dollars in reduced losses and increased productivity what about passkeys  unfortunately  they re unlikely to hit critical mass in enterprise for years to come  and passkeys are even more secure when paired with mfa  the challenge  then  will be on saas makers to up their usability game and make 2fa and mfa even easier for everyone to use — especially more secure factors such as biometrics  hardware keys  and authenticator apps genetic data is the canary in the saas security coal mine  as more and more of our lives and activities go online  more risk accrues to businesses and consumers alike  building greater security into saas is a public good that will benefit everyone  the best and most obvious step right now is mandating 2fa as a baseline level of security about the author s you may also like,news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,"{'vulnerability

287,with breaches making the headlines on an almost weekly basis  the cybersecurity challenges we face are becoming visible not only to large enterprises  who have built security capabilities over the years  but also to small to medium businesses and the broader public  while this is creating greater awareness among smaller businesses of the need to improve their security posture  smbs are often left facing a gap in the market  unable to find security tooling that is both easy for them to use and which they can afford when we consider the needs of smbs  we need to focus both on the development of threat intelligence  which is necessary to understand and identify the threats being faced  as well as the tools used to provide protection  nttsh has built a pedigree of over 20 years  experience in the research and curation of threat intelligence as well as the development of capabilities and products which leverage its threat intelligence to protect customers  after many years of focus on larger enterprises  nttsh is moving to democratize cybersecurity and provide smaller businesses with the protection they require global threat intelligence centerall of nttsh s efforts are underpinned by the capabilities of its global threat intelligence center  gtic   the efforts of the gtic go beyond those of a pure research organization by taking threat research and combining it with nttsh proprietary detective technology to produce applied threat intelligence the gtic s mission is to protect clients by providing advanced threat research and security intelligence  enabling nttsh to prevent  detect  and respond to cyber threats  to provide a truly unique vantage point within nttsh s products and services  gtic leverages proprietary intelligence capabilities and ntt s position

organizations better adapt to the evolving threat landscape  in the q3 update of the 2023 gtir  a special focus was placed on key industry verticals  providing insights into the threats they face threat focus by sectorthe healthcare sector faces a unique set of challenges  not only due to the high value of the information owned by healthcare providers but also as a result of steep growth in the adoption of technology in healthcare in a context where many providers  especially smaller ones  lack awareness of cybersecurity and also don t have the resources to deploy and maintain the kinds of controls enjoyed by large enterprises  ransomware is still proving particularly problematic  healthcare ransomware breaches are proving to be particularly concentrated across a few geographies  with the usa  australia  and the uk accounting for close to 80  of these breaches  figure 1  ransomware victim locations in the healthcare sector a similar geographic trend is visible in the telecommunications sector  where the usa  uk  and australia account for roughly 52  of ransomware attacks  while in education  the usa  uk  and canada account for approximately 83  across all of the focus sectors  lockbit 3 0 remains the most prolific ransomware threat actor  some ransomware actors are  however  focusing on specific sectors  such as the bl00dy ransomware gang  which specifically targets education  figure 2  top ransomware actors in the telecommunications sectorsecurity challenges of saasa recent area of focus for gtic has been the way in which the rapidly accelerating adoption of saas is presenting its own set of challenges  saas is rapidly becoming an integral part of the day to day operations of both small and large businesses  with annual growth expected to continue at a rate of close to 20  through 2027  in this context  it is important to note that 99  of cloud security breaches are expected to be the customer s fault  according to gartner the shared responsibility model for cloud services has been something that larger enterprises have been familiar with for some time already  smaller organizations are  however  still coming to grips with this model  in respect of saas  this means that while the cloud provider is responsible for the application  smbs are still adapting to the fact that they retain responsibility for their data and  crucially  manage their accounts and identities  threat actors are  as a result  focusing on ways to compromise identities  especially using techniques such as credential stuffing and phishing facing up to the challenges of hybrid itwhile smbs were previously able to rely on antivirus software and firewalls to protect the technology assets on their premises  most have now moved into the world of hybrid it as they increasingly rely on cloud delivered services  while the security controls provided by most cloud services are good  smbs face a variety of challenges in using the security functionality that is available to them as the attack surface of even smaller companies expands  the number of sources of security alerting grows  that is not the only challenge  threat actors will often not confine their activities to one part of your technology estate  they may start in one area  for instance  by compromising one or more endpoints  such as laptops  and then use the information they gather  such as credentials  to move laterally  for instance  to compromise a saas application  while large enterprises have spent the last 10 years or more building dedicated secops teams and intricate security toolchains  smbs lack the resources for this kind of investment democratizing security operations with xdrwhat smbs need is the ability to bring alerting from all of their it infrastructure and applications into a single tool  which can analyze all of an organization s telemetry  apply threat intelligence  and then provide a simple interface that acts as a single pane of glass for managing alerting  performing investigations and responding to threats  this is where xdr provides a solution that combines the key components of a traditional secops toolchain in a single cloud hosted application  which can be delivered affordably  this is the second key area where nttsh has turned its focus towards smbs by focusing the development of its samurai xdr product on the needs and budgets of smbs while still delivering the functionality that large enterprises have become accustomed to  while gtic s research provides the intelligence needed to understand and detect the threats facing modern organizations  samurai xdr makes gtic s work accessible and actionable even for organizations that lack dedicated secops resources  it is crucial to remember that while threat intelligence is essential to be able to detect threats  every organization needs tools in order to apply it a brief journey through samurai xdrfrom the start  samurai xdr is designed to be easy to use and  most importantly  to be accessible to all it staff  not only to security analysts  the starting point of all workflows in samurai xdr is the alerts dashboard  this is where the system presents security alerts which have been prioritized based on severity and confidence  figure 3  samurai xdr alerts dashboardthe alerts dashboard brings together alerts from all of the technologies used by the organization into a single prioritized view  with a focus on providing an intuitive interface that can be used by most it staff  not only by specialist security analysts once the user has decided that an alert warrants further investigation  the investigations view provides a similarly simple and intuitive interface for managing the lifecycle of an investigation of a potential security incident once events and alerts are processed  they are stored in samurai xdr s data lake  the data lake provides the ability for users to query and analyze all of the events ingested into samurai xdr  going back up to one full year  this makes it possible to interrogate a full year s historical data for purposes such as threat hunting   allowing samurai xdr users to perform detailed analyses of historical events for any signs of threats that may have been dwelling for longer periods of time  querying the events in the data lake is made possible by samurai xdr s advanced query function  which allows users to search the data lake both graphically and using microsoft s kusto query language  kql  integrationsintegrations provide the mechanism to ingest telemetry  such as logs  from your it infrastructure and applications into samurai xdr  nttsh has focused on bringing together the right mix of capabilities to ingest telemetry from both on premises infrastructure and cloud services  mirroring the kind of hybrid it environment that has become typical for even most smbs today  some examples of integrations currently available include   cloud  azure management plane and microsoft 365  coming soon   google workspace  coming soon   endpoint detection and response  microsoft defender for endpoint  vmware carbon black and crowdstrike falcon insight  next generation firewalls  cisco secure firewall  asa and firepower threat defense   fortinet fortigate  and palo alto networks ngfw over the coming months  nttsh will be busy adding more integrations  including but not limited to meraki  bitdefender  sophos  zoom  malwarebytes  onelogin  okta  zscaler  aws  and many more making it easya key area of focus for nttsh in the development of samurai xdr has been that of making it easy to use and easy to afford  for example  the configuration of integrations is supported by simple  point and click  workflows  for infrastructure that provides logs via syslog  all that is needed is to point the log source at samurai xdr s secure syslog collector  and samurai xdr will do the work of detecting the kind of device that is sending logs  naturally  it s the same for cloud integrations  samurai xdr keeps the steps to a minimum and guides the user through interactive steps and access to knowledge base articles samurai xdr also follows a simple pricing model   based solely on the number of endpoints that the customer has  removing the need to try to estimate the data volumes of the telemetry that will be ingested into the platform  standard pricing for 50 endpoints or more is only  3 33 per endpoint per month  and for smaller customers  there is a starter pack for up to 25 endpoints  which is priced at  750 for a year to make it easy to try out samurai xdr  nttsh is providing all new customers with a free 30 day trial  making it possible to experience all of its functionality without any commitments  giving even the smallest smbs a risk free route

2023  sustained until the end of the year  which is mostly attributed to money laundering  based on chainalysis data  roughly one third of all yomix inflows have come from wallets associated with crypto hacks   reads the report chainalysis also says that last year it noticed a trend concerning the concentration of money laundering activities at a few fiat off ramping services  with 71 7  of all illicit funds directed to just five services however  at the deposit address level  money laundering became less concentrated  suggesting that criminals are diversifying their activities to avoid

294,how to weaponize llms to auto hijack websiteswe speak to professor who with colleagues tooled up openai s gpt 4 and other neural netsai models  the subject of ongoing safety concerns about harmful and biased output  pose a risk beyond content emission  when wedded with tools that enable automated interaction with other systems  they can act on their own as malicious agents computer scientists affiliated with the university of illinois urbana champaign  uiuc  have demonstrated this by weaponizing several large language models  llms  to compromise vulnerable websites without human guidance  prior research suggests llms can be used  despite safety controls  to assist  pdf  with the creation of malware researchers richard fang  rohan bindu  akul gupta  qiusi zhan  and daniel kang went a step further and showed that llm powered agents – llms provisioned with tools for accessing apis  automated web browsing  and feedback based planning – can wander the web on their own and break into buggy web apps without oversight they describe their findings in a paper titled   llm agents can autonomously hack websites   in this work  we show that llm agents can autonomously hack websites  performing complex tasks without prior knowledge of the vulnerability   the uiuc academics explain in their paper  for example  these agents can perform complex sql union attacks  which involve a multi step process  38 actions  of extracting a database schema  extracting information from the database based on this schema  and performing the final hack  in an interview with the register  daniel kang  assistant professor at uiuc  emphasized that he and his co authors did not actually let their malicious llm agents loose on the world  the tests  he said  were done on real websites in a sandboxed environment to ensure no harm would be done and no personal information would be compromised what we found is that gpt 4 is highly capable of these tasks  every open source model failed  and gpt 3 5 is only marginally better than the open source models the openai assistants api is basically used to have context  to do the function calling  and many of the other things like document retrieval that are really important for high performance  landchain was basically used to wrap it all up  and the playwright web browser testing framework was used to actually interact with websites  the researchers created agents using 10 different llms  gpt 4  gpt 3 5  openhermes 2 5 mistral 7b  llama 2 chat  70b   llama 2 chat  13b   llama 2 chat  7b   mixtral 8x7b instruct  mistral  7b  instruct v0 2  nous hermes 2 yi  34b   and openchat 3 5 the first two  gpt 4 and gpt 3 5  are proprietary models operated by openai while the remaining eight are open source  google s gemini model  said to be at least as capable as gpt 4 in its latest iteration  was not available at the time the researchers had their llm agents probe test websites for 15 vulnerabilities  including sql injection  cross site scripting  and cross site request forgery  among others  the open source models that were tested all failed but openai s gpt 4 had an overall success rate of 73 3 percent with five passes and 42 7 percent with one pass  the second place contender  openai s gpt 3 5  eked out a success rate of only 6 7 percent with five passes and 2 7 percent with one pass  that s one of the things we find very surprising   said kang   so depending on who you talk to  this might be called scaling law or an emergent capability  what we found is that gpt 4 is highly capable of these tasks  every open source model failed  and gpt 3 5 is only marginally better than the open source models    ftc asks normal folks if they d like ai impersonation scam protection  too  someone had to say it  scientists propose ai apocalypse kill switches  ai won t take our jobs and it might even save the middle class  republican senators try to outlaw rules that restrict wall street s use of aione explanation cited in the paper is that gpt 4 was better able to change its actions based on the response it got from the target website than the open source models kang said it s difficult to be certain why that s the case   qualitatively speaking  we found that the open source models are not nearly as good at function calling as the openai models  he also cited the need to process large contexts  prompts    gpt 4 needs to take up to 50 actions  if you include backtracking  to accomplish some of these hacks and this requires a lot of context to actually perform   he explained   we found that the open source models were not nearly as good as gpt 4 for long contexts  backtracking refers to having a model revert to its previous state to try another approach when confronted with an error the researchers conducted a cost analysis of attacking websites with llm agents and found the software agent is far more affordable than hiring a penetration tester  to estimate the cost of gpt 4  we performed five runs using the most capable agent  document reading and detailed prompt  and measured the total cost of the input and output tokens   the paper says   across these 5 runs  the average cost was  4 189  with an overall success rate of 42 7 percent  this would total  9 81 per website  assuming that a human security analyst paid  100 000 annually  or  50 an hour  would take about 20 minutes to check a website manually  the researchers say a live pen tester would cost about  80 or eight times the cost of an llm agent  kang said that while these numbers are highly speculative  he expects llms will be incorporated into penetration testing regimes in the coming years asked whether cost might be a gating factor to prevent the widespread use of llm agents for automated attacks  kang said that may be somewhat true today but he expects costs will fall kang said that while traditional safety concerns related to biased and harmful training data and model output are obviously very important  the risk expands when llms get turned into agents agents are what really scares me in terms of future safety concerns agents are what really scares me in terms of future safety concerns   he said   some of the vulnerabilities that we tested on  you can actually find today using automatic scanners  you can find that they exist  but you can t autonomously exploit them using the automated scanner  at least as far as i m aware of  you aren t able to actually autonomously leverage that information  what really worries me about future highly capable models is the ability to do autonomous hacks and self reflection to try multiple different strategies at scale  asked whether he has any advice for developers  industry  and policy makers  kang said   the first thing is just think very carefully about what these models could potentially be used for   he also argued for safe harbor guarantees to allow security researchers to continue this kind of research  along with responsible disclosure agreements midjourney  he said  had banned some researchers and journalists who pointed out their models appeared to be using copyrighted material  openai  he said  has been generous by not banning his account the register asked openai to comment on the researchers  findings   we take the safety of our products seriously and are continually improving our safety measures based on how people use our products   a spokesperson told us  we don t want our tools to be used for malicious purposes  and we are always working on how we can make our systems more robust against this type of abuse  we thank the researchers for sharing their work with us  openai earlier downplayed gpt 4 s abilities in aiding cyberattacks  saying the model  offers only limited  incremental capabilities for malicious

according to the idc  more than three quarters of cisos in the region are planning to increase budgets by at least 10  this year  spurred in large part by geopolitical threats  the growth of generative ai  and increasing data protection regulations across the region  the increase in successful cybercrimes has driven demand for consulting services in non core countries where awareness is not as high compared to the core countries   says yotasha thaver  a research analyst for it security data at idc south africa and meta   there is also a push coming from governments — particularly in the middle east — for improved cybersecurity  the spending of course will vary by country  for instance  both saudi arabia and the united arab emirates  uae   which are actively investing in national

and groups see the benefits of using generative ai tools  which will complicate the security teams  job of protecting the enterprise from data leaks and compliance and privacy violations there is significant interest among organizations in using generative ai  genai  tools for a wide range of use cases  according to dark reading s first ever survey about genai  many different groups within enterprises can use this technology  but these tools seems to be most commonly in use by data analytics  cybersecurity  research  and marketing teams almost a third of the respondents say their organizations have pilot programs or are otherwise exploring the use of genai tools  while 29  say they are still considering whether to use these tools  just 22  say their organizations are actively using genai tools  and 17  say they are in the process of implementation security teams are looking at how these activities can be incorporated into their day to day operations  especially for writing code  looking for reference information related to specific threat indicators and issues  and automating investigative tasks meanwhile  marketing and sales groups most often use ai generators to create first drafts of text documents or develop personalized marketing messages and summarize text documents  product and service groups have begun leaning on genai for identifying trends in customer

which will have to choose  cyber teams can follow cisa s advice and disconnect ivanti vpn appliances and update before they are reconnected  or  while they re already offline for patching  they can replace ivanti appliances altogether with fully updated gear however  some say that sticking with ivanti is a juice that may not be worth the squeeze   these devices need their software engineered

296,february 17  2024the russia aligned threat group known as winter vivern was discovered exploiting cross site scripting  xss  vulnerabilities in roundcube webmail servers across europe in october — and now its victims are coming to light the group mainly targeted government  military  and national infrastructure in georgia  poland  and ukraine  according to recorded future s insikt group report on the campaign released today the report also highlighted additional targets  including the embassy of iran in moscow  the embassy of iran in the netherlands  and the embassy of georgia in sweden utilizing sophisticated social engineering techniques  the apt  which insikt calls tag 70 and which is also known as ta473  and uac 0114  used a roundcube zero day exploit to gain unauthorized access to targeted mail servers across at least 80 separate organizations  ranging from the transport and education sectors to chemical and biological research organizations the campaign is thought to have been deployed to gather intelligence on european political and military affairs  potentially to gain strategic advantages or undermine european security and alliances  according to insikt the group is suspected of conducting cyber espionage campaigns serving the interests of belarus and russia  and has been active since at least december 2020 winter vivern s geopolitical motivations for cyber espionagethe october campaign was linked to tag 70 s previous activity against uzbekistan government mail servers  reported by insikt group in february 2023 an obvious motivation for the ukrainian targeting is the conflict with russia  in the context of the ongoing war in ukraine  compromised email servers may expose sensitive information regarding ukraine s war effort and planning  its relationships  and negotiations with its partner countries as it seeks additional military and economic assistance   which  expose third parties cooperating with the ukrainian government privately  and reveal fissures within the coalition supporting ukraine   the insikt report noted meanwhile  the focus on iranian embassies in russia and the netherlands could be tied to a motive to evaluate iran s ongoing diplomatic engagements and foreign policy positions  particularly considering iran s involvement in supporting russia in the conflict in ukraine similarly  the espionage targeting the georgian embassy in sweden and the georgian ministry of defense probably stems from comparable foreign policy driven objectives  especially as georgia has revitalized its pursuit of european union membership and nato accession in the aftermath of russia s incursion into ukraine in early 2022 other notable targets included organizations involved in the logistics and transportation industries  which is telling based on the context of the war in ukraine  as robust logistics networks have proved crucial for both sides in maintaining their ability to fight cyber espionage defense is difficultcyber espionage campaigns have been ramping up  earlier this month  a sophisticated russian apt launched a targeted powershell attack campaign against the ukrainian military  while another russian apt  turla  targeted polish ngos using a novel backdoor malware ukraine has also launched its own cyberattacks against russia  targeting the servers of moscow internet service provider m9 telecom in january  in retaliation for the russia backed breach of kyivstar mobile phone operator but the insikt group report noted that defending against attacks like these can be difficult  especially in the case of zero day vulnerability exploitation however  organizations can mitigate the impact of compromise by encrypting emails and considering alternative forms of secure communications for the transmission of particularly sensitive information it s also crucial to ensure that all servers and software are patched and kept up to date  and users should only open emails from trusted contacts organizations should also limit the amount of sensitive information stored on mail servers by practicing good hygiene and reducing data retention and restrict sensitive information and conversations to more secure high side systems whenever possible the report also noted that responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities  particularly those exploited by apt actors such as tag 70  is crucial for several reasons a threat intelligence analyst at recorded future s insikt group explained via email this approach ensures vulnerabilities are patched and rectified quickly before others discover and abuse them  and enables containment of exploits by sophisticated attackers  preventing broader and more rapid harm  ultimately  this approach addresses the immediate risks and encourages long term improvements in global cybersecurity practices   the analyst explained about the author s you may also like,emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack

magika  an in house machine learning powered file identifier  as part of its ai cyber defense initiative  which aims to give it network defenders and others better automated tools working out the true contents of a user submitted file is perhaps harder than it looks  it s not safe to assume the file type from  say  its extension  and relying on heuristics and human crafted rules – such as those in the widely used libmagic – to identify the actual nature of a document from its data is  in google s view   time consuming and error prone  basically  if someone uploads a  jpg to your online service  you want to be sure it s a jpeg image and not some script masquerading as one  which could later bite you in the ass  enter magika  which uses a trained model to rapidly identify file types from file data  and it s an approach the big g thinks works well enough to use in production  magika is  we re told  used by gmail  google drive  chrome s safe browsing  and virustotal to properly identify and

learning model could be useful for anyone who needs to scan user provided documents  videos that are actually executables  for instance  ought to set off some alarm and require closer inspection  email attachments that aren t what they say they are ought to be quarantined  you get the idea more generally speaking  in the context of cybersecurity  ai models can not only inspect files for suspicious content and source code for vulnerabilities  they can also generate patches to fix bugs  the googlers asserted  the mega corp s engineers have been experimenting with gemini to improve the automated fuzzing of open source projects  too google claims magika is 50 percent more accurate at identifying file types than the biz s previous system of handcrafted rules  takes milliseconds to identify a file type  and is said to have at least 99 percent accuracy in tests  it isn t perfect  however  and fails to classify file types about three percent of the time  it s licensed under apache

303,efficient communication is a cornerstone of business success  internally  making sure your team communicates seamlessly helps you avoid friction losses  misunderstandings  delays  and overlaps  externally  frustration free customer communication is directly correlated to a positive customer experience and higher satisfaction however  business communication channels are also a major target for cybercriminals  in recent years  especially since the pandemic  the number of cyberattacks has skyrocketed  statistics show that last year alone  the number of hacks shot up by 38   worse  it still takes a business 277 days on average to identify a breach  causing a loss of  4 35 on average so  how can businesses safeguard their communication channels against hackers  while still providing the best possible experience for customers and maintaining team productivity  here s everything you need to know – and which mistakes you need to avoid use secure platformsto begin with  there is your choice of communication channels  in order to meet customers  communication demands  you ll need to offer a variety of channels  from texting  email and live chat to voice and video calls  not to mention the channels for internal business communication  messaging  and team collaboration tools foremost among them in the choice of all these channels  you need to prioritize security  when comparing communication platforms  whether ucaas providers or contact center software  it s crucial to take their security standards into account have they been breached before  what server infrastructure and encryption do they rely on  what cybersecurity protocols do they implement  do they comply with international data security regulations  do they offer additional security measures such as two factor authentication all these are questions you should find the answers to before settling for any communication platform for your business audit your passwords and permissionsnext up  your business needs to audit its passwords and review which team members have which permissions incredible as it may sound  statistics show that a vast majority of data breaches  fully 80    are due to compromised login credentials  they also reveal that 75  of people do not adhere to password best practices  despite knowing better in fact   123456    password   and  admin  still remain on the list of the most frequently used passwords in 2024 increasing password complexity dramatically reduces the risk of successful cyber breaches  that s why a thorough password review and the implementation of draconic password standards should be high up on your list of priorities to safeguard your business communications as for the review of permissions  the more people have access to a system  the more likely it is that someone will make a mistake that could result in a breach  make sure that only those people who really need it have access to sensitive information invest in cybersecurity protectionanother strategy to protect your business communications against hackers is to invest in cybersecurity tools with the skyrocketing rates of cyber crime and the adoption of technologies such as ai by hackers  cybersecurity companies have ratcheted up their efforts to provide tools to fend them off review what cybersecurity tools your company uses  a solid antivirus system  a virtual private network  vpn  solution and a  team  password manager or vault combined with a strong password policy should be the absolute minimum going further  you can invest in financial fraud monitoring  identity theft monitoring for your team members  as well as spam call protection cybersecurity monitoring tools  especially  are underutilized by businesses – a major reason for the often months long delay in detecting a breach  in the event of a hack  it is crucial that you detect it as soon as possible in order to be able to limit the damage and loss of customer trust brush up your team s cybersecurity skillsthe vast majority of successful cyber breaches are due to human error and not just the choice of weak passwords phishing attacks in particular have become more sophisticated in recent years  long gone are the days in which a nigerian prince stuck at an airport reached out for a loan instead  you get an email from your supervisor towards the end of the business day because he needs your login credentials for a high level operation or you get a message on slack from a colleague two departments over with a link to sign the virtual birthday card for sarah from accounting if hackers really go above and beyond  you might even get a call from your company s ceo asking for your help with a technical issue in all these cases  many wouldn t think twice about handing over information or clicking the link they re sent  without thinking about spear or voice phishing  and today  that s all it takes to throw the door wide open for cybercriminals to make their way quietly into your communication systems to prevent any of these scenarios from happening  you need to brush up your team s cybersecurity skills – and their capacities to detect and flag fraud  having regular cybersecurity training is crucial  as is doing spot checks to make sure everyone adheres to best practices develop sops and a cybersecurity routinefinally  to protect your business  communication channels from hackers  it s essential to develop standard operating procedures and a fixed cybersecurity routine your sops should cover not only how to protect your systems  but also what to do in the event of a breach  or the suspicion of one  all your team members should be able to spot suspicious activity and know exactly who to reach out to in the event that they do who do they need to alert if they get a spear phishing message to their work phone what s the procedure if databases are behaving oddly which systems need to be shut down first to contain a potential breach all these are questions that need to be clarified and communicated to your team similarly  uncomfortable as it is  you also need to develop backup plans for the worst case scenario of a successful breach  what s your strategy to recover your website if it has been taken hostage  and how do you alert customers to a potential threat finally  you need to incorporate cybersecurity into your routines on a daily  weekly  quarterly  and annual basis  cybercriminals constantly evolve their tactics  and you need to keep up to speed to protect your communications this means staying up to date on cybersecurity news  new threats  and scams  it also involves regular changes to your passwords  system reviews  and updates to your sops conclusionprotecting your business communications against hackers is a complex task  it starts with your choice of platforms and cybersecurity tools  but requires constant vigilance  it s crucial to regularly audit your passwords and permissions  educate yourself and your team  and develop cybersecurity sops and routines while all of this takes a considerable amount of time  effort  and resources  it is well worth it  the alternative is to leave yourself wide open and vulnerable to attacks that can have serious financial consequences and result in a total loss of customer trust  in that scenario  the question is when – rather than if – you get breached only with the best tools and team members sticking to cybersecurity best practices  and being capable of spotting phishing attacks  will you be able to defend your communication

it relates to the elections  foreign fake news seeks to  undermine democracies americans have proven we don t need russian or chinese trolls to push election related fake news on social networks — we are very adept at doing this all on our own  thank you  but on friday the us  uk and canadian governments pledged to combat foreign  information manipulation  that aims to  undermine our democracies and human rights globally  there s not a lot of specifics in the joint statement  but the effort does include all three countries endorsing the framework to counter foreign state information manipulation  which includes building interoperable digital tools to detect and mitigate these threats  the time is now for a collective approach to the foreign information manipulation threat that builds a coalition of like minded countries committed to strengthening resilience and response to information manipulation   the allies  statement says  we can do this through coordinated  whole of

also need to worry about how completed ballots are returned to state and county offices  and whether or not they have proper training and equipment in case miscreants mail toxic substances to their facilities paper ballots preferredbecause some voters can t cast their ballots in person or by postal mail  many states in the us offer email  fax  or web based apps to facilitate remote voting  this involves providing a blank digital ballot to citizens  allowing those voters to mark their choices via a web portal or other electronic interface  and then electronically sending the marked ballots

319,the european union  eu  has voted on tuesday  november 14  to pass the new consumer protection cooperation regulation  a new eu wide applicable law that gives extra power to national consumer protection agencies  but which also contains a vaguely worded clause that also grants them the power to block and take down websites without judicial oversight the new law  establishes overreaching internet blocking measures that are neither proportionate nor suitable for the goal of protecting consumers and come without mandatory judicial oversight   member of the european parliament julia reda said in a speech in the european parliament plenary during a last ditch effort to amend the law  video below   according to the new rules  national consumer protection authorities can order any unspecified third party to block access to websites without requiring judicial authorization   reda added later in the day on her blog this new law is an eu regulation and not a directive  meaning its obligatory for all eu states  which do not have to individually adopt it new cpc waters down consumer protections   work on the new consumer protection cooperation  cpc  regulation started back in 2016  and the process was set in motion to provide better consumer protection measures for eu consumers and a simpler intra state cooperation mechanism that could be used to track and take down infringing traders the cpc set out in motion with good intentions  but sometimes in the spring of 2017  the proposed regulation received a series of amendments that watered down some consumer protections but kept intact the provisions that ensured national consumer protection agencies can go after and block or take down websites for example  the new cpc has removed the ability of national consumer protection agencies to force  mandatory consumer compensation  from abusive traders  leaving this as voluntary and at  the trader s initiative  further  the new cpc does not allow national consumer protection agencies to force abusive traders to restitute illicit profits obtained by infringements on consumer protection laws    but keeps website blocking measure in placeinstead  the new cpc gives national consumer protection agencies the legal power to inquire and obtain information about domain owners from registrars and internet service providers they also have the power to block websites they believe to be infringing on consumer rights  and even take over their domains national protection agencies that up until now have been the organizations looking for sour milk in market chains and defective electronics will gain the power to order isps to block access to websites all over the eu  for such measures  these organizations will need to coordinate with local isps and create a country wide internet blocking infrastructure  even in countries were such intrusive practices have not been seen in theory  regulation should be used to go after online scam shopscpc factsheets and guidance documents claim this new legal frame could only be used for websites that sell scam products or break eu wide consumer protection laws  such as e commerce stores or travel booking sites that do not refund users  use fake product images  sell inexistent products  and so on consumer protection laws are always needed to protect customers against cases like infurn com  a website that peddled modern furniture but never delivered and hid the identity of its owners via data protection laws that prevented the domain registrar from revealing who was behind the scheme but as mep reda points out  without any mandatory judicial oversight  this new regulation could be abused  similarly to how much regulation passed to deal with one topic is often hijacked and applied in other areas as many users have already pointed out on social media  the new cpc is the perfect regulation riaa  mpaa  and other copyright enforcement agencies have been waiting to combat illegal torrenting portals  technically  movie or music studios put out  products   while torrent portals provide  scam  or  fake  versions of the same items  falling under the cpc s umbrella but while piracy has its good and bad sides  most should be afraid when this regulation is twisted by some member states to block access to non e commerce sites besides the website blocking clause  authorities will also be able to request information from banks to detect the identity of the responsible trader  to freeze assets  and to carry out mystery shopping to check geographical discrimination or after sales conditions overall  the new cpc addresses the changing landscape of modern commerce  but privacy advocates argue that blocking and taking down websites should only be done with judicial oversight  not left to the whims of unqualified consumer protection agents commentsgt500   6 years agoisn t government wonderful   poccasional   6 years agoyou re right  governments have no business blocking access

322,cybersecurity in depth  feature articles on security strategy  latest trends  and people to know if the proposed rule is approved  organizations would need to disclose all data breaches  even ones that don t cause any harm  to affected customers march 10  2023a proposed rule change at the federal communications commission  fcc  would expand the definition of a data breach for communications carriers  if approved by the agency  the rule would cover any incident that affects the confidentiality of customer information  even if no harm to customers results  this  rule  means  communications  carriers would be required to report any unauthorized access or disclosure of customer information  even if the breach was unintentional or not malicious   says venkat gupta  data estate modernization portfolio leader at sogeti  part of the capgemini group   everyone should care because data breaches can occur in many different ways  and even unintentional breaches can have profound consequences  according to the fcc  the rule change aligns with recent developments in federal and state data breach laws covering other industry sectors  the law requires carriers to protect sensitive consumer information  but given the increase in frequency  sophistication  and scale of data leaks  we must update our rules to protect consumers and strengthen reporting requirements   said fcc chairwoman jessica rosenworcel in a prepared statement   this new proceeding will take a much needed  fresh look at our data breach reporting rules to better protect consumers  increase security  and reduce the impact of future breaches  reporting to the fcc and consumersunder the current rule  gupta says  telecommunications carriers must notify federal law enforcement — the us secret service and the fbi — within seven business days of all breaches that involve customer proprietary network information  cpni   consumers are to be informed of such breaches seven days after carriers notify those agencies the proposed rule update requires carriers to notify the fcc contemporaneously with law enforcement agencies as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach  and it would eliminate the current seven day waiting period between notifying law enforcement and notifying consumers part of the incentive of updating the regulation is that if the fcc is going to make the definition of a breach broader  companies will reassess their cybersecurity policies and procedures to prevent the breaches in the first place  notes ali jessani  a senior associate at law firm wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr llp  wilmerhale  when a data breach occurs  such as an individual attack on a cell phone account  the attackers could monetize that attack in a matter of hours or minutes  such an attack  is exactly why the notification rule exists — to give the consumer the ability to limit potential damage to their personal information being compromised   jessani says however  he points out  while the carrier might report such breaches to the authorities right away  if law enforcement asks the carrier not to alert customers at the same time in order to preserve evidence for the investigation  the updated rule still protects the company the delay allows carriers to assess the scope and impact of the breach  including the number of customers affected and the type of information that was compromised  gupta adds  this information is important for determining the appropriate response to the breach and for assessing the potential harm to customers   he says   the waiting period also enables carriers to take any necessary steps to mitigate the effects of the breach and prevent further damage  having carriers notify the fcc  secret service  and fbi at the same time will minimize burdens on carriers  eliminate confusion regarding obligations  and streamline the reporting process  allowing carriers to free up resources that can be used to address the breach and prevent further harm  gupta says a push to improve processesthe proposed rule change could have a direct impact on carriers  operations as they are forced to change their processes and procedures  carriers will need to implement new procedures for identifying and reporting breaches that affect the confidentiality of customer information   gupta notes   this may include changes to the carrier s incident response plan  which outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a data breach  carriers might also need to invest in new technology or security measures to prevent breaches and detect unauthorized access to customer information  for example  some carriers might need to implement multifactor authentication  encryption  and other controls to protect sensitive customer data  overall the proposed rule change will require carriers to take a more proactive approach to data security and breach reporting   gupta says   this may result in additional costs and resources for carriers  but it is ultimately designed to better protect customer privacy and prevent future breaches in the telecommunications industry  public comments on the fcc data breach reporting requirements are due

to face the music on data privacy  eu legislators signed data privacy regulations into law in april  and the clock is ticking for implementation in 2018  before we entertain objections that the law places unreasonable demands on companies with eu citizens’ personal data  let’s remember that security and privacy are joined at the hip  you can’t ensure data privacy without adequate information security moving forward without proper security only slows the progress companies push for  consumers have lost faith in cybersecurity in digital commerce and online activity  according to a recent national telecommunications and information administration  ntia  survey  the general data protection regulation  gdpr  will hold companies accountable for security controls they should already have in place  new regulations are not only necessary  they’re overdue getting acquainted with the gdprorganizations essentially have two years to prepare to act as data borrowers  not owners  when a company collects customer data  it is on loan  the customer can monitor its use  decide who accesses it  and demand its return  a company must have the ability to audit and control each of these processes in order to comply with the new law  one can imagine how difficult this will be for global enterprises with thousands of vendors and partners  the sooner organizations can start  the better  the new law comes into effect on may 25  2018 it  security  and compliance practitioners must familiarize themselves with the requirements  ambitious readers can find the 200 page law available online  or an in depth guide  to get started  here are seven key provisions you should not ignore fines with teeth  in the past  regulators claim companies brushed fines off as mere  pocket money   individual countries defined their own fines  further exacerbating the challenge to the regulation’s impact  the new law will raise the maximum fine to four percent of global revenue or €20m  whichever is higher ringing the data breach alarm  we’ve grown accustomed to data breach notifications coming months after the fact – or even years  under the new law  companies will have 72 hours to report data loss to their regional authority  reducing the timeline from months to hours will force companies to put in place defined policies on responding to data breaches  if you thought having a breach response plan in place was a given  think again  only 44 5  of companies have a complete plan  according to a cloud security alliance survey regulations beyond borders  this provision should grab the attention of any global companies who were exempt from the previous regulation because they were not headquartered in the eu  now any organization with data on eu individuals must comply with the regulation  wherever they are based  experts have already predicted the law will encompass  pretty much every website and app in the world  know your partners  hackers have realized that the easiest path to a company’s sensitive data can be third party contractors  from an hvac vendor to a press release wire service  under the new law  any company who touches regulated data must comply with the law  even if they are not the data collector  for companies who do not have a full list of vendors and business partners  taking inventory and evaluating risk will be an essential undertaking no running from the law  companies can transfer data outside the eu  including to cloud providers with servers based in other countries  the company does not hand off responsibility and still remains liable for any lost data one law for one continent  up until now  enforcement on data privacy infractions has been inconsistent even among european countries  with certain countries taking tougher stances than others  the gdpr will standardize all countries under the same strict law  so there will be no surprises for companies based on the region of enforcement encryption as a saving grace  encryption is a powerful tool for reducing risk in the event of data loss  and the gdpr recognizes this capability  encrypting data exempts a company from its breach notification responsibility  rather than encrypt all customer data  companies should encrypt fields containing regulated data  doing so before data leaves the company network can also provide a method of reducing third party risk  especially from cloud providers companies collect more information on customers than ever as business moves online and data collection happens so seamlessly that companies can lose sight of the responsibility that comes with storing sensitive information  the gdpr codifies the belief that  the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental

325,in the us  california has traditionally dominated the privacy conversation  this is changing  now organizations doing business in virginia  colorado  utah  and connecticut all have new regulations to learn and comply with adding a new dimension to the cost of data breaches  the explosion of regulations taking effect in 2023 can inflict real costs on non compliant businesses  read on to learn about existing and upcoming legislation and how your can protect your business and users through simple but effective changes  such as stronger password policies 2023  the year of data privacy lawslegislation moves slowly  but in 2023 almost all five of the below regulations will take effect  making it a huge year for state data privacy acts  start implementing the necessary changes today and avoid problems down the road   california privacy rights act  cpra   amending the california consumer privacy act  ccpa  previously passed in 2018  was passed on january 1st  2023  and was supposed to take effect on july 1st  2023  in a last minute ruling  the superior court of california has delayed implementation until no earlier than march 29th  2024  the ccpa is still in full effect   virginia consumer data protection act  vcdpa   the second state privacy act  passed in march of 2021 and went into effect on january 1st of 2023   connecticut data privacy act  ctdpa   passing in may of 2022  this legislation went into effect only recently  on july 1st of 2023   colorado privacy act  cpa   similar to connecticut  it went into effect on july 1st  2023  but  only on january 1st  2024  does the requirement for a universal opt out mechanism go into effect   utah consumer privacy act  ucpa   brining up the rear  this finally goes into effect on december 31st of 2023  despite not being the last of the state privacy acts to pass  the ucpa implementation date is the last of them all what do the regulations expect of organizations all the laws focus on protecting consumer information collected and used by organizations  however  understanding the different privacy laws is hard for businesses in the above states  it’s even more difficult for multi state businesses each regulation offers the right to access  delete  and opt out of data collection and storage  almost all offer a right to correct existing information  except for the ucpa  most laws do not allow an opt out of sensitive data processing  with sensitive data definitions varying between states thankfully  all regulations generally offer a cure period of at least 30 days to correct mistakes the differences in the regulations are how they apply to different organizations  most apply to larger businesses or organizations that process large volumes of consumer data  check the below table to see which data privacy laws apply to your organization  california  ccpa   cpra  gross revenues of  25 million or more and process data of at least 100 000 consumers or derive at least 50  of gross revenue from sharing or selling data  virginia  vcdpa  this applies to businesses processing data of at least 100 000 consumers or 25 000 consumers and deriving at least 50  of gross revenues from sales  connecticut  ctdpa  businesses processing data of at least 25 000 consumers and services at least 50  of gross revenues from selling data or 100 000 consumers  excluding purely patent transactions  colorado  cpa  businesses processing data of at least 100 000 consumers or 25 000 consumers and derive revenue or receive a discount from selling personal data  utah  ucpa  those businesses with  25 million in annual gross revenue and process data of at least 100 000 consumers or process data of at least 25 000 consumers and derive at least 50  gross revenues from sales consequences of a breachbeyond the reputational damage  each privacy law has real monetary cost attached to failure  though not all are the same  the per violation penalties range from  5 000 in connecticut to  20 000 in colorado  most states have civil penalties of  7 500  with minor differences there are more than a few examples of recent compromises from phishing attempts  examples include the activision breach in late 2022  or the norton lifelock compromise in early january that used an employee’s previously compromised account to log in to norton customer accounts  resulting in data loss if your it systems are breached due to compromised user credentials and user data is stolen  the penalties can quickly add up  especially for larger companies spanning multiple states crafting a strong defense can mitigate a breach s reputational and real dollar costs  most attackers look for low hanging fruit such as easy to guess passwords  or previously leaked credentials naturally  businesses may ask how they can best protect their customers through compliance  themselves from fines  and their reputation from bad press  a proactive company focuses on keeping its data protected one of the best ways to protect themselves is through a strong password policy  multi factor authentication  and avoidance of compromised passwords password security protects your business and customerscompromised passwords can lead to potential infrastructure vulnerabilities and the loss of customer data  which may violate different state data protection regulations  depending on the circumstances  non compliance means potential liability and high costs across the different state data protection laws a two pronged approach to securing your organization s passwords goes a long way to avoiding security lapses first  audit the existing passwords used within your organization  specops password auditor is a free download that scans your active directory for password vulnerabilities  including over 940 million compromised passwords next  secure future password changes and comply with the latest legislation with a tool like specops password policy with breached password protection specops password policy extends the function of group policy  has an easy to use interface that helps organizations enforce a stronger password policy  meet compliance standards and blocks over 3 billion known compromised passwords by blocking compromised passwords  you can protect your organization from potential data breaches and extensive fines from the recently passed data privacy

326,the indian president droupadi murmu on friday granted assent to the digital personal data protection bill  dpdpb  after it was unanimously passed by both houses of the parliament last week  marking a significant step towards securing people s information  the bill provides for the processing of digital personal data in a manner that recognizes both the rights of the individuals to protect their personal data and the need to process such personal data for lawful purposes and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto   the indian government said the long awaited data protection law comes months after the ministry of electronics and information technology  meity  released a draft version of the bill in november 2022  it has been in the making for over five years  with a first draft released in july 2018  a year before  india s supreme court upheld privacy as a fundamental right the legislative framework  which applies to personal data collected both online and offline  and subsequently digitized  inside and outside of india  requires that information be processed  only for a lawful purpose upon consent of an individual  and only store what s necessary for the purpose defined the requests for explicit consent from users should be accompanied or preceded by a notice to inform the purpose for which the personal data is proposed to be processed   personal data  refers to  any data about an individual who is identifiable by or in relation to such data  consent  however  is not required for  certain legitimate uses  under which platforms can process personal user data when it is provided voluntarily  for example  by opting to send bills via email  it also waives compliance requirements for certain data fiduciaries  such as startups on top of that  processing any personal data of children aged up to 18 years or a person with disability who has a lawful guardian necessitates that companies obtain verifiable consent of their parents or guardians  the bill does not permit processing which is detrimental to well being of children or involves their tracking  behavioral monitoring  or targeted advertising   the government noted that said  the consent can be exempted upon examination of whether a covered entity sufficiently proves the processing of personal data of children is done in a manner that is deemed  verifiably safe  by the government entities in charge of the information are obligated to maintain the accuracy of data  keep data secure  and delete data once its purpose has been met  it also bestows users the right to obtain information  seek correction and erasure  and grievance redressal furthermore  the dpdp act stipulates the establishment of a data protection board  dpb  comprising members appointed by the government to examine complaints  investigate data breaches  and levy penalties based on the severity  duration  and the  repetitive nature  of the incidents  in case of a citizen s data breach  they simply need to visit the website  provide the data protection board with details  and the board will initiate an inquiry  imposing penalties on the breaching platforms   it minister rajeev chandrasekhar said organizations that misuse or fail to safeguard individuals  digital data or notify the dpb of a hack can face monetary fines of up to ₹250 crore   30 1 million   decisions of the board can be appealed to the telecom disputes settlement and appellate tribunal for review within 60 days in what s a relaxation from the earlier draft of the bill  companies that handle personal data can now transfer it to any other country for processing  unless the central government has explicitly prohibited such transfers  previously  cross border data transfers were only allowed to a specific set of countries and territories a major sticking point is the broad exemption granted to government agencies from adhering to the provisions of the act in the  interest of prevention  detection  investigation or prosecution of any offense or contravention of any law for the time being in force in india  the lack of autonomy of the dpb notwithstanding  much of the focus has centered around concerns that the exemptions could potentially result in data collection  processing  and retention beyond what is deemed necessary  thereby potentially facilitating increased mass surveillance and government led invasions of privacy another equally worrying matter is the ability of the government to restrict access to  any information generated  transmitted  received  stored or hosted  in any computer resource  in the interests of the general public  leading to  unbridled censorship of dissenting opinions   in its present form  the dpdpb  2023 does not sufficiently safeguard the right to privacy and must not be enacted   the internet freedom foundation said in a statement   it fails to address many data protection concerns and instead puts in place a regime to facilitate the data

329,the usa securities and exchange commission has adopted new rules requiring publicly traded companies to disclose cyberattacks within four business days after determining they re material incidents according to the wall street watchdog  material incidents are those that a public company s shareholders would consider important  in making an investment decision  the sec also adopted new regulations mandating foreign private issuers to provide equivalent disclosures following cybersecurity breaches  whether a company loses a factory in a fire — or millions of files in a cybersecurity incident — it may be material to investors  currently  many public companies provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors   said sec chair gary gensler today  i think companies and investors alike  however  would benefit if this disclosure were made in a more consistent  comparable  and decision useful way  through helping to ensure that companies disclose material cybersecurity information  today s rules will benefit investors  companies  and the markets connecting them  listed companies must now include details about the cyberattack  including the incident s nature  scope  and timing  in periodic report filings  specifically on 8 k forms these new cybersecurity incident reporting rules are set to take effect in december or 30 days after being published in the federal register however  smaller companies will be granted an additional 180 days before they are required to provide form 8 k disclosures in some instances  the disclosure timeline may also be postponed if the usa attorney general determines that an immediate disclosure would pose a significant risk to national security or public safety timely disclosures designed to increase transparencytoday s announcement follows plans to adopt these new rules revealed by the sec more than a year ago  in march 2022 the new rules  pdf  provide investors with prompt notifications about security incidents that impact listed companies  improving their understanding of cybersecurity risk management and strategy they require the disclosure of the following breach related information  provided it is available at the

altered  accessed  or used without authorization   the impact of the incident on the company s operations   information about ongoing or completed remediation efforts by the company however  affected companies are not expected to disclose technical specifics of their incident response plans or details about potential vulnerabilities that might influence their response or remediation actions according to lesley ritter  senior vice president for moody s investors service  the new rules will increase transparency but will likely prove challenging for smaller companies  the cybersecurity disclosure rules adopted by the usa securities and exchange commission earlier today will provide more transparency into an otherwise opaque but growing risk  as well as more consistency and predictability   ritter told bleepingcomputer  increased disclosure should help companies compare practices and may spur improvements in cyber defenses  but meeting the new disclosure standards could be a bigger challenge for smaller companies with limited resources  commentswright is   6 months agoseems like gdpr  but only if it affects investors  not actual people s data or systems    and a more

on treasury’s ffiec examinations  nist 800 53  which had an update to the third party risk guidance a few weeks ago  either way it’s a lot more disclosure than any company  outside of banks  are accustomed to they’ve done a great job with defining breach and it includes unauthorized access if audits are like soc 2’s i’m assuming logs may be examined  hopefully microsoft also provides the logs

332,breaking cybersecurity news  news analysis  commentary  and other content from around the world  with an initial focus on the middle east   africa as the law s october 2023 transition deadline approaches  it s critical for organizations doing business in rwanda to understand its requirements and implications september 11  2023data protection and privacy laws can enable legal safety for citizens  personal information  prevent unauthorized use of personal data  and establish accountability for organizations that handle sensitive information therefore  on oct  15  2021  the rwandan government enacted a personal data and privacy protection law  this law applies to individuals and established institutions within or outside rwanda that process the personal data of individuals living in rwanda  one of the law s primary goals is to grant individuals the authority to control their personal information  another goal is to support the reliable and protected movement of data within rwanda and across its borders some of the law s key provisions are article 48 bars data being transferred to third parties unless they are authorized by the national cyber security authority  ncsa  article 50 requires all personal data to be stored in rwanda except for registered entities with ncsa issued certificates to store data abroad article 17 mandates data controllers and processors to keep a record of personal data processing activities and submit the data to ncsa upon request article 38 3  requires controllers and processors to provide data protection impact assessments  dpias  when processing poses a high risk to individuals  rights article 43 mandates a data processor to inform the data controller of a data breach within 48 hours of discovery  it also requires a data controller to notify ncsa within 48 hours of becoming aware of a breach  the data controller must inform the subject of the data breach  unless the breach is communicated to the public article 9 requires a parent or guardian s consent before the personal data of a child under 16 can be processed  it also states that consent is acceptable only if it s in the child s interest  however  consent is not required if processing the data is important to the child s welfare article 8 grants data subjects the right to revoke consent at any time articles 29–31 require that anyone who intends to process data must register with the ncsa and be granted a data protection and privacy  dpp  certificate consequences of noncompliancethe rwandan government gave a two year transition period to allow individuals and organizations to align their data processing activities with the law  this transition period will end on oct  15  2023 if an individual or organization fails to register and comply with this law by the deadline  the ncsa is authorized to enforce the following sanctions individuals or organizations that operate without a dpp certificate  a fine between rwf 2 million  us 1 700  and rwf 5 million  us 4 250  or an amount equal to one percent of the entity s total revenue from the previous fiscal year individuals  organizations  data controllers  or data processors that operate without a dpp certificate may be fined between rwf 2 million  us 1 700  and rwf 5 million  us 4 250  or an amount equal to one percent of the entity s total revenue from the previous fiscal year data processors and controllers can also be fined if they operate with an expired dpp certificate impact on rwandans and africathis law makes rwanda the 35th african country to have a data policy law and the 30th to have a data protection authority to enforce it the law is expected to help boost consumer confidence in rwanda  when people trust that their data is handled responsibly  they are more likely to engage with online services and share their information  this drives economic growth and innovation in the country furthermore  stringent data privacy laws can facilitate international trade and data sharing  this is because countries with robust data protection laws are often deemed safe for cross border data transfers  a requirement in today s globalized economy above all  rwanda s appointment of a data protection authority  ncsa  to oversee and enforce its data privacy and protection law is projected to help reduce the frequency and impact of data breaches in the country  hopefully  this law also makes rwanda a positive example for other african nations to adopt similar regulations and enhance data protection within their borders read more about dr global middle east

333,the security and exchange commission s proposed rule for public companies  pprc  is ambiguous september 1  2023in march 2022  the securities and exchange commission  sec  proposed a rule on cybersecurity disclosure  governance  and risk management for public companies  known as the proposed rule for public companies  prpc   this rule would require companies to report  material  cybersecurity incidents within four days  it would also require that boards of directors have cybersecurity expertise unsurprisingly  it s being met with all sorts of pushback  in its current form  the proposed rule leaves a lot of room for interpretation  and it s impractical in some areas for one  the tight disclosure window will put massive amounts of pressure on chief information security officers  cisos  to disclose material incidents before they have all the details  incidents can take weeks and sometimes months to understand and fully remediate  it is impossible to know the impact of a new vulnerability until ample resources are dedicated to remediation  cisos may also end up having to disclose vulnerabilities that  with more time  end up being less of an issue and therefore not material  that  could in turn affect the short term price of a company incidents are a living thing — not a one and done dealfour day disclosure requirements might sound fine at face value  but they are not realistic and will ultimately distract cisos from putting out fires i ll use the european union s general data protection regulation  gdpr  as a comparison  under the regulation  companies must report incidents of non compliance within 72 hours  however  in the case of gdpr  the need to report is well defined  while 72 hours is often too soon to know the specifics of an incident s overall impact  organizations at the very least will know if personal information has been compromised compare this with the prpc s proposed disclosure requirements  organizations will have an extra 24 hours  but — based on what s been publicized thus far — they must qualify internally if the breach is material  under gdpr  a company can do that based on the sensitivity of the data  its volume  and where it went  under prpc   materiality  is defined by the sec as anything that a  reasonable shareholder would consider important   this could be virtually anything shareholders consider material to their business  it s rather broad and not clearly defined other weak definitionsanother issue is the proposal s requirement to disclose circumstances in which a security incident was not material on its own but has become so  in aggregate   how does this work in practice  is an unpatched vulnerability from six months ago now in scope for disclosure  given that the company didn t patch it  if it s used to extend the scope of a subsequent incident  we already conflate threats  vulnerabilities  and business impact  a vulnerability that isn t exploited isn t material because it doesn t create a business impact  what will you need to disclose when aggregate incidents need to be reported  and does the aggregation clause make this even harder to discern to make this more complicated  the proposed rule will require organizations to disclose any policy changes that resulted from previous incidents  how rigorously will this be measured and  honestly  why do it  policies are supposed to be statements of intent — they re not supposed to be low level  forensic configuration guides  updating a lower level document  a standard  to mandate a specific encryption algorithm for sensitive data makes sense  but there are few higher level docs that would be updated due to an incident  examples might be requiring multifactor authentication or changing the patching service level agreement  sla  for in scope critical vulnerabilities lastly  the proposal says quarterly earnings reports will be the forum for disclosures  personally  quarterly earnings calls don’t seem like the right forum to go deep on policy updates and security incidents  who will give the updates  the cfo or ceo  who typically provides earnings reports  might not be sufficiently informed to give those critical reports  so  does the ciso now join the calls  and  if so  will they also respond to questions from financial analysts  it all seems impractical  but we ll have to wait and see questions about board experiencethe first iteration of prpc required disclosures about board oversight of cybersecurity risk management policies  this included disclosures about the individual board members and their respective cyber expertise  the sec says it purposefully kept the definition broad  given the range in skill and experience particular to each board luckily  after much scrutiny  they decided to remove this requirement  prpc does still call for companies to describe the board’s process for overseeing cybersecurity risks  and management’s role in handling those risks this will require some adjustments in communication and general awareness  recently  dr  keri pearlson  executive director of cybersecurity at mit sloan  and lucia milică  ciso at stanley black   decker  surveyed 600 board members about activities surrounding cybersecurity  they found that  fewer than half  47   of members serve on boards that interact with their cisos regularly  and almost a third of them only see their cisos at board presentations   this clearly points to a communications gap the good news is most boards already have an audit and risk committee  which can serve as a subset of the board for this purpose  that said  it s not uncommon for cisos and csos to present matters involving cybersecurity that the rest of the board doesn t fully understand  to close this gap  there needs to be greater alignment between the board and security executives uncertainty prevailsas with any new regulation  there are questions and uncertainties with prpc  we ll just have to wait and see how it all evolves and whether companies can meet the proposed requirements about the author s you may also like,regulatory changes and compliance,emerging threats and attack techniques,"{'vulnerability

337,cybersecurity in depth  feature articles on security strategy  latest trends  and people to know companies with customers in california need to prepare for a new process for demanding deletion of personal data october 12  2023now that california gov  gavin newsom has signed a bill defining the legal obligations of data brokers into law  businesses that serve people in the golden state will have to meet a new set of processes to safeguard consumers  personal privacy  the new law consolidates california specific processes under a state agency established by prior privacy legislation the california delete act  formally called  data broker registration  accessible deletion mechanism   sb362   updates the state civil code to add and modify sections that pertain to data brokers to clarify such entities  responsibilities and processes  the new law also moves enforcement of data broker obligations from the california district attorney s office to the california privacy protection agency the california privacy protection agency is tasked with maintaining a website that informs consumers of their rights and how to exercise them  as well as establishing a mechanism by jan  1  2026  that allows consumers to request any and all data brokers to delete their personal data  the data brokers will have to start accessing the agency s mechanism and process all consumer deletion requests at least every 45 days as of aug  1  2026  once the broker has deleted a consumer s data  it further has to delete any personal information it has regarding that consumer during that same 45 day period  the delete act also requires data brokers to  register with  pay a registration fee to  and provide information to  the california privacy protection agency starting july 1  2027 business concernsthe new law defines a data broker as  a business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship   the california privacy rights act of 2020 s definition of  business  — a company that meets at least one of these conditions  gross annual revenues of more than  25 million  collects personal information of at least 50 000 people  households  or devices  and or makes at least half its annual revenue from selling consumer data — still stands data brokers will have to register with the california privacy protection agency  providing information such as business contact information  data deletion links  audit reports  and whether the company collects information about minors  geolocation data  or reproductive health care — a hot button issue for consumer rights advocates since the striking down of federal abortion rights protections neither the ccpa  the cpra  nor the delete act defines  direct relationship  with consumers  however  as industry group international association of privacy professionals  iapp  pointed out in its coverage of the new law  another concern data brokers have  according to the iapp  includes a provision that doubles fines for brokers that fail to register with the california privacy protection agency to  200 a day  meanwhile  the consumer data industry association asserted that deleting consumer data will open the door to fraud joey stanford  vice president of data privacy and compliance at platform sh  said in a statement that the act will close some loopholes  which will benefit consumers  regulation comes with implementation costs for businesses and usually a negative hit to the bottom line of companies that are affected  which can cause pushback from corporations   he added fodder for wider regulationinterestingly  the delete act was signed into law just two days before the uk us data bridge takes effect on oct  12  that agreement sets out conditions for transferring personal data between the us and the uk  a similar agreement already exists between the us and the european union  but because the uk left the eu as of 2020  after the 2016 brexit referendum  a separate agreement was required  now that britain is out of the eu  it has privacy laws separate from europe s stringent gdpr — as do many other countries  presenting compliance complexity  but the us has yet to create a truly unified piece of federal privacy regulation  federal data privacy legislation seems like a natural progression  once lawmakers can agree on the right balance  as we see more attempts at regulating data privacy at the state level  perhaps with the right combination of ccpa cpra delete act rolled up together  it could be a blueprint for a federal law  although there would be no effect on data brokers in other geographies  e g  india   creating nationwide policy for the us would help tremendously   stanford said

338,cybersecurity in depth  getting answers to questions about it security threats and best practices from trusted cybersecurity professionals and industry experts as stringent new sec reporting rules take effect  cisos need to assess internal processes and understand their responsibilities  but there s a bright side december 18  2023question  how can cisos keep up with changing cybersecurity regulations ilona cohen  chief legal and policy officer  hackerone  it is never an easy time to be a chief information security officer  ciso   but the past few months have felt particularly challenging  to the usual stressors of the job — such as the ongoing increase in ransomware attacks and the pervasiveness of insider threats — we can now add heightened regulatory enforcement scrutiny the recent charges from the us security and exchange commission  sec  against solarwinds  ciso is the first time a ciso has been singled out in this way by the agency  this suggests a larger trend of increased accountability for individuals in charge of managing organizational security programs in addition  companies traded on us exchanges must comply with the sec s new cybersecurity disclosure and incident reporting rules starting now  and qualifying smaller companies must comply with the incident reporting rules in spring 2024  these changes put organizational security programs under even greater scrutiny and add to the load of responsibilities cisos must track it s no surprise that many cisos are feeling more pressure than ever these new rules and liabilities do not necessarily need to be a hindrance to a ciso s work — in fact  they can actually be a source of support for cisos  sec rules around cybersecurity disclosures and incidents have historically been somewhat hard to discern  by clarifying requirements for disclosing security risk management programs  governance  and cyber incidents  the sec is providing cisos with a guidebook in addition  the sec s increased expectations for risk management and governance may give cisos greater standing to demand internal resources and processes to meet those expectations  new requirements for publicly traded companies to disclose risk management practices to investors create additional incentives to strengthen proactive cybersecurity defenses  even before they went into effect  the sec s new rules have heightened awareness of cybersecurity practices among company boards and non ciso company leadership  which will likely translate to more expansive cybersecurity resourcing public companies with robust security programs that include continuously identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities may be more attractive to investors from risk management  security maturity  and corporate governance perspectives  at the same time  companies that take a proactive stance to reducing security risk — for example  implementing and appropriately resourcing cybersecurity best practices like those contained in isos 27001  29147  and 30111 — are less likely to suffer material cyberattacks that damage the company s brand this new regulatory landscape represents an opportunity for cisos to take stock of their internal reporting procedures and make sure they re up to par  if publicly traded companies do not already have procedures to escalate significant security issues to executive management  these processes should be established immediately  cisos should help prepare disclosures about company risk management processes  they should also help ensure the company s public statements about security are accurate  fulsome  and not misleading under the new sec rule  public companies must disclose within four business days any cybersecurity incident deemed  material   but many incident responders are wondering what it means to be  material   especially when the sec declined to adopt a cybersecurity related definition of  materiality  in the rule and kept the standard familiar to investors and public companies  an incident is  material  if information about that incident is something a reasonable shareholder would have relied on to make informed investment decisions or when it would have significantly altered the  total mix  of information available to the shareholder practically speaking  determining what is and isn t material is not always obvious  while an incident responder may be used to assessing the security implications of an incident  such as how many records were impacted  how many unauthorized users had access  or what type of information was at risk  they may be less accustomed to thinking about the broader implications for the company  that s why many companies are putting protocols in place — such as referral to an internal committee made up of security professionals  lawyers  and members of the c suite — to assess not just the security risk caused by an incident  but the impact to the company overall  an interdisciplinary team is more likely to be able to assess whether the incident exposes a company to liability  affects the company s financial position  disturbs the relationship between the company and its customers  or affects the company s operations due to unauthorized access or disruption in service  all of which are relevant to the materiality determination with some conscientious adjustments to standard operating procedures  cisos can adapt effectively to this new regulatory climate without drastically increasing workloads or compounding already high levels of stress about the author s you may also likeenterprises worry end

339,february 6  2024attackers used sql injection and cross site scripting  xss  to target at least 65 job recruitment and retail websites with legitimate penetration testing tools  stealing databases containing more than 2 million emails and other personal records of job seekers in just a month s time dubbed  resumelooters  by researchers in group ib s threat intelligence unit — who discovered the campaign — the group targeted mainly victims in india  taiwan  thailand  vietnam  china  and australia  stealing emails and other data containing personal information from people s resumes  researchers revealed in a blog post on feb  6  the data included names  phone numbers  and dates of birth  as well as information about job seekers’ experience and employment history all told  the group — believed to be operating since the beginning of 2023 — stole several databases containing 2 079 027 unique emails and other records in attacks that occurred between last november and december  the researchers found  while more than 70  of victims were in the asia pacific  apac  region  group ib also identified compromised companies in other regions  including brazil  italy  mexico  russia  turkey  and the us specifically  attackers targeted 26 retail companies and 19 job seeking sites  as well as a handful of organizations in professional services  delivery  real estate  investment  and other industries  the group then put the stolen data up for sale on chinese speaking telegram channels cyberattacks using pen testing toolsresumelooters  attack vector is similar to that of another group called gambleforce  which group ib discovered targeting apac region in september  like that group  attackers used a variety of publicly available penetration testing tools to target and inject malicious script into websites  in the case of resumelooters  common tools included acunetix  beef framework  x ray  metasploit  arl  asset reconnaissance lighthouse   and dirsearch  resumelooters is yet another example of how much damage can be made with just a handful of publicly available tools   senior threat analyst nikita rostovcev from group ib s advanced persistent threat  apt  research team wrote in the post   both gambleforce and resumelooters employ very straightforward attack methods  the team s investigation began with the identification of a malicious server at 139 180 137   107  on which they found logs of several penetration testing tools  including sqlmap  that revealed the attackers were targeting employment websites and retail companies the most common initial vector used by resumelooters is sql injection via sqlmap  but in some cases attackers injected xss scripts into legitimate job search sites to carry out attacks  the researchers found  the attack occurs when the injection triggers the execution of a malicious remote script that displays a phishing form to steal visiting job seekers  data in one of its xss attacks  resumelooters even created a fake employer profile on a legitimate recruitment website  injecting malicious xss script into one of the fields in the profile  the profile also included a link to admin cloudnetsafe   com  which the researchers believe could be another domain associated with the group  though it was inaccessible at the time the researchers analyzed it evidence also suggested that resumelooters attempted to gain shell access on target systems to download and execute additional payloads  and try to find more data  while having full control of the victims  server  however  it s unclear if these attempts were successful  rostovcev said group ib has notified the victims of the companies targeted in the attacks  so they could take all necessary steps to mitigate further damage   he added job seekers in the cyber crosshairsthreat actors often target job seekers through various employment scams  due to the range of information that can be gleaned through communications with them  as well as the opportunity to sway them using social engineering indeed  threat groups from north korea in particular are adept at targeting job seekers worldwide using fake job offers aimed at stealing their personal info and credentials  attackers also exploit social media platforms  such as facebook  to target those seeking employment  especially for remote work attacks like the ones by resumelooters and gambleforce are  easily avoidable   yet company websites can be compromised due to  poor security as well as inadequate database and website management practices   rostovcev noted the campaign is a reminder to organizations that they must prioritize cybersecurity and stay vigilant against evolving threats  he said  to do this  group ib made several recommendations for organizations to prevent both sql injection and xss attacks for the former  organizations should use parameterized statements or prepared statements provided by their particular programming language or framework when linking together user input directly into sql queries   this helps to separate user input from sql code   rostovcev wrote implementing a web application firewall can detect and block sql injection attempts  providing an additional layer of defense against various web application attacks  another tactic that can help prevent both sql injection and xss attacks is to validate and sanitize user inputs on both the client and server sides  ensuring that inputs adhere to expected formats and length constraints  according to group ib to prevent xss attacks  the researchers suggested  organizations also can escape special characters to ensure that they are treated as literal text and not interpreted as code before rendering user generated content about the author s you may also like,data breaches and

340,saas applications are the darlings of the software world  they enable work from anywhere  facilitate collaboration  and offer a cost effective alternative to owning the software outright  at the same time  the very features that make saas apps so embraced – access from anywhere and collaboration – can also be exploited by threat actors recently  adaptive shield commissioned a total economic impact™  tei  study conducted by forrester consulting  the study demonstrates the impactful roi achieved by a multimedia company with an annual revenue of  10 billion  while the quantitative roi is significant  at 201   the qualitative security roi improvements were substantial  figure 1  summary of the tei studyin this article  we ll examine the study s findings of how adaptive shield s saas security posture management  sspm  platform impacted this global enterprise the organization s top saas challengesin interviews with forrester consulting  the organization being studied pointed out several key challenges that were facing in their saas stack leading up to 2022   the organization acknowledged that they lacked the knowledge and skill to manage the applications  they didn t understand many of the unique configurations or the impact they had on security or compliance  which left them unaware of the risks or mitigations that needed to happen   the organization had experienced an increase in saas adoption across it  hr  sales  marketing  and other departments  they recognized that sensitive assets and valuable data were moving into saas applications and being spread out in a way that the security team could no longer supervise all its comings and goings  in addition  they needed to foster collaboration between the app owners  who control the applications  and security teams that are tasked with securing them   they were also dealing with increased complexity caused by their merger   acquisition  m a  activity  each m a increased the number of applications that they needed to manage  many of which were geographically distributed tenants that could not be easily combined with existing tenants of the app the organization began looking for a solution that could alleviate the saas misconfigurations that they were dealing with at scale  they needed a platform that would integrate with multiple business applications  mitigate communication issues between the app owners and security teams  and help them maintain regulatory compliance in their saas stack they were impressed with adaptive shield s platform which not only demonstrated the widest coverage of supported applications but also found configuration issues during the proof of concept phase  in 2022  adaptive shield was selected and deployed to secure the organization s stack security benefits adaptive shield introduced to the organizationforrester consulting found that adaptive shield enabled the security team to  gain complete control and increased visibility of the security posture of all business critical applications  increased saas security posturethe security team had dealt with six security issues stemming from misconfigurations and low security posture in the past  however  the organization saw posture improvements beginning with the poc  they  realized substantial improvement in its security posture score through visibility  remediation guidance  and ongoing monitoring  while experiencing a 30  increase in posture improved collaborationforrester consulting also found evidence of increased collaboration between security teams and app owners  they noted that business owners are critical players in securing applications  as they have  the key to the kingdom   but they lacked the security expertise needed to secure their ecosystem  deploying adaptive shield helped bridge that gap and foster collaboration between the app owners and security teams many other security benefitswhile some security benefits were quantifiable by the forrester consulting team  they were unable to place a dollar value on everything offered by adaptive shield  for example  forrester consulting found that the automated processes within the adaptive shield platform allowed security teams to focus on security management rather than conduct interviews with app owners about their configurations  it also helped the organization overcome challenges introduced by the democratization of saas security  it helped the organization achieve continuous compliance  avoiding any interruptions to business operations  and staying ahead of any saas security trends why economic benefits indicated a 201  roithe total economic impact™ study measured the return on investment experienced by the organization that was interviewed  to quantify these findings  forrester consulting first calculated the value of an improved saas security posture  they factored in the number of breaches that had taken place before adaptive shield was deployed and projected the number of breaches over three years  their calculations included diminished productivity  impacted business and security users  and salary data  their three year present value estimate of an improved saas security posture was  1 49m  figure 2  breakdown of roi by categorynext  forrester consulting reviewed operational efficiency achieved through the adaptive shield s sspm platform  they factored in the number of applications being monitored  hourly wages  and the cost of securing saas applications with and without an automated solution  their estimated three year present value of savings was  397k forrester consulting then turned its attention to compliance  they calculated improvements in efficiency based on the time it takes organizations to review their applications and ensure compliance with the different standards  their three year present value was worth  260k improved collaboration between security teams and business app owners added another 32k in savings over three years at present value  while the study noted other areas of roi  it wasn t able to quantify them the total benefits over three years  at present value  totaled  2 18m  the total licensing and

due to cross border integration  asd’s acsc and ncsc nz assess australian and new zealand critical infrastructure  respectively  could be vulnerable to similar activity from prc state sponsored actors as the authoring agencies have previously highlighted  the use of living off the land  lotl  techniques is a hallmark of volt typhoon actors’ malicious cyber activity when targeting critical infrastructure  the group also relies on valid accounts and leverage strong operational security  which combined  allows for long term undiscovered persistence  in fact  the usa authoring agencies have recently observed indications of volt typhoon actors maintaining access and footholds within some victim it environments for at least five years  volt typhoon actors conduct extensive pre

joint advisory people’s republic of china state sponsored cyber actor living off the land to evade detection   since then  cisa  nsa  and fbi have determined that this activity is part of a broader campaign in which volt typhoon actors have successfully infiltrated the networks of critical infrastructure organizations in the continental and non continental united states and its territories  including guam the usa authoring agencies have primarily observed compromises linked to volt typhoon in communications  energy  transportation systems  and water and wastewater systems sector organizations’ it networks  some victims are smaller organizations with limited cybersecurity capabilities that provide critical services to larger organizations or key geographic locations volt typhoon actors tailor their ttps to the victim environment  however  the usa authoring agencies have observed the actors typically following the same pattern of behavior across identified intrusions  their choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations  and the usa authoring agencies assess with high confidence that volt typhoon actors are pre positioning themselves on it networks to enable the disruption of ot functions across multiple critical infrastructure sectors  see figure 1    volt typhoon conducts extensive pre compromise reconnaissance to learn about the target organization’s network architecture and operational protocols  this reconnaissance includes identifying network topologies  security measures  typical user behaviors  and key network and it staff  the intelligence gathered by volt typhoon actors is likely leveraged to enhance their operational security  for example  in some instances  volt typhoon actors may have abstained from using compromised credentials outside of normal working hours to avoid triggering security alerts on abnormal account activities   volt typhoon typically gains initial access to the it network by exploiting known or zero day vulnerabilities in public facing network appliances  e g   routers  virtual private networks  vpns   and firewalls  and then connects to the victim’s network via vpn for follow on activities   volt typhoon aims to obtain administrator credentials within the network  often by exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the operating system or network services  in some cases  volt typhoon has obtained credentials insecurely stored on a public facing network appliance   volt typhoon uses valid administrator credentials to move laterally to the domain controller  dc  and other devices via remote access services such as remote desktop protocol  rdp    volt typhoon conducts discovery in the victim’s network  leveraging lotl binaries for stealth  a key tactic includes using powershell to perform targeted queries on windows event logs  focusing on specific users and periods  these queries facilitate the discreet extraction of security event logs into datfiles  allowing volt typhoon actors to gather critical information while minimizing detection  this strategy  blending in depth pre compromise reconnaissance with meticulous post exploitation intelligence collection  underscores their sophisticated and strategic approach to cyber operations   volt typhoon achieves full domain compromise by extracting the active directory database  ntds dit  from the dc  volt typhoon frequently employs the volume shadow copy service  vss  using command line utilities such asvssadminto accessntds dit  thentds ditfile is a centralized repository that contains critical active directory data  including user accounts  passwords  in hashed form   and other sensitive data  which can be leveraged for further exploitation  this method entails the creation of a shadow copy—a point in time snapshot—of the volume hosting thentds ditfile  by leveraging this snapshot  volt typhoon actors effectively bypass the file locking mechanisms inherent in a live windows environment  which typically prevent direct access to thentds ditfile while the domain controller is operational   volt typhoon likely uses offline password cracking techniques to decipher these hashes  this process involves extracting the hashes from thentds ditfile and then applying various password cracking methods  such as brute force attacks  dictionary attacks  or more sophisticated techniques like rainbow tables to uncover the plaintext passwords  the successful decryption of these passwords allows volt typhoon actors to obtain elevated access and further infiltrate and manipulate the network   volt typhoon uses elevated credentials for strategic network infiltration and additional discovery  often focusing on gaining capabilities to access ot assets  volt typhoon actors have been observed testing access to domain joint ot assets using default ot vendor credentials  and in certain instances  they have possessed the capability to access ot systems whose credentials were compromised viantds dittheft  this access enables potential disruptions  such as manipulating heating  ventilation  and air conditioning  hvac  systems in server rooms or disrupting critical energy and water controls  leading to significant infrastructure failures  in some cases  volt typhoon actors had the capability to access camera surveillance systems at critical infrastructure facilities   in one confirmed compromise  volt typhoon actors moved laterally to a control system and were positioned to move to a second control system after successfully gaining access to legitimate accounts  volt typhoon actors exhibit minimal activity within the compromised environment  except discovery as noted above   suggesting their objective is to maintain persistence rather than immediate exploitation  this assessment is supported by observed patterns where volt typhoon methodically re targets the same organizations over extended periods  often spanning several years  to continuously validate and potentially enhance their unauthorized accesses  evidence of their meticulous approach is seen in instances where they repeatedly exfiltrate domain credentials  ensuring access to current and valid accounts  for example  in one compromise  volt typhoon likely extractedntds dit from three domain controllers in a four year period  in another compromise  volt typhoon actors extractedntds dit two times from a victim in a nine month period industry reporting—identifying that volt typhoon actors are silent on the network following credential dumping and perform discovery to learn about the environment  but do not exfiltrate data—is consistent with the usa authoring agencies’ observations  this indicates their aim is to achieve and maintain persistence on the network  in one confirmed compromise  an industry partner observed volt typhoon actors dumping credentials at regular intervals in addition to leveraging stolen account credentials  the actors use lotl techniques and avoid leaving malware artifacts on systems that would cause alerts  their strong focus on stealth and operational security allows them to maintain long term  undiscovered persistence  further  volt typhoon’s operational security is enhanced by targeted log deletion to conceal their actions within the compromised environment see the below sections for volt typhoon ttps observed by the usa authoring agencies from multiple confirmed volt typhoon compromises observed ttpsreconnaissancevolt typhoon

typically shift to establishing persistent access  ta0003   they often use vpn sessions to securely connect to victim environments  t1133   enabling discreet follow on intrusion activities  this tactic not only provides a stable foothold in the network but also allows them to blend in with regular traffic  significantly reducing their chances of detection executionvolt typhoon actors rarely use malware for post compromise execution  instead  once volt typhoon actors gain access to target environments  they use hands on keyboard activity via the command line  t1059  and other native tools and processes on systems  t1218   often referred to as “lolbins”   known as lotl  to maintain and expand access to the victim networks  according to industry reporting  some “commands appear to be exploratory or experimental  as the operators  i e   malicious actors  adjust and repeat them multiple times ” 2 for more details on lotl activity  see the credential access and discovery sections and appendix a  volt typhoon lotl activity similar to lotl  volt typhoon actors also use legitimate but outdated versions of network admin tools  for example  in one confirmed compromise  actors downloaded  t1105  an outdated version ofcomsvcs dll on the dc in a non standard folder comsvcs dll is a legitimate microsoft dynamic link library  dll  file normally found in thesystem32 folder  the actors used this dll withminidump and the process id of the local security authority subsystem service  lsass  to dump the lsass process memory  t1003 001  and obtain credentials  lsass process memory space contains hashes for the current user’s operating system  os  credentials  the actors also use legitimate non native network admin and forensic tools  for example  volt typhoon actors have been observed using magnet ram capture  mrc  version 1 20 on domain controllers  mrc is a free imaging tool that captures the physical memory of a computer  and volt typhoon actors likely used it to analyze in memory data for sensitive information  such as credentials  and in transit data not typically accessible on disk  volt typhoon actors have also been observed implanting fast reverse proxy  frp  for command and control  3   see the command and control section  persistencevolt typhoon primarily relies on valid credentials for persistence  t1078  defense evasionvolt typhoon has strong operational security  their actors primarily use lotl for defense evasion  ta0005   which allows them to camouflage their malicious activity with typical system and network behavior  potentially circumventing simplistic endpoint security capabilities  for more information  see joint guide identifying and mitigating living off the land techniques volt typhoon actors also obfuscate their malware  in one confirmed compromise  volt typhoon obfuscated frp client files  brightmetricagent exe andsmsvcservice exe  and the command line port scanning utility scanline by packing the files with

t1070 009  of their intrusion activity and masquerading file names  t1036 005  credential accessvolt typhoon actors first obtain credentials from public facing appliances after gaining initial access by exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities  t1068  in the operating system or network services  in some cases  they have obtained credentials insecurely stored on the appliance  t1552   in one instance  where volt typhoon likely exploited cve 2022 42475 in an unpatched fortinet device  volt typhoon actors compromised a domain admin account stored inappropriately on the device volt typhoon

tools  lotl utilities  and appliances already present on the system for system information  t1082   network service  t1046   group  t1069  and user  t1033  discovery volt typhoon uses at least the following lotl tools and commands for system information  network service  group  and user discovery techniques    some observed specific examples of discovery include   capturing successful logon events  t1654    specifically  in one incident  analysis of the powershell console history of a domain controller indicated that security event logs were directed to a file nameduser dat  as evidenced by the executed commandget eventlog security  instanceid 4624  after  year month date    fl     out file  c  users public documents user dat   this indicates the group s specific interest in capturing

of a separate file systeminfo dat  which was created inc  users public documentsbut subsequently deleted  t1070 004   the presence of these activities suggests a methodical approach by volt typhoon actors in collecting and then possibly removing traces of sensitive log information from the compromised system   specifically  in one incident  analysis of the powershell console history of a domain

t1007  see appendix a for additional lotl examples in one confirmed compromise  volt typhoon actors attempted to use advanced ip scanner  which was on the network for admin use  to scan the network volt typhoon actors have been observed strategically targeting network administrator web browser data—focusing on both browsing history and stored credentials  t1555 003 —to facilitate targeting of personal email addresses  see the reconnaissance section  for further discovery and possible network modifications that may impact the threat actor’s persistence within victim networks in one confirmed compromise   volt typhoon actors obtained the history file from theuser datadirectory of a network administrator user’s chrome browser  to obtain the history file  volt typhoon actors first executed an rdp session to the user’s workstation where they initially attempted  and failed  to obtain thec  file name  users  redacted  appdata local google chrome userdata default historyfile  as evidenced by the accompanying1016 reopen failed  smb error listed in the application event log  the threat actors then disconnected the rdp session to the workstation and accessed the filec  users  redacted  downloads history zip  this file presumably contained data from the user data directory of the user’s chrome browser  which the actors likely saved in the downloads directory for exfiltration  t1074   shortly after accessing thehistory zipfile  the actors terminated rdp sessions   about four months later  volt typhoon actors accessed the same user’s chrome datac  file name

advanced encryption standard  aes  encryption key  t1552 004  used to encrypt the passwords stored in the chrome browser  which would enable the actors to obtain plaintext passwords stored in the login data file in the chrome browser in another confirmed compromise  volt typhoon actors accessed directories containing chrome and edge user data on multiple systems  directory interaction was observed over the network to paths such asc  users  redacted  appdata local google chrome user data  andc  users  redacted  appdata local microsoft edge user data   they also enumerated several directories  including directories containing vulnerability testing and cyber related content and facilities data  such as construction drawings  t1083  lateral movementfor lateral movement  volt typhoon actors have been observed predominantly employing rdp with compromised valid administrator credentials  note  with a full on premises microsoft active directory identity compromise  see the credential access section   the group may be capable of using other methods such as pass the hash or pass the ticket for lateral movement  t1550  in one confirmed compromise of a water and wastewater systems sector entity  after obtaining initial access  volt typhoon actors connected to the network via a vpn with administrator credentials they obtained and opened an rdp session with the same credentials to move laterally  over a nine month period  they moved laterally to a file server  a domain controller  an oracle management server  oms   and a vmware vcenter server  the actors obtained domain credentials from the domain controller and performed discovery  collection  and exfiltration on the file server  see the discovery and collection and exfiltration sections  volt typhoon’s movement to the vcenter server was likely strategic for pre positioning to ot assets  the vcenter server was adjacent to ot assets  and volt typhoon actors were observed interacting with the putty application on the server by enumerating existing stored sessions  with this information  volt typhoon potentially had access to a range of critical putty profiles  including those for water treatment plants  water wells  an electrical substation  ot systems  and network security devices  this would enable them to access these critical systems  t1563   see figure 2 additionally  volt typhoon actors have been observed using psexec to execute remote processes  including the automated acceptance of the end user license agreement  eula  through an administrative account  signified by theaccepteula command flag volt typhoon actors may have attempted to move laterally to a cloud environment in one victim’s network but direct attribution to the volt typhoon group was inconclusive  during the period of the their known network presence  there were anomalous login attempts to an azure tenant  t1021 007  potentially using credentials  t1078 004  previously compromised from theft ofntds dit  these attempts  coupled with misconfigured virtual machines with open rdp ports  suggested a potential for cloud based lateral movement  however  subsequent investigations  including password changes and multifactor authentication  mfa  implementations  revealed authentication failures from non associated ip addresses  with no definitive link to volt typhoon collection and exfiltrationthe usa authoring agencies assess volt typhoon primarily collects information that would facilitate follow on actions with physical impacts  for example  in one confirmed compromise  they collected  ta0009  sensitive information obtained from a file server in multiple zipped files  t1560  and likely exfiltrated  ta0010  the files via server message block  smb   t1048   see figure 3   collected information included diagrams and documentation related to ot equipment  including supervisory control and data acquisition  scada  systems  relays  and switchgear  this data is crucial for understanding and potentially impacting critical infrastructure systems  indicating a focus on gathering intelligence that could be leveraged in actions targeting physical assets and systems in another compromise  volt typhoon actors leveraged wmic to create and use temporary directories  c  users public pro c  windows temp tmp c  windows temp tmp active directory andc  windows temp tmp

actors have been observed leveraging compromised soho routers and virtual private servers  vps  to proxy c2 traffic  for more information  see doj press release usa government disrupts botnet people’s republic of china used to conceal hacking of critical infrastructure  they have also been observed setting up frp clients  t1090  on a victim’s corporate infrastructure to establish covert communications channels  t1573  for command and control  in one instance  volt typhoon actors implanted the frp client with filenamesmsvcservice exe on a shortel enterprise contact center  ecc  server and a second frp client with filenamebrightmetricagent exe on another server  these clients  when executed via powershell  t1059 001   open reverse proxies between the compromised system and volt typhoon c2 servers brightmetricagent exe has additional capabilities  the frp client can locate servers behind a network firewall or obscured through network address translation  nat   t1016   it also contains multiplexer libraries that can bi directionally stream data over nat networks and contains a command line interface  cli  library that can leverage command shells such as powershell  windows management instrumentation  wmi   and z shell  zsh   t1059 004   see appendix c and mar 10448362 1 v1 for more information in the same compromise  volt typhoon actors exploited a paessler router traffic grapher  prtg  server as an intermediary for their frp operations  to facilitate this  they used the netsh command  a legitimate windows command  to create a portproxy registry modification  t1112  on the prtg server  t1090 001   this key alteration redirected specific port traffic to volt typhoon’s proxy infrastructure  effectively converting the prtg’s server into a proxy for their c2

cause a memory read or write of a single zero byte  in a pool  heap  memory location beyond the header value sent  this could cause the process to crash  this issue affects apache http server 2 4 54 and earlier a flaw was found in python  in algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non binary bases  when using int  text    a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100 000 digits and 5s for 1 000 000 digits  float  decimal  int from bytes    and int   for binary bases 2  4  8  16  and 32 are not affected   the highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability a flaw was found in libdnf s signature verification functionality in versions before 0 60 1  this flaw allows an attacker to achieve code execution if they can alter the header information of an rpm package and then trick a user or system into installing it  the highest risk of this vulnerability is to confidentiality  integrity  as well as system availability an out of bounds memory access flaw was found in the ati vga device emulation of qemu  this flaw occurs in the ati 2d blt   routine while handling mmio write operations when the guest provides invalid values for the destination display parameters  a malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the qemu process on the host  resulting in a denial of service a vulnerability was found in the fs inode c inode init owner   function logic of the linux kernel that allows local users to create files for the xfs file system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and sgid permission bits set  in a scenario where a directory is sgid and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group  this can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not  this vulnerability is similar to the previous cve 2018 13405 and adds the missed fix for the xfs an issue was discovered in dropbear through 2020 81  it is possible for an ssh server to change the login process in its favor due to a non rfc compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client side ssh code  this attack can bypass additional security measures such as fido2 tokens or ssh askpass  thus  it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed a denial of service vulnerability exists in mbed tls 3 0 0 and earlier in the mbedtls pkcs12 derivation function when an input password s length is 0 in mbed tls before 3 1 0  psa aead generate nonce allows policy bypass or oracle based decryption when the output buffer is at memory locations accessible to an untrusted application there is a flaw in the linux kernel in linux net netfilter nf tables api c of the netfilter subsystem  this flaw allows a local user to cause an out of bounds write issue there is a vulnerability in the way the state file is created in logrotate  the state file is used to prevent parallel executions of multiple instances of logrotate by acquiring and releasing a file lock  when the state file does not exist  it is created with world readable permission  allowing an unprivileged user to lock the state file  stopping any rotation  this flaw affects logrotate versions before 3 20 0 3 2 11 use after free cwe 416a use after free flaw was found in nf tables cross table in the net netfilter nf tables api c function in the linux kernel  this flaw allows a local  privileged attacker to cause a use after free problem at the time of table deletion  possibly leading to local privilege escalation requests forwarded by reverseproxy include raw query parameters from the inbound request  including unparsable parameters rejected by net http  this could permit query parameter smuggling when a go proxy forwards a parameter with an unparsable value  once the fix is applied  reverseproxy sanitizes the query parameters in the forwarded query when the outbound request s form field is set after the reverseproxy  director function returns  indicating that the proxy has parsed the query parameters  proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to forward the original query parameters unchanged users may have access to secure endpoints in the control plane network  kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can modify node objects and send proxy requests to them  kubernetes supports node proxying  which allows clients of kube apiserver to access endpoints of a kubelet to establish connections to pods  retrieve container logs  and more  while kubernetes already validates the proxying address for nodes  a bug in kube apiserver made it possible to bypass this validation  bypassing this validation could allow authenticated requests destined for nodes to to the api server s private network a heap based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in samba within the gssapi unwrap des   and unwrap des3   routines of heimdal  the des and triple des decryption routines in the heimdal gssapi library allow a length limited write buffer overflow on malloc   allocated memory when presented with a maliciously small packet  this flaw allows a remote user to send specially crafted malicious data to the application  possibly resulting in a denial of service attack a vulnerability was found in the libksba library due to an integer overflow within the crl parser  the vulnerability can be exploited remotely for code execution on the target system by passing specially crafted data to the application a vulnerability was found in systemd  this security flaw can cause a local information leak due to systemd coredump not respecting the fs suid dumpable kernel setting a potential memory leak issue was discovered in sdl2 in gles createtexture   function in sdl render gles c  the vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial of service attack  the vulnerability affects sdl2 v2 0 4 and above  sdl 1 x are not affected 3 2 18 double free cwe 415a double free flaw was found in the linux kernel s tun tap device driver functionality in how a user registers the device when the register netdevice function fails  netdev register notifier   this flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system 3 2 19 out of bounds write cwe 787a vulnerability was found in php where setting the environment variable php cli server workers to a large value leads to a heap buffer overflow a flaw was found in the c ares package  the ares set sortlist is missing checks for the validity of the input string  which allows a possible arbitrary length stack overflow  this issue may cause a denial of service or a limited impact on confidentiality and integrity containerd is an open source container runtime  a bug was found in containerd s cri implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host  in the cri stream server  a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a tty is requested  if the user s process fails to launch due to  for example  a faulty command  the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver  resulting in a memory leak  kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd s cri implementation and the stream server is used for handling container io  this bug has been fixed in containerd 1 6 12 and 1 5 16  users should update to these versions to resolve the issue  users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers git is distributed revision control system  gitattributes are a mechanism to allow defining attributes for paths  these attributes can be defined by adding a  gitattributes file to the repository  which contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern  when parsing gitattributes  multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns  a huge number of attributes for a single pattern  or when the declared attribute names are huge  these overflows can be triggered via a crafted  gitattributes file that may be part of the commit history  git silently splits lines longer than 2kb when parsing gitattributes from a file  but not when parsing them from the index  consequentially  the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working tree  the index or both  this integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes  which may result in remote code execution  the problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023 01 17  going back to v2 30 7  users are advised to upgrade  there are no known workarounds for this issue redis is an in memory database that persists on disk  a specially crafted lua script executing in redis can trigger a heap overflow in the cjson library  and result with heap corruption and potentially remote code execution  the problem exists in all versions of redis with lua scripting support  starting from 2 6  and affects only authenticated and authorized users  the problem is fixed in versions 7 0 12  6 2 13  and 6 0 20 3 2 24 incorrect comparison cwe 697a logic issue was addressed with improved state

787there is a possible overflow in handle image   when shim tries to load and execute crafted efi executables  the handle image   function takes into account the sizeofrawdata field from each section to be loaded  an attacker can leverage this to perform out of bound writes to memory  arbitrary code execution is not discarded in such scenario 3 2 26 double free cwe 415a double free was found in the regexp compiler in ruby 3 x before 3 0 4 and 3 1 x before 3 1 2  if a victim attempts to create a regexp from untrusted user input  an attacker may be able to write to unexpected memory locations 3 2 27 out of bounds read cwe 125there is a buffer over read in ruby before 2 6 10  2 7 x before 2 7 6  3 x before 3 0 4  and 3 1 x before 3 1 2  it occurs in string to float conversion  including kernel float and string to f an issue was discovered in rsync before 3 2 5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary files inside the directories of connecting peers  the server chooses which files or directories are sent to the client  however  the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names  a malicious rsync server  or man in the middle attacker  can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories  for example  overwrite the  ssh authorized keys file  runc is a cli tool for spawning and running containers on linux according to the oci specification  a bug was found in runc prior to version 1 1 2 where runc exec   cap created processes with non empty inheritable linux process capabilities  creating an atypical linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve 2   this bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container s bounding set  this bug has been fixed in runc 1 1 2  this fix changes runc exec   cap behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed  as specified via   caparguments  do not include inheritable capabilities  in addition  runc spec is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example oci spec  config json  file git is a distributed revision control system  git prior to versions 2 37 1  2 36 2  2 35 4  2 34 4  2 33 4  2 32 3  2 31 4  and 2 30 5  is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all platforms  an unsuspecting user could still be affected by the issue reported in cve 2022 24765  for example when navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is owned by them  but where an attacker could create a git repository  versions 2 37 1  2 36 2  2 35 4  2 34 4  2 33 4  2 32 3  2 31 4  and 2 30 5 contain a patch for this issue  the simplest way to avoid being affected by the exploit described in the example is to avoid running git as root  or an administrator in windows   and if needed to reduce its use to a minimum  while a generic workaround is not possible  a system could be hardened from the exploit described in the example by removing any such repository if it exists already and creating one as root to block any future attacks 3 2 31 out of bounds write cwe 787in gnome epiphany before 41 4 and 42 x before 42 2  an html document can trigger a client buffer overflow  in ephy string shorten in the ui process  via a long page title  the issue occurs because the number of bytes for a utf 8 ellipsis character is not properly considered improper exposure of client ip addresses in net http before go 1 17 12 and go 1 18 4 can be triggered by calling httputil reverseproxy servehttp with a request header map containing a nil value for the x forwarded for header  which causes reverseproxy to set the client ip as the value of the x forwarded for header gnupg through 2 3 6  in unusual situations where an attacker possesses any secret key information from a victim s keyring and other constraints  e g   use of gpgme  are met  allows signature forgery via injection into the status line an issue was discovered in the linux kernel through 5 18 9  a type confusion bug in nft set elem init  leading to a buffer overflow  could be used by a local attacker to escalate privileges  a different vulnerability than cve 2022 32250   the attacker can obtain root access  but must start with an unprivileged user namespace to obtain cap net admin access   this can be fixed in nft setelem parse data in net netfilter nf tables api c redis is an in memory database that persists on disk  authenticated users can use string matching commands  like scan or keys  with a specially crafted pattern to trigger a denial of service attack on redis  causing it to hang and consume 100  cpu time  the problem is fixed in redis versions 6 0 18  6 2 11  7 0 9 in libarchive before 3 6 2  the software does not check for an error after calling calloc function that can return with a null pointer if the function fails  which leads to a resultant null pointer dereference  note  the discoverer cites this cwe 476 remark but third parties dispute the code execution impact   in rare circumstances  when null is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it  then writing or reading memory is possible  which may lead to code execution  inconsistent interpretation of http requests   http request smuggling   vulnerability in mod proxy ajp of apache http server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to the ajp server it forwards requests to  this issue affects apache http server apache http server 2 4 version 2 4 54 and prior versions prior to apache http server 2 4 55  a malicious backend can cause the response headers to be truncated early  resulting in some headers being incorporated into the response body  if the later headers have any security purpose  they will not be interpreted by the client the keccak xkcp sha 3 reference implementation before fdc6fef has an integer overflow and resultant buffer overflow that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or eliminate expected cryptographic properties  this occurs in the sponge function interface in lighttpd 1 4 65  mod wstunnel does not initialize a handler function pointer if an invalid http request  websocket handshake  is received  it leads to null pointer dereference which crashes the server  it could be used by an external attacker to cause denial of service condition an integer overflow in the rfc3164 parser in one identity syslog ng 3 0 through 3 37 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via crafted syslog input that is mishandled by the tcp or network function  syslog ng premium edition 7 0 30 and syslog ng store box 6 10 0 are also affected an issue was discovered the x86 kvm subsystem

344,february 6  2024governments around the world  seeking to spy on rights activists  dissidents and others of interest to them  have driven a sharp proliferation in commercial spyware vendors  csv  in recent years  with more and more cyber weapons brokers wading into the market what once used to be the domain of israel based nso group—the purveyor of the infamous pegasus spyware program — and a handful of others  is now crowded with dozens of small csvs with varying levels of sophistication and capabilities  according to google s  buying spying  report released today  their operations  though often targeted at only a relatively small number of individuals  have significantly broader repercussions  google warned in a comprehensive new report on the troubling trend  we have not seen evidence of csv customers using spyware to attempt to hack the enterprise as a whole   a researcher from google threat analysis group  tag  tells dark reading csvs account for nearly half of all google 0 day exploitsone of the biggest manifestations of the internet wide threat these vendors present is their role in finding and exploiting zero day vulnerabilities in widely used products from google  apple  and numerous other major technology providers google identified csvs as being behind nearly half of the known zero day exploits — 35 out of 72 — in its technologies between mid 2014 and the end of 2023  csvs also accounted for a stunning 20 out of the 25 total zero day vulnerabilities that researchers from the google tag observed attackers exploiting in the wild last year  and even those numbers are almost certainly on the lower side  google said the rising alarm over the trend pushed the biden administration into issuing an executive order in march 2023 that is designed to counter and prevent the proliferation of commercial spyware products that pose a risk to activists  dissidents  journalists  and others  and in addition to google s report  several other firms such as apple  toronto university s citizen labs  cisco  the european parliament  and the carnegie endowment have highlighted the rampant growth of csv operations globally a spyware explosionmuch of the concern has to do with the explosion in the availability of tools and services that allow governments and law enforcement to break into target devices with impunity  harvest information from them  and spy unchecked on victims  the vendors selling these tools — most of which are designed for mobile devices — have often openly pitched their wares as legitimate tools that aid in law enforcement and counter terrorism efforts but the reality is that repressive governments have routinely used spyware tools against journalists  activists  dissidents  and opposition party politicians  said google the company s report cites three instances of such misuse  one that targeted a human rights defender working with a mexico based rights organization  another against an exiled russian journalist  and the third against the co founder and director of a salvadorian investigative news outlet the price tag for end to end surveillancethe researcher attributes much of the recent growth in the csv market to strong demand from governments around the world to outsource their need for spyware tools rather than have an advanced persistent threat build them in house  governments no longer have to rely on building their own capabilities  but can purchase a contract for guaranteed exploits  and a full service tool from delivery to installation to analysis of the collected data   the google tag researcher says google s report pointed to greece based intellexa  a vendor that the company and amnesty international recently warned about  as an example of the end to end surveillance capabilities that csvs can offer today for government customers — and the price tag for those services   for €8 million the customer receives the capability to use a remote one click exploit chain to install spyware implants on android and ios devices  with the ability to run 10 concurrent spyware implants at any one time   google said the baseline price gives government and or law enforcement users the ability to install and manage intellexa s nova system—which includes its predator spyware implant and a data analysis system—on devices within the purchasing customers country and using the country s sim cards  it also includes a one year maintenance guarantee  meaning that if a zero day exploit the vendor might have used in the chain gets patched  the customer will get a new exploit  google said customers willing to pay an additional €1 2 million  about  1 3 million  get the ability to infect android and ios devices in five additional countries and for another €3 million   3 2 million  they get guaranteed persistence on target devices  if  state sponsored actors  ever had a monopoly on the most sophisticated capabilities  that era is certainly over   google said in its report   the private sector is now responsible for a significant portion of the most sophisticated tools we detect  the exploitation supply chain growsintellexa  which is actually an alliance of several csvs  is not the only new entrant of note  others include negg group of italy  spain based variston  and cy4gate  an italian provider of spyware products for ios and android devices  in total  google is tracking some 40 vendors that currently sell spyware products to governments and intelligence agencies worldwide  while prominent csvs like nso group garner public attention and headlines  there are dozens of smaller csvs  as well as other important parts of the exploitation supply chain  which play an important role in the development of spyware   google said   all these players enable the proliferation of dangerous tools and capabilities used by governments against individuals  which threatens the safety of the internet ecosystem and the trust on which a vibrant and inclusive digital
