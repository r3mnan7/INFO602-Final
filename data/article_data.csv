CISA Warns of Active Exploitation Apple iOS and macOS Vulnerability,"The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Wednesday added a high-severity flaw impacting iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-48618 (CVSS score: 7.8), concerns a bug in the kernel component.""An attacker with arbitrary read and write capability may be able to bypass Pointer Authentication,"" Apple said in an advisory, adding the issue ""may have been exploited against versions of iOS released before iOS 15.7.1.""The iPhone maker said the problem was addressed with improved checks. It's currently not known how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world attacks.Interestingly, patches for the flaw were released on December 13, 2022, with the release of iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2, macOS Ventura 13.1, tvOS 16.2, and watchOS 9.2, although it was only publicly disclosed more than a year later on January 9, 2024.It's worth noting that Apple did resolve a similar flaw in the kernel (CVE-2022-32844, CVSS score: 6.3) in iOS 15.6 and iPadOS 15.6, which was shipped on July 20, 2022. It's not immediately clear if the two vulnerabilities are related.""An app with arbitrary kernel read and write capability may be able to bypass Pointer Authentication,"" the company said at the time. ""A logic issue was addressed with improved state management.""In light of the active exploitation of CVE-2022-48618, CISA is recommending that Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies apply the fixes by February 21, 2024.The development also comes as Apple expanded patches for an actively exploited security flaw in the WebKit browser engine (CVE-2024-23222, CVSS score: 8.8) to include its Apple Vision Pro headset.

"HeadCrab 2.0 Goes Fileless, Targeting Redis Servers for Crypto Mining","Cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of the malware HeadCrab that's known to target Redis database servers across the world since early September 2021.The development, which comes exactly a year after the malware was first publicly disclosed by Aqua, is a sign that the financially-motivated threat actor behind the campaign is actively adapting and refining their tactics and techniques to stay ahead of the detection curve.The cloud security firm said that ""the campaign has almost doubled the number of infected Redis servers,"" with an additional 1,100 compromised servers, up from 1,200 reported at the start of 2023.HeadCrab is designed to infiltrate internet-exposed Redis servers and wrangle them into a botnet for illicitly mining cryptocurrency, while also leveraging the access in a manner that allows the threat actor to execute shell commands, load fileless kernel modules, and exfiltrate data to a remote server.While the origins of the threat actor are presently not known, they make it a point to note in a ""mini blog"" embedded into the malware that the mining activity is ""legal in my country"" and that they do it because ""it almost doesn't harm human life and feelings (if done right).""The operator, however, acknowledges that it's a ""parasitic and inefficient way"" of making money, adding their aim is to make $15,000 per year.""An integral aspect of the sophistication of HeadCrab 2.0 lies in its advanced evasion techniques,"" Aqua researchers Asaf Eitani and Nitzan Yaakov said. ""In contrast to its predecessor (named HeadCrab 1.0), this new version employs a fileless loader mechanism, demonstrating the attacker's commitment to stealth and persistence.""It's worth noting that the previous iteration utilized the SLAVEOF command to download and save the HeadCrab malware file to disk, thereby leaving artifact traces on the file system.HeadCrab 2.0, on the other hand, receives the malware's content over the Redis communication channel and stores it in a fileless location in a bid to minimize the forensic trail and make it much more challenging to detect.Also changed in the new variant is the use of the Redis MGET command for command-and-control (C2) communications for added covertness.""By hooking into this standard command, the malware gains the ability to control it during specific attacker-initiated requests,"" the researchers said.""Those requests are achieved by sending a special string as an argument to the MGET command. When this specific string is detected, the malware recognizes the command as originating from the attacker, triggering the malicious C2 communication.""Describing HeadCrab 2.0 as an escalation in the sophistication of Redis malware, Aqua said its ability to masquerade its malicious activities under the guise of legitimate commands poses new problems for detection.""This evolution underscores the necessity for continuous research and development in security tools and practices,"" the researchers concluded. ""The engagement by the attacker and the subsequent evolution of the malware highlights the critical need for vigilant monitoring and intelligence gathering.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Russian APT28 Hackers Targeting High-Value Orgs with NTLM Relay Attacks,"Russian state-sponsored actors have staged NT LAN Manager (NTLM) v2 hash relay attacks through various methods from April 2022 to November 2023, targeting high-value targets worldwide.The attacks, attributed to an ""aggressive"" hacking crew called APT28, have set their eyes on organizations dealing with foreign affairs, energy, defense, and transportation, as well as those involved with labor, social welfare, finance, parenthood, and local city councils.Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro assessed these intrusions as a ""cost-efficient method of automating attempts to brute-force its way into the networks"" of its targets, noting the adversary may have compromised thousands of email accounts over time.APT28 is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the names Blue Athena, BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, Fighting Ursa, Forest Blizzard (formerly Strontium), FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, ITG05, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and TA422.The group, believed to be active since at least 2009, is operated by Russia's GRU military intelligence service and has a track record of orchestrating spear-phishing campaigns bearing malicious attachments or strategic web compromises to activate the infection chains.In April 2023, APT28 was implicated in attacks leveraging now-patched flaws in networking equipment from Cisco to conduct reconnaissance and deploy malware against select targets.The nation-state actor, in December, came under the spotlight for exploiting a privilege escalation flaw in Microsoft Outlook (CVE-2023-23397, CVSS score: 9.8) and a code execution bug in WinRAR (CVE-2023-38831, CVSS score: 7.8) to access a user's Net-NTLMv2 hash and use it to stage an NTLM relay attack for gaining unauthorized access to mailboxes belonging to public and private sector firms.An exploit for CVE-2023-23397 is said to have been used to target Ukrainian entities as early as April 2022, according to a March 2023 advisory from CERT-EU.It has also been observed leveraging lures related to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war to facilitate the delivery of a custom backdoor called HeadLace, alongside striking Ukrainian government entities and Polish organizations with phishing messages designed to deploy bespoke implants and information stealers like OCEANMAP, MASEPIE, and STEELHOOK.One of the significant aspects of the threat actor's attacks is the continuous attempt to improve its operational playbook, fine-tuning and tinkering with its approaches to evade detection.This includes the addition of anonymization layers such as VPN services, Tor, data center IP addresses, and compromised EdgeOS routers to carry out scanning and probing activities. Another tactic entails sending spear-phishing messages from compromised email accounts over Tor or VPN.""Pawn Storm has also been using EdgeOS routers to send spear-phishing emails, perform callbacks of CVE-2023-23397 exploits in Outlook, and proxy credential theft on credential phishing websites,"" security researchers Feike Hacquebord and Fernando Merces said.""Part of the group's post-exploitation activities involve the modification of folder permissions within the victim's mailbox, leading to enhanced persistence,"" the researchers said. ""Using the victim's email accounts, lateral movement is possible by sending additional malicious email messages from within the victim organization.""It's currently not known if the threat actor themselves breached these routers, or if it is using routers that were already compromised by a third-party actor. That said, no less than 100 EdgeOS routers are estimated to have been infected.Furthermore, recent credential harvesting campaigns against European governments have used bogus login pages mimicking Microsoft Outlook that are hosted on webhook[.]site URLs, a pattern previously attributed to the group.In a sign that the group in no stranger to pivoting and shifting tactics when needed, an October 2022 phishing campaign singled out embassies and other high-profile entities to deliver a ""simple"" information stealer via emails that captured files matching specific extensions and exfiltrated them to a free file-sharing service named Keep.sh.""The loudness of the repetitive, oftentimes crude and aggressive campaigns, drown out the silence, subtlety, and complexity of the initial intrusion, as well as the post-exploitation actions that might occur once Pawn Storm gets an initial foothold in victim organizations,"" the researchers said.The development comes as Recorded Future News revealed an ongoing hacking campaign undertaken by the Russian threat actor COLDRIVER (aka Calisto, Iron Frontier, or Star Blizzard) that impersonates researchers and academics to redirect prospective victims to credential harvesting pages.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
"DirtyMoe Malware Infects 2,000+ Ukrainian Computers for DDoS and Cryptojacking","The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned that more than 2,000 computers in the country have been infected by a strain of malware called DirtyMoe.The agency attributed the campaign to a threat actor it calls UAC-0027.DirtyMoe, active since at least 2016, is capable of carrying out cryptojacking and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In March 2022, cybersecurity firm Avast revealed the malware's ability to propagate in a worm-like fashion by taking advantage of known security flaws.The DDoS botnet is known to be delivered by means of another malware referred to as Purple Fox or via bogus MSI installer packages for popular software such as Telegram. Purple Fox is also equipped with a rootkit that allows the threat actors to hide the malware on the machine and make it difficult to detect and remove.The exact initial access vector used in the campaign targeting Ukraine is currently unknown. CERT-UA is recommending that organizations keep their systems up-to-date, enforce network segmentation, and monitor network traffic for any anomalous activity.The disclosure comes as Securonix detailed an ongoing phishing campaign known as STEADY#URSA targeting Ukrainian military personnel with the goal of delivering a bespoke PowerShell backdoor dubbed SUBTLE-PAWS.""The exploitation chain is relatively simple: it involves the target executing a malicious shortcut (.lnk) file which loads and executes a new PowerShell backdoor payload code (found inside another file contained within the same archive),"" security researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov said.The attack is said to be related to a threat actor known as Shuckworm, which is also known as Aqua Blizzard (formerly Actinium), Armageddon, Gamaredon, Iron Tilden, Primitive Bear, Trident Ursa, UNC530, and Winterflounder. Active since at least 2013, it's assessed to be part of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).SUBTLE-PAWS, in addition to setting up persistence on the host, uses Telegram's blogging platform called Telegraph to retrieve the command-and-control (C2) information, a technique previously identified as associated with the adversary since early 2023, and can propagate through removable attached drives.Gamaredon's ability to spread via USB drives was also documented by Check Point in November 2023, which named the PowerShell-based USB worm LitterDrifter.""The new SUBTLE-PAWS attack payload can be viewed as an evolution of the attack payloads by the malicious threat actor involved in the [LitterDrifter] campaign,"" Kolesnikov, vice president of threat research and data science/AI at Securonix, told The Hacker News.""For instance, LitterDrifter is vbscript-based. SUBTLE-PAWS is PowerShell. There are also differences in how these payloads work, SUBTLE-PAWS uses a different persistence mechanism, for example.""""The SUBTLE-PAWS backdoor uses advanced techniques to execute malicious payloads dynamically,"" the researchers said.""They store and retrieve executable PowerShell code from the Windows Registry which can assist in evading traditional file-based detection methods. This approach also aids in maintaining persistence on the infected system, as the malware can initiate itself again after reboots or other interruptions.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Pegasus Spyware Targeted iPhones of Journalists and Activists in Jordan,"The iPhones belonging to nearly three dozen journalists, activists, human rights lawyers, and civil society members in Jordan have been targeted with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware, according to joint findings from Access Now and the Citizen Lab.Nine of the 35 individuals have been publicly confirmed as targeted, out of whom six had their devices compromised with the mercenary surveillanceware tool. The infections are estimated to have taken place from at least 2019 until September 2023.""In some cases, perpetrators posed as journalists, seeking an interview or a quote from victims, while embedding malicious links to Pegasus spyware amid and in between their messages,"" Access Now said.""A number of victims were reinfected with Pegasus spyware multiple times — demonstrating the relentless nature of this targeted surveillance campaign.""The Israeli company has been under the radar for failing to implement rigorous human rights safeguards prior to selling its cyber intelligence technology to government clients and law enforcement agencies for ""preventing and investigating terrorism and serious crimes.""NSO Group, in its 2023 Transparency and Responsibility Report, touted a ""significant decrease"" in reports of product misuse during 2022 and 2023, attributing the downturn to its due diligence and review process.""Cyber intelligence technology enables government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to carry out their basic duties to prevent violence and safeguard the public,"" the company noted.""Importantly, it allows them to counter the widespread deployment of end-to-end encryption applications by terrorists and criminals without engaging in mass surveillance or obtaining backdoor access to the devices of all users.""It further sought to ""dispel falsehoods"" about Pegasus, stating it is not a mass surveillance tool, that it's licensed to legitimate, vetted intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and that it cannot take control of a device or penetrate computer networks, desktop, or laptop operating systems.""It is technologically impossible for Pegasus to add, alter, delete, or otherwise manipulate data on targeted mobile devices, or perform any other activities beyond viewing and/or extracting certain data,"" NSO Group said.Despite these assurances, the invasive spyware attacks targeting Jordan civil society members underscore the continued pattern of abuse that run counter to the company's claims.Access Now said the victims' devices were infiltrated with both zero-click and one-click attacks using Apple iOS exploits like FORCEDENTRY, FINDMYPWN, PWNYOURHOME, and BLASTPASS to breach security guardrails and deliver Pegasus via social engineering attacks.The attacks were characterized by the propagation of malicious links to victims via WhatsApp and SMS, with the attackers posing as journalists to increase the likelihood of success of the campaign.The non-profit further said that enabling Lockdown Mode on the iPhones likely prevented some of the devices from being re-infected again with the spyware. It also called on world governments, including Jordan's, to halt the use of such tools and enforce a moratorium on their sale until adequate countermeasures are adopted.""Surveillance technologies and cyberweapons such as NSO Group's Pegasus spyware are used to target human rights defenders and journalists, to intimidate and dissuade them from their work, to infiltrate their networks, and to gather information for use against other targets,"" Access Now said.""The targeted surveillance of individuals violates their right to privacy, freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. It also creates a chilling effect, forcing individuals to self-censor and cease their activism or journalistic work, for fear of reprisal.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,vulnerability reports,FALSE
New Mispadu Banking Trojan Exploiting Windows SmartScreen Flaw,"The threat actors behind the Mispadu banking Trojan have become the latest to exploit a now-patched Windows SmartScreen security bypass flaw to compromise users in Mexico.The attacks entail a new variant of the malware that was first observed in 2019, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said in a report published last week.Propagated via phishing mails, Mispadu is a Delphi-based information stealer known to specifically infect victims in the Latin American (LATAM) region. In March 2023, Metabase Q revealed that Mispadu spam campaigns harvested no less than 90,000 bank account credentials since August 2022.It's also part of the larger family of LATAM banking malware, including Grandoreiro, which was dismantled by Brazilian law enforcement authorities last week.The latest infection chain identified by Unit 42 employs rogue internet shortcut files contained within bogus ZIP archive files that leverage CVE-2023-36025 (CVSS score: 8.8), a high-severity bypass flaw in Windows SmartScreen. It was addressed by Microsoft in November 2023.""This exploit revolves around the creation of a specifically crafted internet shortcut file (.URL) or a hyperlink pointing to malicious files that can bypass SmartScreen's warnings,"" security researchers Daniela Shalev and Josh Grunzweig said.""The bypass is simple and relies on a parameter that references a network share, rather than a URL. The crafted .URL file contains a link to a threat actor's network share with a malicious binary.""Mispadu, once launched, reveals its true colors by selectively targeting victims based on their geographic location (i.e., Americas or Western Europe) and system configurations, and then proceeds to establish contact with a command-and-control (C2) server for follow-on data exfiltration.In recent months, the Windows flaw has been exploited in the wild by multiple cybercrime groups to deliver DarkGate and Phemedrone Stealer malware to steal sensitive data from infected machines and drop more payloads.Mexico has also emerged as a top target for several campaigns over the past year that have been found to propagate information stealers and remote access trojans like AllaKore RAT, AsyncRAT, Babylon RAT. This constitutes a financially-motivated group dubbed TA558 that has attacked the hospitality and travel sectors in the LATAM region since 2018.The development comes as Sekoia detailed the inner workings of DICELOADER (aka Lizar or Tirion), a time-tested custom downloader used by the Russian e-crime group tracked as FIN7. The malware has been observed delivered via malicious USB drives (aka BadUSB) in the past.""DICELOADER is dropped by a PowerShell script along with other malware of the intrusion set's arsenal such as Carbanak RAT,"" the French cybersecurity firm said, calling out its sophisticated obfuscation methods to conceal the C2 IP addresses and the network communications.",data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,TRUE
U.S. Sanctions 6 Iranian Officials for Critical Infrastructure Cyber Attacks,"The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions against six officials associated with the Iranian intelligence agency for attacking critical infrastructure entities in the U.S. and other countries.The officials include Hamid Reza Lashgarian, Mahdi Lashgarian, Hamid Homayunfal, Milad Mansuri, Mohammad Bagher Shirinkar, and Reza Mohammad Amin Saberian, who are part of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC).Reza Lashgarian is also the head of the IRGC-CEC and a commander in the IRGC-Qods Force. He is alleged to have been involved in various IRGC cyber and intelligence operations.The Treasury Department said it's holding these individuals responsible for carrying out ""cyber operations in which they hacked and posted images on the screens of programmable logic controllers manufactured by Unitronics, an Israeli company.""In late November 2023, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) revealed that the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa in western Pennsylvania was targeted by Iranian threat actors by exploiting Unitronics PLCs.The attack was attributed to an Iranian hacktivist persona dubbed Cyber Av3ngers, which came to the forefront in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas conflict, staging destructive attacks against entities in Israel and the U.S.The group, which has been active since 2020, is also said to be behind several other cyber attacks, including one targeting Boston Children's Hospital in 2021 and others in Europe and Israel.""Industrial control devices, such as programmable logic controllers, used in water and other critical infrastructure systems, are sensitive targets,"" the Treasury Department noted.""Although this particular operation did not disrupt any critical services, unauthorized access to critical infrastructure systems can enable actions that harm the public and cause devastating humanitarian consequences.""The development comes as another pro-Iranian ""psychological operation group"" known as Homeland Justice said it attacked Albania's Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) and claimed to have stolen terabytes of data.Homeland Justice has a track record of targeting Albania since mid-July 2022, with the threat actor most recently observed delivering a wiper malware codenamed No-Justice.",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
Hands-On Review: SASE-based XDR from Cato Networks,"Companies are engaged in a seemingly endless cat-and-mouse game when it comes to cybersecurity and cyber threats. As organizations put up one defensive block after another, malicious actors kick their game up a notch to get around those blocks. Part of the challenge is to coordinate the defensive abilities of disparate security tools, even as organizations have limited resources and a dearth of skilled cybersecurity experts.XDR, or Extended Detection and Response, addresses this challenge. XDR platforms correlate indicators from across security domains to detect threats and then provide the tools to remediate incidents.While XDR has many benefits, legacy approaches have been hampered by the lack of good-quality data. You might end up having a very good view of a threat from events generated by your EPP/EDR system but lack events about the network perspective (or vice versa). XDR products will import data from third-party sensors, but data comes in different formats. The XDR platform needs to normalize the data, which then degrades its quality. As a result, threats may be incorrectly identified or missed, or incident reports may lack the necessary information for quick investigation and remediation.Cato's Unique Approach to Reducing ComplexityAll of which makes Cato Networks' approach to XDR particularly intriguing. Announced in January, Cato XDR is, as Cato Networks puts it, the first ""SASE-based"" XDR product. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) is an approach that converges security and networking into the cloud. SASE would seem to be a natural fit for XDR as there are many native sensors already in a SASE platform. Gartner who defined SASE in 2019 talks about a SASE platform including ""SD-WAN, SWG, CASB, NGFW and zero trust network access (ZTNA)"" but those are only the required capabilities. SASE may also include advanced security capabilities such as remote browser isolation, network sandboxing, and DNS protection. With so many native sensors already built into the SASE platform, you could avoid the biggest problem with XDR – the lack of good data.Cato SASE Cloud is the prototypical example of what Gartner means by SASE and, on paper at least, Cato XDR would tap the full power of what SASE has to offer goal. The Cato SASE Cloud comes with a rich set of native sensors spanning the network and endpoint -- NGFW, advanced threat prevention (IPS, NGAM, and DNS Security), SWG, CASB, DLP, ZTNA, RBI, and EPP/EDR. The latter, EPP/EDR, is just as new as Cato XDR. Cato EPP is built on Bitdefender's malware prevention technology and stores customer and endpoint data in the same data lake as the rest of the Cato SASE network data. XDR users end up with an incredibly rich ""surround sound"" view (pardon the mixed metaphor) of an incident with detailed data gathered from many native sensors. Cato's capabilities are instantly on and always available at scale, providing a single shared context to hunt for, detect, and respond to threats. For those who have their own EPP/EDR solutions in place, Cato can work for them as well. Cato XDR integrates with leading EDR providers such as Microsoft Defender, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne.Testing EnvironmentThe review is going to focus on a day in the life of a security analyst using Cato XDR. We'll learn how an analyst can see a snapshot of the security threats on the network and the process for investigating and remediating them. In our scenario, we've been informed of malware at 10:59 PM. We'll investigate and then remediate the incident.It's important to understand that Cato XDR is not sold as a standalone product, but as part of the larger Cato SASE Cloud. It leverages all capabilities – sensors, analytics, UI and more – of the Cato SASE Cloud. So, to fully appreciate Cato XDR, one should be familiar with the rest of the Cato platform to best appreciate the simplicity and – what Cato calls ""elegance"" – of the platform. But doing so would make it difficult, if not impossible, to have room to review Cato XDR. We chose to take a cursory look at Cato overall but then focus on Cato XDR. (You can see a more complete albeit outdated review of the platform from back in 2017.)Getting into Cato XDRAs we enter the Cato SASE Cloud platform, they're greeted with a customized view of the enterprise network. Security, access, and networking capabilities are available from pull-down menus across the top and dashboards and specific capabilities for investigation, detection, and response, and practices assessments down the vertical. Accessing Cato XDR is under the Detection & Response section. To explore Cato XDR capabilities, visit Cato XDR.|Cato XDR is accessible from the left-hand side of the screen (indicated by the red box). Note: topology shown does not reflect our test environment.Putting Cato XDR to the TestClicking on the Stories Dashboard of Cato XDR gives us an overall view of the stories in the enterprise (see below). A ""story"" for Cato is a correlation of events generated by one or multiple sensors. The story tells the narrative of a threat from its inception to resolution. The first thing we noticed is that the Stories Dashboard has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, making it simple to navigate and understand for security analysts of varying skill levels. We feel this is crucial for efficient investigations and decision-making.To get a quick understanding of the overall risk score of the account, we looked at the AI-powered Account Risk Score widget. In this case, the overall risk score is 75—so, fairly high. This tells us we need to dig in and see what's leading to such a high score. There are 55 incidents stories in all, 24 of which are open and 30 of which are closed.|The Cato XDR Stories Dashboard summarizes the state of stories across the enterprise. Across the top, AI is used to evaluate the overall risk of the account (1) with the status of the various stories and additional counters across vertical (2).Below the overall summary line, we have widgets help us understand our stories from different perspectives. The highest priority stories are sorted by an AI-powered criticality store (1). The score is based on all the story risk scores for the selected time range and is calculated using a formula developed by the Cato research and development team. This is helpful in telling us which stories should be addressed first. We can also quickly see the hosts (Top 5 Hosts) and sites (Top 5 Sites) involved in the most stories (2). Scrolling down we see additional graphs capturing the story breakdown by criticality (3); Indicator of Attack (IoA) such as Malware Activity, Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), and Suspicious Network Activity (4); and MITRE ATT&CK techniques, such as Application Layer Protocol, Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, and Automated Exfiltration Mitigation (5).|Widgets help tell the threat story from different perspectives by criticality (1), the hosts and sites involved in the most stories (2), story breakdown by criticality (3), by IoAs (4), and by Mitre ATT&CK techniques (5).As analysts, we want to see which stories are open. A click on the 24 open stories in the summary line of the Stories Dashboard brings us to the Stories Workbench page (also accessible from the navigation on the left-side of the screen), which displays a prioritized list of all stories for efficient triage and better focus. Cato uses an AI-powered Criticality score to rank the stories (1). We can also add more filters and narrow down the list even further to enable better focus in the filter row (2). Grouping options also enable easier analysis (3).|The Stories Workbench lists the available Stories, which in this case is filtered to show the Open stories ranked by criticality (1). Further filtering (2) and grouping (3) options allow for efficient triage and investigation.We decided to examine the distribution of threats in the Stories Workbench screen by grouping threats by their Unique Indications. Now, we can see threats by category -- Malware Activity, Suspicious Network Activity, Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), and so on. DGA is a technique used by malware authors to dynamically generate many domain names. This is commonly employed by certain types of malware, such as botnets and other malicious software, to establish communication with command-and-control servers. We went to the final story at 10:59 PM and opened it for investigation.|The Stories Workbench screen grouped by indications, showing the stories with domain generation algorithms (DGAs). We investigated the final DGA story.The investigation screen shows a methodological process with tools for analyzing threats from the top down, gaining a high-level understanding of situation and then delving deeper into the investigation. First is the summary line of the story (1). We can see that the type of attack detected is Domain Generation Algorithm, that this is a threat-hunting story, and that the number of Associated Signals, which are the network flows that make up the story, is 26. Threat hunting stories contain correlated security events and network flows and using AI/ML and Threat Hunting heuristics to detect elusive signatureless and zero-day threats that cannot be blocked by prevention tools.We can see that the story duration is nine days, indicating that we found Associated Signals within a time span of nine days, and of course, that the status of the story is open. Next, we see the status line, which records the actions that took place in the story (2). Currently, we see that the status was ""created."" Additional actions will be added as we work on the story. Moving on to the details, we can quickly see that the Domain Generation Algorithm, or DGA, was found on Robin's Host 7. We see that the attack direction is outbound, and the AI-powered criticality score is 5.For an easy-to-read understanding of the story, we can click on the ""See Summary"" button. Cato's Gen AI engine summarizes the results of the screen in easy-to-read text. Details include the type of communication, the IP source, the targets, why the story was detected, and if any actions were taken automatically, such as blocking the traffic.|Clicking on the ""Story Summary"" button (1) generates a textual summary of the screen using Cato's Gen AI engine.Closing the Story Summary and staying on the investigation screen, we gain additional insights about the story. Cato's machine learning-powered Predicted Verdict analyzes the various indicators in the story and based on previous knowledge provides an expected verdict (1). Another smart insight is the ""Similar Stories,"" which is also powered by AI and, when relevant, will link to stories with similar characteristics. There's also the Playbook Knowledge Base (highlighted) to guide us on how to investigate stories of Malicious Target Communication.On the right side of the screen, we can see the source details (2): the IP, the OS, and the client. We see that this is a Tor browser, which can be suspicious. Tor is a web browser specifically designed for privacy and anonymity, and attackers often use it to conceal their identity and activity online.We can see the attack geolocation source (3), which communicates with different countries on different parts of the map. This can also be suspicious. Next, we look at the Target Actions box (4) where we can see actions that relate to every target involved in this story. Since this is a threat-hunting story, we can see a correlation between a broad set of signals.Scrolling down we examine the attack distribution timeline. We can see here that the communication to the targets has been going on for nine days.|The attack distribution timeline provides a chronological list of the attacks on the various targets. Clicking on the targets allows analysts to add or remove them from the graphic to better see the attack pattern.By filtering out some of the targets, we can see patterns of communications, which are easily observable. We clearly see a periodic activity that is indicative of bot- or script- initiated communication. Under the attack timeline, the Targets table (1) provides additional details about the targets, including their IPs, domain names, and related threat intelligence. The targets are sorted by malicious score. This is a smart score powered by AI and ML that takes all of Cato's threat intelligence sources, both proprietary and third party, and calculates the score between zero and one to indicate whether the IP is considered highly malicious or not.|Removing all but four of the targets show a periodic communication pattern, which is indicative of a bot or script. Below the attack distribution timelines is the Targets table with extensive information about the targets in the investigation.The popularity column shows if the IP is ""popular"" or ""unpopular"" as determined by Cato's proprietary algorithm measuring how often an IP or domain is visited according to Cato internal data. Unpopular IPs or domains are often indicative of suspicious IPs or domains. We can gain external threat intelligence information about the target by clicking third-party threat intelligence links such as VirusTotal, WhoIs, and AbusePDB.|External threat intelligence sources are just a click away from within the Targets table.Scrolling down to the Attack Related Flows table, we can view more granular details about the raw network flows that compose the story, such as the start time of the traffic and the source and destination ports. In this particular case, the destination ports are unusually high (9001) and less common, which raises a red flag.Documenting What We Found with CatoLet's summarize our findings from our test case. We found suspicious network activity related to domain generation algorithm that uses the Tor client. The IP has low popularity, high malicious scoring, and the communication follows a specific pattern in distinct times. So, we can now reach a conclusion. We suspect that there is a malware installed on the source endpoint, Robin's Host 7, and that it's trying to communicate outside using Tor infrastructure.Now let's set up the verdict in the screen below. We'll classify the story as malicious. The analyst severity would be medium. The type is anonymizer. We can see the details in the image below. The classification would be DGA. Then we can save the verdict on this incident story.|The security analyst can document a verdict to help others understand the threat.Once saved, we can see that that opening threat hunting screen has been updated. The second row now shows that the analyst has set the severity to Medium, and the verdict is set to malicious. Now the response would be to mitigate the threat by configuring a firewall rule.Mitigate The Threat with CatoNormally, analysts would need to jump to another platform to take action, but in the case of Cato it can all be done right in the XDR platform.

Akira ransomware attacks linked to Cisco vuln fixed in 2020,"Nearly 4-year-old Cisco vuln linked to recent Akira ransomware attacksEvidence mounts of an exploit gatekept within Russia's bordersSecurity researchers believe the Akira ransomware group could be exploiting a nearly four-year-old Cisco vulnerability and using it as an entry point into organizations' systems.In eight of security company TrueSec's most recent incident response engagements that involved Akira and Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN as the entry point, at least six of the devices were running versions vulnerable to CVE-2020-3259, which was patched in May 2020.The vulnerability lies in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software, allowing attackers to extract secrets stored in memory in clear text such as usernames and passwords – à la CitrixBleed.TrueSec said that because there is no publicly available exploit code for the Cisco vulnerability, it means cybercriminals like those working for Akira would either need to have bought that exploit from somewhere or developed one of their own, which would require a deep understanding of the flaw.Akira is long known to be targeting Cisco VPNs as the initial access vector for ransomware attacks, but the possible exploitation of the old vulnerability is the new finding here.Analysis of past cases has been stymied by the ""generally non-existent"" network logs in environments, according to Heresh Zaremand, senior consultant at TrueSec, and these were barely even enough to pinpoint AnyConnect as the point of access.In one recent incident, however, the TrueSec team managed to restore six months of radius authentication logs from an NPS server, the analysis of which revealed a pattern of malicious behavior that heavily hinted towards but didn't quite prove the use of an exploit.The researchers' observations that suggested the likely use of an exploit included:-Attackers authenticating using genuine credentials that had recently been used by the real account holder-Eight different accounts were compromised, though only two were used for lateral movement-Compromised accounts had distinct usernames that didn't follow any predictable naming conventions, and all used unique passwords-No evidence of phishing campaigns targeting the organization-No evidence of password attacks in the restored logs-No evidence of the credentials for sale on the dark webZaremand said there was no way of determining what data an attacker had accessed following an exploit, and that if they did get in, they likely exploited the device multiple times to access different parts of its memory content.""If your organization is running Cisco AnyConnect, and assuming the device has been patched since a fix for CVE-2020-3259 was available, it is highly recommended that you backtrack when your device was upgraded to a non-vulnerable version,"" he added.- Akira ransomware gang says it stole passport scans from Lush in 110 GB data heist- Cybercrooks play dress-up as 'helpful' researchers in latest ransomware ruse- Stanford schooled in cybersecurity after Akira claims ransomware attack- Ransomware fiends pounce on Cisco VPN brute-force zero-day flaw""This is important as it is not possible to determine for how long this vulnerability has been exploited. For instance, if your backtracking shows that your devices were upgraded six months ago, then it is sound to consider any username and password used for the AnyConnect SSL VPN which has not changed in the last six months as compromised.""In such cases, organizations are advised to initiate broad password resets and consider any other secrets or pre-shared keys in the device's configuration compromised.Enabling MFA is the de facto advice given to organizations following an attack, and, of course, apply the patches if you haven't already.Russia's 'prints all over it'When CVE-2020-3259 was disclosed, there were no known publicly available exploits, and that remains true to this day.The vulnerability was discovered by Russian security research outfit Positive Technologies in 2020, which was placed on the US sanctions list a year later. According to the US Treasury, Positive Technologies helped Russian intelligence (FSB) with its security services and helped run conventions the FSB used as recruitment events.Zaremand said TrueSec wasn't suggesting there are any ties between Akira and Russian intelligence, but offensive security research does appear to end up in the hands of both cybercriminals and nation states.He also pointed to the widely held belief that Akira, which recently claimed an attack on cosmetics giant Lush, is an offshoot born from Conti's demise in 2022, and that Conti itself was thought to have had ties to the FSB. ®",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

Law enforcement obtained a court order granting them permission to ""remotely disable aspects of the Chinese hacking campaign.""This criminal crew's campaign first came to light in May 2023, after Microsoft and intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes nations disclosed that Volt Typhoon had accessed networks belonging to US critical infrastructure organizations as far back as 2021.The vector is typically vulnerable Internet-facing devices — such as buggy routers, modems, security cameras and other kit — to access corporate networks. The crew uses command line tools to steal credentials and other sensitive data, and then uses those credentials to maintain persistence on the system, and the PRC-backed group upgraded their tactics, it seems.American government officials are reportedly concerned about the Chinese hackers disrupting US critical networks, including military installations, utilities, and internet service providers.

Chinese cyber agents plan to incite 'societal chaos' in US,"Congress told how Chinese goons plan to incite 'societal chaos' in the USAmerican public is way ahead of themChinese attackers are preparing to ""wreak havoc"" on American infrastructure and ""cause societal chaos"" in the US, infosec, and law enforcement bosses told a US House committee on Wednesday.""The fact that PRC hackers are targeting our critical infrastructure, water treatment plants, our electrical grid, our oil and natural gas pipelines, our transportation systems — and the risk that poses to every American requires our attention,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Select Committee on competition with China.The hearing coincided with the FBI's confirmation that it obtained search warrants and issued a remote kill command to wipe Volt Typhoon's botnet after the Chinese crew infected hundreds of end-of-life routers and attempted to break into American critical infrastructure targets.After breaking into victims' routers the Volt Typhoon crew evades detection by using legitimate IP addresses and credentials, plus other tools to communicate with their spymasters and move throughout the target environment.Such incidents are no longer a ""theoretical threat,"" added US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly, noting that CISA has seen Volt Typhoon ""burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to enabled active attacks in the event of a major crisis.""""This is a world major crisis halfway across the planet, could well endanger the lives of Americans here at home, through the disruption of our pipelines, the severing of our telecommunications, the pollution of our water facilities, the crippling of our transportation modes, all to ensure that they can incite societal panic and chaos, and to deter our ability to marshal military might and civilian will,"" she added.Earlier reports suggested that American government officials were worried that this nation-state group was biding its time and planning to disrupt military installations, utilities and internet service providers if China invaded Taiwan and the US provided support for the island nation.""Their aim is clear: In the early stages of a conflict, they want to disrupt our military's ability to mobilize, and to impact the systems that allow us to thrive in our increasingly digital world,"" said Harry Coker Jr, director of the Office of the National Cyber Director. This puts critical infrastructure owners and operators, the vast majority of whom are private organizations, ""on the front lines,"" he added.But in addition to attacking US energy grids or water systems, which would likely incite a kinetic war, China also has less overtly destructive cybertools at its disposal including disinformation, spread via TikTok and other social media, and AI capabilities such as deepfakes intending to sway US elections.These aren't easy problems to solve. As Wray has repeatedly noted — and did again in front of the House panel — Chinese cyber spies outnumber the FBI's cyber agents 50 to one.- FBI confirms it issued remote kill command to blow out Volt Typhoon's botnet- We know nations are going after critical systems, but what happens when crims join in?- Five Eyes and Microsoft accuse China of attacking US infrastructure again- US cyber spymaster calls TikTok China's 'Trojan horse'The US agency directors also told lawmakers the US needs better partnerships and threat-sharing between the private sector and the government, as well as government agencies setting clear cybersecurity requirements and providing assistance to victim organizations.In addition to these challenges, there's the ongoing cybersecurity skills shortage, which Coker said includes half a million open infosec jobs.Fixing these problems also requires holding software companies liable for buggy products, according to Easterly. This is a battle cry that Easterly repeated during her CISA tenure. The agency wants vendors to make their tech ""secure-by-design,"" so it's safe out of the box, and this responsibility isn't passed on to businesses and end users.""Unfortunately, the technology underpinning our critical infrastructure is inherently insecure because of decades of software developers not being held liable for defective technology that has led to incentives where features and speed to market have been prioritized against security, leaving our nation vulnerable to cyber invasion,"" Easterly told the House subcommittee.""Technology manufacturers must ensure that China and other cyber actors cannot exploit the weaknesses in our technology, to saunter through the open doors of our critical infrastructure to destroy it,"" she added.

Warning: New Malware Emerges in Attacks Exploiting Ivanti VPN Vulnerabilities,"Google-owned Mandiant said it identified new malware employed by a China-nexus espionage threat actor known as UNC5221 and other threat groups during post-exploitation activity targeting Ivanti Connect Secure VPN and Policy Secure devices.This includes custom web shells such as BUSHWALK, CHAINLINE, FRAMESTING, and a variant of LIGHTWIRE.""CHAINLINE is a Python web shell backdoor that is embedded in a Ivanti Connect Secure Python package that enables arbitrary command execution,"" the company said, attributing it to UNC5221, adding it also detected multiple new versions of WARPWIRE, a JavaScript-based credential stealer.The infection chains entail a successful exploitation of CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887, which allow an unauthenticated threat actor to execute arbitrary commands on the Ivanti appliance with elevated privileges.The flaws have been abused as zero-days since early December 2023. Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) said it's aware of ""multiple compromised systems"" in the country.BUSHWALK, written in Perl and deployed by circumventing the Ivanti-issued mitigations in highly-targeted attacks, is embedded into a legitimate Connect Secure file named ""querymanifest.cgi"" and offers the ability to read or write to files to a server.On the other hand, FRAMESTING is a Python web shell embedded in an Ivanti Connect Secure Python package (located in the following path ""/home/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cav-0.1-py3.6.egg/cav/api/resources/category.py"") that enables arbitrary command execution.Mandiant's analysis of the ZIPLINE passive backdoor has also uncovered its use of ""extensive functionality to ensure the authentication of its custom protocol used to establish command-and-control (C2).""Furthermore, the attacks are characterized by the use of open-source utilities like Impacket, CrackMapExec, iodine, and Enum4linux to support post-exploitation activity on Ivanti CS appliances, including network reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data exfiltration within victim environments.Ivanti has since disclosed two more security flaws, CVE-2024-21888 and CVE-2024-21893, the latter of which has come under active exploitation targeting a ""limited number of customers.""

"U.S. Feds Shut Down China-Linked ""KV-Botnet"" Targeting SOHO Routers","The U.S. government on Wednesday said it took steps to neutralize a botnet comprising hundreds of U.S.-based small office and home office (SOHO) routers hijacked by a China-linked state-sponsored threat actor called Volt Typhoon and blunt the impact posed by the hacking campaign.The existence of the botnet, dubbed KV-botnet, was first disclosed by the Black Lotus Labs team at Lumen Technologies in mid-December 2023. The law enforcement effort was reported by Reuters earlier this week.""The vast majority of routers that comprised the KV-botnet were Cisco and NetGear routers that were vulnerable because they had reached 'end of life' status; that is, they were no longer supported through their manufacturer's security patches or other software updates,"" the Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a press statement.Volt Typhoon (aka DEV-0391, Bronze Silhouette, Insidious Taurus, or Vanguard Panda) is the moniker assigned to a China-based adversarial collective that has been attributed to cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S. and Guam.""Chinese cyber actors, including a group known as 'Volt Typhoon,' are burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to be ready to launch destructive cyber attacks in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States,"" CISA Director Jen Easterly noted.The cyber espionage group, believed to be active since 2021, is known for its reliance on legitimate tools and living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to fly under the radar and persist within victim environments for extended periods of time to gather sensitive information.Another important aspect of its modus operandi is that it tries to blend into normal network activity by routing traffic through compromised SOHO network equipment, including routers, firewalls, and VPN hardware, in an attempt to obfuscate their origins.This is accomplished by means of the KV-botnet, which commandeers devices from Cisco, DrayTek, Fortinet, and NETGEAR for use as a covert data transfer network for advanced persistent threat actors. It's suspected that the botnet operators offer their services to other hacking outfits, including Volt Typhoon.In January 2024, a report from cybersecurity firm SecurityScorecard revealed how the botnet has been responsible for compromising as much as 30% — or 325 of 1,116 — of end-of-life Cisco RV320/325 routers over a 37-day period from December 1, 2023, to January 7, 2024.""Volt Typhoon is at least one user of the KV-botnet and [...] this botnet encompasses a subset of their operational infrastructure,"" Lumen Black Lotus Labs said, adding the botnet ""has been active since at least February 2022.""The company told The Hacker News that KV-botnet was operated separately, with the threat actors behind it performing their own reconnaissance and targeting, while also supporting multiple groups like Volt Typhoon.The botnet is also designed to download a virtual private network (VPN) module to the vulnerable routers and set up a direct encrypted communication channel to control the botnet and use it as an intermediary relay node to achieve their operational goals.""One function of the KV-botnet is to transmit encrypted traffic between the infected SOHO routers, allowing the hackers to anonymize their activities (i.e., the hackers appear to be operating from the SOHO routers, versus their actual computers in China),"" according to affidavits filed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).As part of its efforts to disrupt the botnet, the agency said it remotely issued commands to target routers in the U.S. using the malware's communication protocols to delete the KV-botnet payload and prevent them from being re-infected. The FBI said it also notified every victim about the operation, either directly or via their internet service provider if contact information was not available.""The court-authorized operation deleted the KV-botnet malware from the routers and took additional steps to sever their connection to the botnet, such as blocking communications with other devices used to control the botnet,"" the DoJ added.It's important to point out here that the unspecified prevention measures employed to remove the routers from the botnet are temporary and cannot survive a reboot. In other words, simply restarting the devices would render them susceptible to re-infection.""The Volt Typhoon malware enabled China to hide, among other things, pre-operational reconnaissance and network exploitation against critical infrastructure like our communications, energy, transportation, and water sectors – steps China was taking, in other words, to find and prepare to destroy or degrade the civilian critical infrastructure that keeps us safe and prosperous,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said.However, the Chinese government, in a statement shared with Reuters, denied any involvement in the attacks, dismissing it as a ""disinformation campaign"" and that it ""has been categorical in opposing hacking attacks and the abuse of information technology.""Coinciding with the takedown, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published new guidance urging SOHO device manufacturers to embrace a secure by design approach during development and shift the burden away from customers.Specifically, it's recommending that manufacturers eliminate exploitable defects in SOHO router web management interfaces and modify default device configurations to support automatic update capabilities and require a manual override to remove security settings.The compromise of edge devices such as routers for use in advanced persistent attacks mounted by Russia and China highlights a growing problem that's compounded by the fact that legacy devices no longer receive security patches and do not support endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.""The creation of products that lack appropriate security controls is unacceptable given the current threat environment,"" CISA said.

Just 29% of ransomware victims paid their attackers in Q4,"Ransomware payment rates drop to new low – now 'only 29% of victims' fork over cashIt's almost like years of false assurances have made people realize payments are pointlessTrusting a ransomware crew to honor a deal isn't the greatest idea, and the world seems to be waking up to that. It's claimed that number of victims who chose to pay dropped to a new low of 29 percent in the last quarter of 2023.The data from ransomware response and negotiation company Coveware continues a downward trend since it began monitoring in 2019, when it said the rate of companies choosing to pay ransomware actors was a whopping 85 percent. The reason for the change, Coveware founder and CEO Bill Siegel states in the company's latest quarterly report, comes down to awareness.Not only are more ransomware victims prepared for the inevitability of attacks by keeping better backups, Siegel points out, but several years of ransomware making top headlines – and associated stories of payments amounting to nothing – have led to a reluctance to trust data kidnappers.There's just no honor among thieves, it seems – even digital ones.""Q4 was rife with examples of how data assurances can fail, even when interacting with well-known 'brand established' ransomware groups,"" Siegel says. ""Threat actors cannot be trusted to prevent ongoing misuse/publication of stolen data, and … payments to them for these imaginary assurances have zero if not sub-zero value.""Along with a decrease in overall ransomware payments, Coveware found that payments for data exfiltration-only incidents also hit an all-time low since it began tracking them in 2022. While 53 percent of companies were paying such demands two years ago, only 26 percent did so in the fourth quarter of 2023.Further proof a ransomware payment ban is a bad moveCoveware's takeaway is that the world is making progress in dealing with ransomware that a payment ban would completely undo.""A ban would signal that as a country, we are admitting that we are incapable of defending ourselves,"" Siegel states. He adds that early experiments with payment bans have been largely ineffective. The report cites a Florida ban on ransomware payments that took effect on July 1, 2022, noting that ""we have not yet seen a decline in attacks inside [Florida and other] states"" that have enacted a payment ban, like North Carolina.- US officials close to persuading allies to not pay off ransomware crooks- Ransomware payment ban: Wrong idea at the wrong time- Formal ban on ransomware payments? Asking orgs nicely to not cough up ain't working- Be honest. Would you pay off a ransomware crew?Instead, Siegel offered reporting requirements, like those enacted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, as a major reason for the progress. If a nationwide payment ban were enacted, that progress would be unpicked, the report argues.""There would still be demand for ransom payment services because people and organizations will do what they must to survive,"" says Siegel. Enact a payment ban, and compliance with reporting rules may decrease as companies make payments through offshore accounts and ""re-order the flow of money through a new illegal market of service providers.""Like ransomware criminals themselves, illegal service providers could easily take the money and run.Safe harbors, encouraging companies to work with law enforcement, and more awareness of how to stay safe is the key, Coveware insists.""Greater costs must be imposed on the threat actors by changing the incentives of the victims,"" Siegel says in the report.

Earlier Tuesday, news broke that the FBI had obtained a court order to remotely disable parts of the PRC-backed crew's cyber campaign.""We've been involved in incident response cases, as well as using our intelligence and capabilities to track that group and identify where they've been targeting,"" Lee said.These targets, he added are ""very strategic sites, the types of sites you'd really want to go after in conflict, focusing on US energy systems, as well as US satellite and telecommunication networks.""Volt Typhoon ""consistently chooses industrial targets, goes after those targets, and plays this low and slow game,"" Lee said.This particular espionage gang, he added, has the resources and the technical capabilities to develop ""Pipedream-like capabilities.""Pipedream, an industrial control system (ICS) specific malware that Dragos uncovered in April 2022 after spotting it in an unnamed organization's OT environment. Mandiant calls this set of ICS attack tools ""Incontroller,"" and notes that it is ""consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS.""The malware doesn't exploit a particular vulnerability in these systems, but rather allows the operators to interact with a variety of industrial equipment from multiple vendors, and then disrupt or even physically destroy critical devices.Shortly after the threat hunters sounded the alarm on this new nation-state cyber weapon, several US government agencies (CISA, NSA, FBI and Department of Energy) warned that programmable logic controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron Electronics, Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture servers and other devices were at risk.To date, Drgos does not believe Pipedream has been used in a critical infrastructure attack, Lee said.""It was the thing they were ready to use when they were ready to go to armed conflict,"" he said. ""That capability allows you to interact with industrial networks and environments to cause physical destruction. And it works on all the different industries from a water system to a carbon cracker to a servomotor on an unmanned aerial vehicle.""- US shorts China's Volt Typhoon crew targeting America's criticals- Five Eyes and Microsoft accuse China of attacking US infrastructure again- CISA and friends raise alarm on critical flaws in industrial equipment, infrastructure- Threat group builds custom malware to attack industrial systemsThe malware ""takes advantage of native functionality"" inside of industrial environments, meaning that it can't be fixed by patching a hole or updating the software or firmware, Lee added.This means the threat still exists.""What concerns me is other countries are working on very similar capabilities,"" Lee said. ""And these capabilities are going to start proliferating to criminals.""Presumably countries like Russia and China would wait and use these types of destructive attacks against critical systems during times or war. The Volt Typhoon campaign, for example, could allow China to disrupt US military operations in the Indo-Pacific region in the case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, according to some national security sources.However, once profit-motivated criminal gangs get ahold of these types of tools, Lee said he expects these destructive attacks to become more commonplace. He pointed to the rise in popularity of Cobalt Strike and other legitimate offensive security tools among ransomware gangs to prove this point.""Criminal actors no longer needed to develop their own capabilities, malicious software vulnerabilities, etc.,"" Lee said. ""They literally buy off-the shelf tools that are commonly used, and then just worry about operating them.""When Cobalt Strike became available, ""you saw massive amounts of criminal groups spin up overnight being able to leverage it.

"FTC to Blackbaud: We're not gonna fine you, but do better","Blackbaud settles with FTC after that IT breach exposed millions of people's infoCloud software slinger admits no guilt, promises better basic security hygieneBlackbaud, which had data on millions of people stolen from it by one or more crooks, has promised to shore up its IT defenses in a proposed deal with the FTC.In announcing the draft settlement, the US watchdog's boss Lina Khan, Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, and Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya blasted Blackbaud – a cloud software provider for schools, charities, and other orgs – for its ""unfair and deceptive data security practices"" in a statement [PDF].""The FTC charges that Blackbaud's reckless data retention practices rendered its security failures much more costly: by hoarding reams of data that it did not reasonably need, Blackbaud's breach exposed far more data,"" they said.""Moreover, Blackbaud's notification alerting victims of the breach included false statements, which Blackbaud did not correct until months later — and months after it knew the statements were false.""Back in February 2020, according to a formal complaint [PDF] raised by the FTC, criminals broke into Blackbaud's databases, remained undetected for three months, and stole files on about 13,000 of the biz's customers. Those files contained ""the personal information of millions of consumers,"" the regulator saidAfter being detected, the intruders extorted the software maker, and Blackbaud allegedly agreed to pay the miscreants about $235,000 to quietly go away and delete any pilfered documents, according to the FTC complaint. However, Blackbaud wasn't able to verify that the crims really did scrap the swiped data.Then, in June 2020, the biz finally got around to alerting its customers about the privacy breach. At the time it assured them: ""The cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers.""This turned out to be false, we're told. According to the FTC, Blackbaud knew as early as July 31, 2020, ""that the attacker had exfiltrated consumers' bank account numbers and social security numbers."" The business didn't, however, disclose that to customers until October 2020.- Cloud biz Blackbaud caved to ransomware gang's demands – then neglected to inform customers for two months- 'We stopped ransomware' boasts Blackbaud CEO.

That's supposed to reduce the risk of personal data being stolen in future.Blackbaud also agreed to publicize its updated data retention policy, outlining what specific customer info it maintains, why the outfit has it, and give a solid timeframe for deleting these files.Plus, the firm has to put into place an overhauled infosec program that includes, among other things, multi-factor authentication; data loss tools; penetration testing; and encryption of, at a minimum, customers' Social Security numbers, passport numbers, tax IDs, driving licenses and other government-issued identification, plus bank account, credit card, and debit card information, dates of birth, medical information, and user account credentials.That last part is important because, according to the watchdog, Blackbaud's failure to encrypt sensitive data, plus holding onto this information for far longer than was necessary, made the security breach far worse than it would have been otherwise.A Blackbaud spokesperson told The Register the company neither admits nor denies any of the FTC's allegations in its proposed settlement, which is awaiting final sign-off from the regulator.""We are pleased to resolve this matter with the FTC,"" said Mike Gianoni, president and CEO, Blackbaud.

"FritzFrog Returns with Log4Shell and PwnKit, Spreading Malware Inside Your Network","The threat actor behind a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet known as FritzFrog has made a return with a new variant that leverages the Log4Shell vulnerability to propagate internally within an already compromised network.""The vulnerability is exploited in a brute-force manner that attempts to target as many vulnerable Java applications as possible,"" web infrastructure and security company Akamai said in a report shared with The Hacker News.FritzFrog, first documented by Guardicore (now part of Akamai) in August 2020, is a Golang-based malware that primarily targets internet-facing servers with weak SSH credentials. It's known to be active since January 2020.It has since evolved to strike healthcare, education, and government sectors as well as improved its capabilities to ultimately deploy cryptocurrency miners on infected hosts, claiming more than 1,500 victims over the years.What's novel about the latest version is the use of the Log4Shell vulnerability as a secondary infection vector to specifically single out internal hosts rather than targeting vulnerable publicly-accessible assets. Akamai is tracking the activity under the name Frog4Shell.""When the vulnerability was first discovered, internet-facing applications were prioritized for patching because of their significant risk of compromise,"" security researcher Ori David said.""Contrastly, internal machines, which were less likely to be exploited, were often neglected and remained unpatched — a circumstance that FritzFrog takes advantage of.""This means that even if the internet-facing applications have been patched, a breach of any other endpoint can expose unpatched internal systems to exploitation and help propagate the malware.The SSH brute-force component of FritzFrog has also received a facelift of its own to identify specific SSH targets by enumerating several system logs on each of its victims.Another notable change in the malware is use of the PwnKit flaw tracked as CVE-2021-4034 to achieve local privilege escalation.""FritzFrog continues to employ tactics to remain hidden and avoid detection,"" David said. ""In particular, it takes special care to avoid dropping files to disk when possible.""This is accomplished by means of the shared memory location /dev/shm, which has also been put to use by other Linux-based malware such as BPFDoor and Commando Cat, and memfd_create to execute memory-resident payloads.The disclosure comes as Akamai revealed that the InfectedSlurs botnet is actively exploiting now-patched security flaws (from CVE-2024-22768 through CVE-2024-22772, and CVE-2024-23842) impacting multiple DVR device models from Hitron Systems to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

It was other crims what did it: SBF off hook for FTX hack,"SBF likely off the hook for misplaced FTX funds after cops bust SIM swap ringPLUS: more glibc vulns discovered; DraftKings hacker sentenced; and a hefty dose of critical vulnerabilitiesInfosec In Brief The recent indictment of a massive SIM-swapping ring may mean convicted crypto conman Sam Bankman-Fried is innocent of at least one allegation still hanging over his head: The theft of more than $400 million in crypto hacked from wallets belonging to his crypto firm, FTX, just before it declared bankruptcy.As reported earlier this week, a trio of individuals, led by Chicago resident Robert Powell, were indicted [PDF] on charges of committing SIM swapping attacks on over 50 victims in 13 US states from 2021 until 2023, stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.The trio's biggest haul was the theft of more than $400 million in cryptocurrency from an unnamed ""Victim Company-1"" on November 11, 2022 – the same day that FTX declared bankruptcy and an unknown attacker stole roughly $415m in crypto from the firm.Brian Krebs was the first to make the connection between the indictment of the Powell gang and the FTX theft, and blockchain analytics firm Elliptic backed him up, noting ""we are not aware of any other thefts from crypto businesses on this scale, on these dates.""""It therefore appears likely that FTX is the 'Victim Company-1' named in the indictment,"" Elliptic concluded, while admitting that it's not clear if Powell and his co-conspirators stole the money themselves, or facilitated the theft on behalf of another party.Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources familiar with the case, said it's received confirmation that Victim Company-1 is, indeed, FTX.Powell was reportedly arrested in Chicago last week and is being held without bond pending transfer to Washington, DC to face charges. His co-conspirators, Carter Rohn of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Emily Hernandez of Colorado Springs, Colorado, have also been apprehended.While SBF might be off the hook for this element of his mismanagement of FTX, that won’t help him to walk free as was convicted on seven charges in October 2023 and faces up to 110 years in prison when sentenced next month.Critical vulnerabilities: Apple Vision Pro gets pre-release patchIt's been a busy week in vulnerability land, with Apple patching security holes in its Vision Pro headset before it even hit the market.This isn't a new vulnerability – it's the same WebKit vuln we reported last week that appeared across Apple OSes and has already been patched.

Cloudflare publishes details of Thanksgiving security breach,"Cloudflare sheds more light on Thanksgiving security breach in which tokens, source code accessed by suspected spiesAtlassian systen compromised via October Okta intrusionCloudflare has just detailed how suspected government spies gained access to its internal Atlassian installation using credentials stolen via a security breach at Okta in October.In a write-up on Thursday, CEO Matthew Prince, CTO John Graham-Cumming, and CISO Grant Bourzikas said the Atlassian intrusion was detected all the way back on Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 2023, and that the trespassers were ejected the following day.The October Okta security breach involved more than 130 customers of that IT access management biz, in which snoops swiped data from Okta in hope of drilling further into those organizations. Cloudflare was among those affected, as it was in 2022 as a result of a separate Okta intrusion.Cloudflare acknowledged in October it was caught up in Okta's latest security meltdown, and is now disclosing more details about what happened.The intruders – likely agents of a nation state, according to Prince et al – obtained one service token and three service account credentials through that 2023 Okta compromise. At the time, Okta indicated that information stolen from its customer support systems was pretty benign, and could be used in things like phishing or social engineering attacks. It turns out that session tokens, granting access into networks of the likes of Cloudflare, were taken from Okta's systems.""One was a Moveworks service token that granted remote access into our Atlassian system,"" said Prince, Graham-Cumming, and Bourzikas on that note.""The second credential was a service account used by the SaaS-based Smartsheet application that had administrative access to our Atlassian Jira instance, the third account was a Bitbucket service account which was used to access our source code management system, and the fourth was an AWS environment that had no access to the global network and no customer or sensitive data.""Because Cloudflare incorrectly believed those tokens were unused, it failed to rotate them. So the thief or thieves were able to use them to gain access to Cloudflare's systems.- Okta data breach dilemma dwarfs earlier estimates- Okta October breach affected 134 orgs, biz admits- Cloudflare exiles baseboard management controller from its server motherboards- Cloudflare defends firing of staffer for reasons HR could not explainFrom November 14, 2023 through November 17, 2023, the intruders appear to have been probing Cloudflare's systems, doing reconnaissance through its Confluence-based internal wiki, and its Jira bug database.Further accesses were detected on November 20 and 21, following by the establishment of a persistence presence in the cloud corp's Atlassasian server via ScriptRunner for Jira. Having administrative access to Jira via the Smartsheet service, the snoops were able to install the Sliver Adversary Emulation Framework, a common tool for command-and-control connectivity and backdoor access.The intruders also gained access to Cloudflare's Bitbucket source code management system, but efforts to access a console server linked to a not-yet-active datacenter in São Paulo, Brazil failed.The intruders, according to the cloud giant, scoured the biz's wiki for information about remote access, secrets, and tokens. Also of interest were 36 Jira tickets, out of more than two million, that focused on vulnerability management, secret rotation, multi-factor authentication bypass, network access, and even the biz's response to the Okta incident.This attack was performed by a nation-state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflare’s global networkThe spies' interest in secrets was also evident in the 120 Bitbucket code repositories viewed out of a total of almost 12,000. Some 76 of the 120 were downloaded to the Atlassian server. While Cloudflare is uncertain whether these were exfiltrated, it's treating them as such. These repos were mostly related to the way backups work, global network configuration and management, identity, remote access, and Terraform and Kubernetes. A few contained encrypted secrets and those were immediately rotated even though they were strongly encrypted, according to the US CDN giant.""Even though we understand the operational impact of the incident to be extremely limited, we took this incident very seriously because a threat actor had used stolen credentials to get access to our Atlassian server and accessed some documentation and a limited amount of source code,"" said Prince et al.""Based on our collaboration with colleagues in the industry and government, we believe that this attack was performed by a nation-state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflare’s global network.""Cloudflare managed to expel the attackers by November 24, 2023, and set about assessing the damage and investigating what happened. Three days later, a company-wide remediation effort dubbed ""Code Red"" became the focus of much of its technical staff. And this project was assisted by external security firm Crowdstrike, which carried out an independent assessment of the cyber-assault.Code Red concluded on January 5, 2024, but according to Prince, Graham-Cumming, and Bourzikas ""work continues across the company around credential management, software hardening, vulnerability management, additional alerting, and more."" ®",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Feds cough up 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals,"Ignore Uncle Sam's 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your perilWhat is on HHS paper will most likely become law, Google security boss saysInterview If you are responsible for infosec at an American hospital or other healthcare organization, and you treat the US government's new ""voluntary"" cybersecurity performance goals (CPGs) as, well, voluntary, you're ignoring the writing on the wall.Plus, you're going to be in for a world of hurt when new regulations – which will very likely mirror these voluntary practices – take effect, according to Taylor Lehmann, a director in Google Cloud's Office of the Chief Information Security Officer.""The benefit of the CPG is that it indicates where the ball is bouncing next, and what the standards and expectations are for what organizations should be working on,"" Lehmann told The Register.Lehmann, a former CISO of Athenahealth and Tufts Medicine, said the proof is in previous federal agency rulemaking processes.""It may not be today, but what is on HHS paper will most likely become what is in the actual final rulemaking or new regulatory requirements that become law,"" he said. ""If you buy into the fact that voluntary doesn't mean you have to do something, you are probably going to be wrong. Voluntary goals become mandatory, and that has usually been the case with other rulemaking in healthcare as it relates to security.""In early January, as a record-breaking 46 health networks with a total of 141 hospitals between them were still reeling from ransomware infections and data theft in 2023, rumors started swirling that the White House would soon require US hospitals to meet basic cybersecurity standards before receiving federal funding.During all of this, the criminals behind the intrusions were using their own increasingly dangerous extorion methods to force hospitals to pay ransom demands.When asked about the hospital rules, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services directed The Register to a concept paper published in December that outlines the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) cybersecurity strategy.According to the paper [PDF], officials will propose new, enforceable security standards, and will work with Congress to administer financial support and incentives for hospitals to implement ""high-impact cybersecurity practices,"" among other actions.Later in January, HHS released the voluntary, healthcare-specific CPGs.Essential doesn't mean easyThese goals are divided into two categories, essential and enhanced, and each has ten specific things that organizations can do to better protect themselves from cyberattacks.The essential goals sound like base-level security – the kind of things one would hope that hospitals and clinics already have in place.But, according to Lehmann, they are all based on real-world exploits and compromises. ""Basically what the sector experienced over the last year,"" he said. ""I'd love to say these are super obvious, but clearly they are not all being done.""They include mitigating known vulnerabilities, using multi-factor authentication, implementing email security, training employees in secure behaviors, encrypting sensitive data, and revoking credentials for employees, contractors, and volunteers when they leave the organization.Basic incident response planning, using unique credentials, separating user and privileged accounts, and assessing vendor and supplier risks round out the essential goals.""The point is, basics aren't always necessarily easy. The basics can be super hard,"" Lehmann said.- Uncle Sam tells hospitals: Meet security standards or no federal dollars for you- LockBit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children's hospital- 'Exemplar' digital hospitals trust hit by multiple tech-related traumas- After injecting cancer hospital with ransomware, crims threaten to swat patientsHealthcare networks, especially those with clinics and hospitals in smaller, rural communities, aren't running modern technology stacks. Some of their equipment is decades old, and they can't afford to upgrade it or hire enough employees to support their security goals.""The tech debt has stacked up for years, and to overcome it, in many cases, will put organizations out of business,"" Lehmann said. ""It happened this summer.""He's referring to an Illinois hospital that said it would shut down in part because of a ransomware infection.This isn't to say large hospitals are immune from ransomware or other cyberattacks. Case in point: CommonSpirit Health, America's second-largest nonprofit healthcare org, diverted ambulances and shut down electronic record systems at its facilities and hospitals across 21 states.""We're going to keep struggling – that is, until the point where HHS steps in, which is what they have alluded to doing,"" Lehmann said.Still, implementing even the essential goals like multi-factor authentication, for example, can present difficulties.""How are you going to get 15,000 people to do two-factor authentication enrollment in a window of time? And with appropriate resourcing, to make sure if a catastrophic event occurs and we're in the middle of a two-factor enrollment, that we don't have to shut the hospital down? If these things aren't done well, they can have catastrophic operational impacts on really sensitive life-saving things,"" Lehmann said.Another of the essential goals – revoking credentials when people leave the organization – isn't as easy as it sounds either.""Not if you're an academic medical system where you've got five or more academic institutions, and you don't know when those students graduate, you don't know when they leave,"" Lehmann said.He added that the essential goals do ""miss the point"" a bit by focusing primarily on preventing attacks, instead of equally prioritizing resilience and recovery. For too long, data confidentiality, and protecting patient's PII and health information, has been seen as the only goal in securing healthcare because failing to protect confidential information is what gets hospitals in trouble with government agencies.""Availability is equally important, if not more important, than confidentiality,"" Lehmann said, adding that many healthcare orgs haven't yet progressed to this way of thinking about security.

Cloudflare Breach: Nation-State Hackers Access Source Code and Internal Docs,"Cloudflare has revealed that it was the target of a likely nation-state attack in which the threat actor leveraged stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to its Atlassian server and ultimately access some documentation and a limited amount of source code.The intrusion, which took place between November 14 and 24, 2023, and detected on November 23, was carried out ""with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflare's global network,"" the web infrastructure company said, describing the actor as ""sophisticated"" and one who ""operated in a thoughtful and methodical manner.""As a precautionary measure, the company further said it rotated more than 5,000 production credentials, physically segmented test and staging systems, carried out forensic triages on 4,893 systems, reimaged and rebooted every machine across its global network.The incident involved a four-day reconnaissance period to access Atlassian Confluence and Jira portals, following which the adversary created a rogue Atlassian user account and established persistent access to its Atlassian server to ultimately obtain access to the Bitbucket source code management system by means of the Sliver adversary simulation framework.As many as 120 code repositories were viewed, out of which 76 are estimated to have been exfiltrated by the attacker.""The 76 source code repositories were almost all related to how backups work, how the global network is configured and managed, how identity works at Cloudflare, remote access, and our use of Terraform and Kubernetes,"" Cloudflare said.""A small number of the repositories contained encrypted secrets which were rotated immediately even though they were strongly encrypted themselves.""The threat actor is then said to have unsuccessfully attempted to ""access a console server that had access to the data center that Cloudflare had not yet put into production in São Paulo, Brazil.""The attack was made possible by using one access token and three service account credentials associated with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Atlassian Bitbucket, Moveworks, and Smartsheet that were stolen following the October 2023 hack of Okta's support case management system.Cloudflare acknowledged that it had failed to rotate these credentials, mistakenly assuming they were unused.The company also said it took steps to terminate all malicious connections originating from the threat actor on November 24, 2023. It also involved cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to perform an independent assessment of the incident.""The only production systems the threat actor could access using the stolen credentials was our Atlassian environment.

Ivanti releases patches for old and new VPN zero-days,"Ivanti releases patches for VPN zero-days, discloses two more high-severity vulnsMany versions still without fixes while sophisticated attackers bypass mitigationsIvanti has finally released the first round of patches for vulnerability-stricken Connect Secure and Policy Secure gateways, but in doing so has also found two additional zero-days, one of which is under active exploitation.The news comes days after Ivanti, which releases its patches on a staggered schedule, said the first batch of fixes – due last week – was delayed, and many versions remain without official fixes.Patches are now available for versions 9.1R14.4, 9.1R17.2, 9.1R18.3, 22.4R2.2, 22.5R1.1, and ZTA version 22.6R1.3, which will be welcome news to admins fearful of becoming the next target among a growing number of victims.Admins are advised ""out of an abundance of caution"" to also factory-reset their devices before applying the patch. This is to prevent any possibility of an attacker gaining upgrade persistence. Ivanti said the process will take up to four hours to complete.Given the state of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, it goes without saying that these patches should be applied as soon as possible.To recap, earlier this month security researchers at Volexity disclosed the two-bug zero-day exploit they believed to be carried out by an unknown group with a suspected China nexus. The researchers said the vulnerabilities make it ""trivial"" for remote unauthenticated attackers to achieve code execution.At the time, Ivanti said fewer than ten victims were believed to have been breached but this quickly increased and was under mass exploitation within days.Ivanti also said it would develop patches not by version order, but according to the version with the most installs. Patches were expected to drop between January 22 and February 19, but some of these have since been delayed slightly.Customers in the meantime were advised to apply the mitigation available via the Ivanti download portal and use the external version of Ivanti's internal integrity checker (ICT), alongside proactive threat-hunting practices to monitor for suspected compromises.To make matters worse, this week the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said Ivanti's mitigation was bypassed by some sophisticated attackers.""Threat actors are continuing to leverage vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways to capture credentials and/or drop webshells that enable further compromise of enterprise networks,"" the alert reads.""Some threat actors have recently developed workarounds to current mitigations and detection methods and have been able to exploit weaknesses, move laterally, and escalate privileges without detection. CISA is aware of instances in which sophisticated threat actors have subverted the external ICT, further minimizing traces of their intrusion.""CISA suggests organizations should continue to proactively hunt for threats to systems connected to vulnerable Ivanti devices. It also advised monitoring account authentication, usage, and identity management services that could be exposed, isolating them from enterprise resources where possible.In releasing today's round of patches, Ivanti also updated its mitigation in a bid to keep attackers at bay for now. This can be applied via the download portal like the last one.- US shorts China's Volt Typhoon crew targeting America's criticals- Ivanti and Juniper Networks accused of bending the rules with CVE assignments- BreachForums admin 'Pompourin' sentenced to 20 years of supervised release- Russians invade Microsoft exec mail while China jabs at VMware vCenter ServerThe vendor didn't mention any changes being made to the external ICT, however, despite current intelligence indicating attackers can get around its detection capabilities.More zero-days?That mitigation will also apply to the two additional zero-days announced today which affect all supported versions of Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA gateways.""Upon learning of these vulnerabilities, we immediately mobilized resources and the patch is available now via the standard download portal for Ivanti Connect Secure,"" said Ivanti in an advisory.""It is critical that you immediately take action to ensure you are fully protected.""Tracked as CVE-2024-21888 and CVE-2024-21893, they both carry high-severity CVSS scores. Ivanti's descriptions for both are:-CVE-2024-21888: A privilege escalation vulnerability in web component of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x) allows a user to elevate privileges to that of an administrator-CVE-2024-21893: A server-side request forgery vulnerability in the SAML component of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA allows an attacker to access certain restricted resources without authenticationIvanti said there is no evidence to suggest that CVE-2024-21888 is under active exploitation, but a small number of customers have been hit by the server-side request forgery flaw.It's not clear if the discovery of these two additional vulnerabilities was the cause of the overall delay in the patch schedule. The Register has asked Ivanti to comment.A spokesperson at Ivanti sent a statement:""The security of our customers is our top priority. As part of our ongoing investigation, we discovered two additional vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure. We included a fix for these vulnerabilities and previously identified vulnerabilities in the patch released today, and patches planned for release for additional versions will also include a comprehensive fix. And the patches released on January 31 cover the majority of our customers. We have also provided a new mitigation in the best interest of customers while the remaining patch versions are in development.""We strongly encourage customers to apply the patch for their version as it becomes available. While additional patch versions are in development, they should apply the mitigation and run the internal and external ICT."" ®",security updates and patches,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Managing the hidden risks of shadow APIs,"How F5 Distributed Cloud Services seal security gaps in modern app development amid growing attack surfacePartner Content Application programming interfaces (APIs) play a significant role in today's digital economy, but at the same time they can also represent a data security vulnerability.While APIs serve as building blocks to modern app development, their proliferation and sprawl have also been exploited by bad actors targeting web apps to initiate data breaches, account takeover, fraud and other threats.API endpoints increase an application's attack surface area and introduce vulnerabilities and compliance issues that traditional app security tools struggle to mitigate. Compounding the problem are the countless outdated or undocumented APIs, dubbed shadow APIs, that connect to applications which organizations have long forgotten or hardly ever use. Many of these were built to facilitate internal tests or work around various limitations in a bid to speed up the integration of multiple, disparate systems. But without proper management, continuous monitoring, and security controls, they have also introduced persistent risks in real-world deployments and operations.A discussion at an F5-Google webinar this year explored the difficulty involved in ascertaining whether performance issues and other disruptions occurring in systems and applications were signs that API sprawl was a contributing factor to cyber attacks. What we do know is that organizations commonly struggle with visibility into the state of API security. Security, governance, and efficiency challenges are further compounded by the increased adoption of hybrid cloud infrastructure and microservices. Multi-cloud complexity and multi-app business processes make enforcing consistent security difficult, and vulnerabilities that exist within APIs deployed or integrated into larger applications are hard to mitigate and even harder to remediate.Key ways to manage shadow APIs entail API documentation and inventory, API Discovery, API validation, and comprehensive visibility into the security of API endpoints.API documentation and inventoryThe F5 Distributed Cloud API Security solution is built to provide deep insights with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to identify shadow APIs, block API attacks in real time, and eliminate vulnerabilities at their source.This requires a solid process for publishing APIs with proper documentation which records how the API behaves and how it interacts with other APIs. This approach solves the problem of app developers deploying public APIs, bypassing internally mandated security processes and procedures, and pushing them into production without proper documentation.With F5 Distributed Cloud Web App and API Protection, security teams can build a comprehensive inventory of all known APIs, their endpoints and expected operations. Since APIs change frequently, the process runs periodically to ensure that the API inventory is up to date.API discovery and validationAPI discovery and validation are complemented by two other fundamental elements of API security – authentication and authorization. Authentication verifies the identity of users or systems trying to access an API based on username/password, API keys, tokens and biometrics. Authorization limits the actions an authenticated user or system is allowed to perform within the API through access control rules, roles and permissions.The F5 Distributed Cloud Platform automatically discovers API endpoints mapped to applications, blocks unwanted connections and suspicious requests, and monitors for anomalous behavior or shadow APIs to prevent data leakage. To prevent injection attacks and other exploits, input validation rules define what is considered valid data. This process ensures that the data received from external sources, such as user inputs or APIs, are safe, reliable and free from malicious content.Comprehensive visibilityIn today's dynamic API landscape, maintaining comprehensive visibility into the security posture of API endpoints is paramount.All critical app and API security controls necessary to protect an app's entire ecosystem can be deployed and managed through the unified API security console of the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform. This allows DevOps and SecOps teams to observe and quickly identify suspected API abuse as anomalies are detected as well as create policies to stop misuse.This requires the use of ML models to create baselines of normal API usage patterns. Continuous ML-based traffic monitoring allows API security to predict and block suspicious activity over time. Deviations from these baselines and other anomalies trigger alerts or automated responses to detect outliers, including rogue and shadow APIs.Dashboards play a crucial role in providing the visibility required to monitor and assess the security of APIs. The F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP platform extends beyond basic API inventory management by presenting essential security information based on actual and attack traffic. Specifically, the API Endpoints Dashboard presents the Top Attacked APIs by percentage of attacks, Top Sensitive Data types found, Total API calls broken down by response code, and Most Active APIs.Critical information – such as discovered sensitive data types, threat levels determined by attack traffic, authentication status, API category and the API's risk score – enables DevOps and SecOps teams to quickly identify potential vulnerabilities, prioritize remediation efforts, and make informed decisions to strengthen the security posture of the APIs.Intelligent risk mitigationThe SaaS-based F5 Distributed Cloud Platform enables users to manage and tap on threat analytics, forensics, and troubleshooting of API communications in modern applications.AI is used to identify complex attack patterns and zero-day vulnerabilities that traditional rule-based systems cannot detect. Methods such as behavioral analytics to detect suspicious behavior may indicate potential threats from malicious users while risk-based controls step up the authentication process, making it more stringent with any increase in perceived threat level.The F5 solution scans and tests APIs in a runtime environment to uncover vulnerabilities in APIs before they are in production, where remediation is more costly and frustrating. It detects and blocks attacks listed in the OWASP API Top 10 in real time at the development and production layer.Ultimately the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform is designed to enable unified management of infrastructure and workloads across multiple compute environments for flexible deployment, secure app-to-app interconnection, and consistent policy enforcement across cloud, data center and edge as well as the application lifecycle.This approach to API security heralds something of a shift in the common risk management approach, especially with the rise of shadow APIs. Enterprising and innovative organizations now have the power to correlate data insights at scale through comprehensive cross-platform visibility and the intense power of AI and ML.This article was contributed by F5.",marketing,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
LockBit remorseless in latest children's hospital attack,"LockBit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children's hospitalIt even had the gall to set the ransom demand at $800K … for a nonprofitRansomware gang LockBit is claiming responsibility for an attack on a Chicago children's hospital in an apparent deviation from its previous policy of not targeting nonprofits.Stooping to new lows, the criminals are reportedly unwilling to reverse the attack on Saint Anthony Hospital, as they had done in previous cases such as Toronto's SickKids hospital.What's more, it apparently thinks a nonprofit hospital has the funds to pay a $800,000 ransom. Saint Anthony Hospital has not explicitly stated whether it will or won't pay, but with a sum this large it's highly unlikely that it would ever consider paying, let alone have the funds available to do so.The deadline for payment has been set at 01:41 UTC on February 2. A $1,000 payment would extend the timer for 24 hours, and $800,000 is the price assigned to the data – that goes for both the destruction of it or the purchase of it by other parties.Saint Anthony Hospital confirmed the attack via a statement published this week, saying files containing patient information had been copied by an unknown attacker. The hospital didn't specify the nature of the stolen data but confirmed no medical or financial records were accessed.LockBit's intrusion began on December 18 but the hospital's internal investigation didn't conclude patient data was compromised until January 7. In the meantime, it said it took immediate action to secure its network and ensure patient care remained uninterrupted.""Saint Anthony holds cybersecurity and the privacy of patient information in its care as top priorities,"" it said [PDF]. ""Our prompt response to this event allowed us to continue providing patient care without disruption.""As part of Saint Anthony's ongoing commitment to data privacy, we are working to review existing policies and procedures and implement additional ones as needed. Saint Anthony promptly reported this incident to the FBI and is cooperating with their investigation. We also reported this incident to appropriate regulators, including the US Department of Health and Human Services.""As the review of the incident progresses, the hospital said it would notify those it believes are impacted by the data theft. Until then, all patients are advised to remain vigilant to identity or financial fraud attempts and sign up for a free year of credit monitoring.LockBit had in some previous cases shown a degree of restraint when targeting the likes of hospitals and other nonprofits, yet appears to be loosening the shackles on its affiliates, allowing them to target any organization they're able to breach.In response to an affiliate that attacked Toronto's SickKids hospital last year, LockBit formally apologized, issued a free decryptor, and supposedly booted that affiliate out of its program for violating the rules.In a post to its leak blog this week, LockBit said: ""Always US hospitals put their greedy interest over those of their patients and clients.""We've been unable to get in touch with the spokesperson for the gang to ask about the attack and shift in approach, but the malware collectors at vx-underground were under the impression that LockBit was either ignorant to the fact Saint Anthony was a nonprofit, or simply didn't care.Asked about the reasons for the attack, the gang reportedly responded by sending the hospital's financial disclosures, suggesting it either thought it was indeed a corporate entity or confused the meaning of ""nonprofit"" for an organization that generates zero revenue.- EquiLend drags systems offline after admitting attacker broke in- Subway's data torpedoed by LockBit, ransomware gang claims- Freight giant Estes refuses to deliver ransom, says personal data opened and stolen- FBI develops decryptor for BlackCat ransomware, seizes gang's websiteSaint Anthony's website clearly states that it's ""an independent, nonprofit, faith-based, acute care, community hospital."" So the decision to press ahead with the attack appears to be nothing more than a senseless money grab.""If you attempt to educate and present information to LockBit administrative staff on nonprofit institution laws in the United States they will state the organization is corrupt and they will imply (directly or indirectly) it is a money laundering operation and the facility is dirty and deserves to be ransomed,"" said vx-underground.""In summary: the rules are a facade.""Similar ignorance was demonstrated by LockBit leadership in attacks on the education sector, flippantly responding by saying: ""If they have money for computers, they have money to pay me.""Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET, said that cybercriminals will always pursue attacks that align with their business goals.""Although ransomware gangs may have chosen to avoid organizations such as hospitals and not-for-profits in the past, business is business and criminal goals are no different.""The evolution of cybersecurity over the last decade has proved that criminal gangs have also had to pivot in terms of how they attack and financially conquer. Ransomware has become a different beast where data has become even more of the focal point in the way it has become a weapon of extortion rather than just relying on an encryption attack followed by ransom demands.""No one remains safe from these attacks whether they are targeted or caught up in larger campaigns. Companies should never believe they are foolproof due to the nature of their business, nor should they reduce the best possible protection they have to offer."" ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Ivanti devices hit by exploits for yet another security hole,"Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security holeAt this point you might be better off just shutting the stuff downVarious miscreants are attempting to exploit the latest Ivanti flaw, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-21893 that can be used to hijack equipment.That's according to threat hunters tracking the string of CVE-listed security holes plaguing the VPN gateways in recent weeks.Ivanti on January 31 disclosed and began patching CVE-2024-21893, which is present in the SAML component of of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x) appliances. The vendor spotted the flaw as it was investigating and scrambling to patch two other zero-day bugs in those products: an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2023-46805), and a common injection flaw (CVE-2024-21887), both of which are also under attack.Crooks latched onto CVE-2024-21893 because the vulnerability can be used to bypass mitigation efforts for those pair of earlier flaws and gain control of network gateways.""At the time of publication, the exploitation of CVE-2024-21893 appears to be targeted,"" Ivanti claimed last week, adding that it expected exploitation to ramp up sharply as word of the security hole spread.""The SSRF can be chained to CVE-2024-21887 for unauthenticated command injection with root privileges,"" Rapid7 principal security researcher Stephen Fewer added on February 2.The security shop also published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for CVE-2024-21893 that same day.And unsurprisingly, the infosec watchers at ShadowServer observed attempts to open backdoors on vulnerable equipment and other exploitation attempts by snoops. ""To date, over 170 attacking IPs involved,"" according to the org, which noted it did spot exploitation prior to the Rapid7 PoC.When asked about the attacks this month, an Ivanti spokesperson directed The Register to its earlier security alert.

Why the Right Metrics Matter When it Comes to Vulnerability Management,"How's your vulnerability management program doing? Is it effective? A success? Let's be honest, without the right metrics or analytics, how can you tell how well you're doing, progressing, or if you're getting ROI? If you're not measuring, how do you know it's working?And even if you are measuring, faulty reporting or focusing on the wrong metrics can create blind spots and make it harder to communicate any risks to the rest of the business.So how do you know what to focus on? Cyber hygiene, scan coverage, average time to fix, vulnerability severity, remediation rates, vulnerability exposure… the list is endless. Every tool on the market offers different metrics, so it can be hard to know what is important.This article will help you identify and define the key metrics that you need to track the state of your vulnerability management program, the progress you've made, so you can create audit-ready reports that:- Prove your security posture- Meet vulnerability remediation SLAs and benchmarks- Help pass audits and compliance- Demonstrate ROI on security tools- Simplify risk analysis- Prioritize resource allocationWhy you need to measure vulnerability managementMetrics play a critical role in gauging the effectiveness of your vulnerability and attack surface management. Measuring how quickly you find, prioritize and fix flaws means you can continuously monitor and optimize your security.With the right analytics, you can see which issues are more critical, prioritize what to fix first, and measure the progress of your efforts. Ultimately, the right metrics allow you to make properly informed decisions, so you're allocating the resources to the right places.The number of vulnerabilities found is always a good starting point, but it doesn't tell you much in isolation – without prioritization, advisories and progress, where do you start? Finding, prioritizing and fixing your most critical vulnerabilities is far more important to your business operations and data security than simply finding every vulnerability.Intelligent prioritization and filtering out the noise are important because overlooking genuine security threats is all too easy when you're being overwhelmed by non-essential information. Intelligent results make your job easier by prioritizing issues that have real impact on your security, without burdening you with irrelevant weaknesses.For example, your internet-facing systems are the easiest targets for hackers. Prioritizing issues that leave this exposed makes it easier to minimize your attack surface. Tools like Intruder make vulnerability management easy even for non-experts, by explaining the real risks and providing remediation advice in easy-to-understand language. But beyond prioritization, what else should or could you be measuring?|An example of Intruder's vulnerability management report page5 top metrics for every vulnerability management programScan coverageWhat are you tracking and scanning? Scan coverage includes all the assets you're covering and analytics of all business-critical assets and applications, and the type of authentication offered (e.g., username- and password-based, or unauthenticated).As your attack surface evolves, changes and grows over time, it's important to monitor any changes to what's covered and your IT environment, such as recently opened ports and services. A modern scanner will detect deployments you may not have been aware of and prevent your sensitive data from becoming inadvertently exposed. It should also monitor your cloud systems for changes, discover new assets, and automatically synchronize your IPs or hostnames with cloud integrations.Average time to fixThe time it takes your team to fix your critical vulnerabilities reveals how responsive your team is when reacting to the results of any reported vulnerabilities. This should be consistently low since the security team is accountable for resolving issues and delivering the message and action plans for remediation to management. It should also be based on your pre-defined SLA. The severity of the vulnerability should have a corresponding relative or an absolute period of time for planning and remediation.Risk scoreThe severity of each issue is automatically calculated by your scanner, usually Critical, High or Medium. If you decide not to patch a specific or group of vulnerabilities within a specified time period, this is an acceptance of risk. With Intruder you can snooze an issue if you're willing to accept the risk and there are mitigating factors.For example, when you're preparing for a SOC2 or ISO audit and you can see a critical risk, you may be willing to accept it because the resource required to fix it isn't justified by the actual level of risk or potential impact on the business. Of course, when it comes to reporting, your CTO may want to know how many issues are being snoozed and why!IssuesThis is the point from a vulnerability going public, to having scanned all targets and detecting any issues. Essentially, how quickly are vulnerabilities being detected across your attack surface, so you can fix them and reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker.What does this mean in practice? If your attack surface is increasing, you may find that it takes you longer to scan everything comprehensively, and your mean time to detect may increase as well. Conversely, if your mean time to detect stays flat or goes down, you're using your resources effectively. If you start to see the opposite, you should ask yourself why it's taking longer to detect things? And if the answer is the attack surface has ballooned, maybe you need to invest more in your tooling and security team.Measuring progressPrioritization – or intelligent results – is important to help you decide what to fix first, because of its potential impact on your business. Intruder filters out the noise and helps reduce false positives, which is a key metric to track because once you reduce the amount of noise you can circle back and focus on the most important metric – the average time to fix.Why is this important? Because when you do find an issue, you want to be able to fix it as quickly as possible. Tools like Intruder use multiple scanning engines to interprets the output and prioritize the results according to context, so you can save time and focus on what really matters.|When a new vulnerability that could critically affect your systems is identified, Intruder will automatically kick-off a scanAttack surface monitoringThis helps you see the percentage of assets that are protected across your attack surface, discovered or undiscovered. As you team spins up new apps, vulnerability scanner should check when a new service is exposed, so you can prevent data from becoming inadvertently exposed. Modern scanners monitor your cloud systems for changes, finding new assets, and synchronizing your IPs or hostnames with your integrations.Why is this important? Your attack surface will inevitably evolve over time, from open ports to spinning up new cloud instances, you need to monitor these changes to minimize your exposure. That's where our attack surface discovery comes in. The number of new services discovered during the time period specified helps you understand if your attack surface is growing (whether intentionally or not).Why these metrics matterModern attack surface management tools like Intruder measure what matters most. They help provide reports for stakeholders and compliance with vulnerabilities prioritized and integrations with your issue tracking tools. You can see what's vulnerable and get the exact priorities, remedies, insights, and automation you need to manage your cyber risk. If you want to see Intruder in action you can request a demo or try it for free for 14 days.",marketing,vulnerability reports,FALSE
Exposed Docker APIs Under Attack in 'Commando Cat' Cryptojacking Campaign,"Exposed Docker API endpoints over the internet are under assault from a sophisticated cryptojacking campaign called Commando Cat.""The campaign deploys a benign container generated using the Commando project,"" Cado security researchers Nate Bill and Matt Muir said in a new report published today. ""The attacker escapes this container and runs multiple payloads on the Docker host.""The campaign is believed to have been active since the start of 2024, making it the second such campaign to be discovered in as many months. In mid-January, the cloud security firm also shed light on another activity cluster that targets vulnerable Docker hosts to deploy XMRig cryptocurrency miner as well as the 9Hits Viewer software.Commando Cat employs Docker as an initial access vector to deliver a collection of interdependent payloads from an actor-controlled server that is responsible for registering persistence, backdooring the host, exfiltrating cloud service provider (CSP) credentials, and launching the miner.The foothold obtained by breaching susceptible Docker instances is subsequently abused to deploy a harmless container using the Commando open-source tool and execute a malicious command that allows it to escape the confines of the container via the chroot command.It also runs a series of checks to determine if services named ""sys-kernel-debugger,"" ""gsc,"" ""c3pool_miner,"" and ""dockercache"" are active on the compromised system, and proceeds to the next stage only if this step passes.""The purpose of the check for sys-kernel-debugger is unclear – this service is not used anywhere in the malware, nor is it part of Linux,"" the researchers said. ""It is possible that the service is part of another campaign that the attacker does not want to compete with.""The succeeding phase entails dropping additional payloads from the command-and-control (C2) server, including a shell script backdoor (user.sh) that's capable of adding an SSH key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file and creating a rogue user named ""games"" with an attacker-known password and including it in the /etc/sudoers file.Also delivered in a similar manner are three more shell scripts – tshd.sh, gsc.sh, aws.sh – which are designed to drop Tiny SHell and an improvised version of netcat called gs-netcat, and exfiltrate credentialsThe threat actors ""run a command on the cmd.cat/chattr container that retrieves the payload from their own C2 infrastructure,"" Muir told The Hacker News, noting this is achieved by using curl or wget and piping the resulting payload directly into the bash command shell.""Instead of using /tmp, [gsc.sh] also uses /dev/shm instead, which acts as a temporary file store but memory backed instead,"" the researchers said. ""It is possible that this is an evasion mechanism, as it is much more common for malware to use /tmp.""The attack culminates in the deployment of another payload that's delivered directly as a Base64-encoded script as opposed to being retrieved from the C2 server, which, in turn, drops the XMRig cryptocurrency miner but not before eliminating competing miner processes from the infected machine.The exact origins of the threat actor behind Commando Cat are currently unclear, although the shell scripts and the C2 IP address have been observed to overlap with those linked to cryptojacking groups like TeamTNT in the past, raising the possibility that it may be a copycat group.""The malware functions as a credential stealer, highly stealthy backdoor, and cryptocurrency miner all in one,"" the researchers said. ""This makes it versatile and able to extract as much value from infected machines as possible.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

It was uploaded to Google Play on October 26, 2022, by a developer named Mohammad Rizwan and amassed a total of 1,000 downloads before it was taken down by Google.The exact distribution vector for the malware is currently not clear, although the nature of the apps suggests that the targets were tricked into downloading them as part of a honey-trap romance scam, where the perpetrators convince them to install these bogus apps under the pretext of having a more secure conversation.This is not the first time Patchwork – a threat actor with suspected ties to India – has leveraged this technique. In March 2023, Meta revealed that the hacking crew created fictitious personas on Facebook and Instagram to share links to rogue apps to target victims in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tibet, and China.It's also not the first time that the attackers have been observed deploying VajraRAT, which was previously documented by Chinese cybersecurity company QiAnXin in early 2022 as having been used in a campaign aimed at Pakistani government and military entities. Vajra gets its name from the Sanskrit word for thunderbolt.Qihoo 360, in its own analysis of the malware in November 2023, tied it to a threat actor it tracks under the moniker Fire Demon Snake (aka APT-C-52).Outside of Pakistan and India, Nepalese government entities have also been likely targeted via a phishing campaign that delivers a Nim-based backdoor. It has been attributed to the SideWinder group, another outfit that has been flagged as operating with Indian interests in mind.The development comes as financially motivated threat actors from Pakistan and India have been found targeting Indian Android users with a fake loan app (Moneyfine or ""com.moneyfine.fine"") as part of an extortion scam that manipulates the selfie uploaded as part of a know your customer (KYC) process to create a nude image and threatens victims to make a payment or risk getting the doctored photos distributed to their contacts.""These unknown, financially motivated threat actors make enticing promises of quick loans with minimal formalities, deliver malware to compromise their devices, and employ threats to extort money,"" Cyfirma said in an analysis late last month.It also comes amid a broader trend of people falling prey to predatory loan apps, which are known to harvest sensitive information from infected devices, and employ blackmail and harassment tactics to pressure victims into making the payments.According to a recent report published by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), teenagers from Australia, Canada, and the U.S. are increasingly targeted by financial sextortion attacks conducted by Nigeria-based cybercriminal group known as Yahoo Boys.""Nearly all of this activity is linked to West African cybercriminals known as the Yahoo Boys, who are primarily targeting English-speaking minors and young adults on Instagram, Snapchat, and Wizz,"" NCRI said.Wizz, which has since had its Android and iOS apps taken down from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, countered the NCRI report, stating it's ""not aware of any successful extortion attempts that occurred while communicating on the Wizz app.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

Volt Typhoon's botnet infected 'hundreds' of older routers,"FBI confirms it issued remote kill command to blow out Volt Typhoon's botnetDisinfects Cisco and Netgear routers to thwart Chinese crittersChina's Volt Typhoon spies infected ""hundreds"" of outdated Cisco and Netgear equipment with malware so that the devices could be instructed to break into US critical infrastructure facilities, the Justice Department has said.On Tuesday news broke that the Feds had blocked the malicious bot network that was set up on end-of-life, US-based small office/home office routers. Now more details have come out about how an FBI team infiltrated the operation and harvested crucial data before remotely wiping the KV Botnet, according to four warrants (5018, 5530, 5451 and 5432) filed by the FBI in a southern Texas court last month and released today.""China's hackers are targeting American civilian critical infrastructure, pre-positioning to cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities in the event of conflict,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. ""Volt Typhoon malware enabled China to hide as they targeted our communications, energy, transportation, and water sectors.""The Feds claim the Middle Kingdom's cyber-spies downloaded a virtual private network module to the vulnerable routers and set up an encrypted communication channel to remotely control the botnet, and potentially order the devices to carry out attacks as well as hide their activities. Specifically: Volt Typhoon used the US-based routers and IP addresses to target US critical infrastructure, we're told.- US shorts China's Volt Typhoon crew targeting America's criticals- Five Eyes and Microsoft accuse China of attacking US infrastructure again- We know nations are going after critical systems, but what happens when crims join in?- Ivanti releases patches for VPN zero-days, discloses two more high-severity vulnsThe warrants allowed law enforcement to remotely install software on the routers to search for, and then seize or copy, information about the illicit activity before wiping the malware from the compromised devices.To do this — and to limit the Feds' search to routers infected with the remote-control botnet malware — the FBI sent specific KV Botnet commands to compromised routers to collect ""non-content information about those nodes,"" according to the warrants.This includes the IP address, port numbers used by infected routers to communicate with other nodes, as well as IP addresses and ports used by each node's parent, and data on the command-and-control nodes.""A router that is not infected by the KV Botnet malware would not receive or respond to this command,"" court documents claim.The Feds, along with foreign agency partners in Five Eyes nations, first warned about this threat in May 2023.Also today, the US government's cybersecurity agency and the FBI issued an alert urging manufacturers to eliminate defects in SOHO router web management interfaces. This, according to the Feds, includes automating update capabilities, locating the web management interface on LAN-side ports only, and requiring an explicit manual override to remove security settings. ®",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
Biden veto waiting for bill to kill SEC breach report rule,"Biden will veto attempts to kill off SEC's security breach reporting rulesSenate, House can try but won't make it past the Prez, says White HouseThe Biden administration has expressed to congressional representatives its strong opposition to undoing the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) strict data breach reporting rule.In a policy statement [PDF] published yesterday by Biden's Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the administration said it ""strongly opposes"" Senate Joint Resolution 50, introduced in November by Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC). The joint resolution, along with House Joint Resolution 100, sponsored by Representative Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) and introduced the same day, would nullify the SEC rules adopted in July of last year.The SEC's rule require public companies hit by cybercriminals to report the incident within four days. Given that the SEC's primary concern is protecting investors, the body is mostly concerned with breaches that could have a ""material"" effect on a company's bottom line, and thus present a risk to shareholders.""The lack of transparency by public companies about cyber incidents impacting their operations and data is fueling increasing cyberattacks across all sectors and all industries,"" the Biden OMB said in its objection to the Senate bill. ""Greater transparency about cyber incidents, as required in the SEC's rule, will incentivize corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity and cyber risk management.""""If the president were presented with S.J. Res. 50, he would veto it,"" OMB said.Undoing any breach reporting requirement seems antithetical to the work a Senator ought to be doing; we asked Tillis's office to explain his reasoning, but didn't hear back.Garbarino, on the other hand, issued a statement in November after submitting his companion resolution in the House that makes his position on the matter clear: Breach reporting requirements are the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) job.""This cybersecurity disclosure rule is a complete overreach on the part of the SEC and one that is in direct conflict with congressional intent,"" Garbarino said in the November release. ""CISA, as the lead civilian cybersecurity agency, has been tasked with developing and issuing regulations for cyber incident reporting as it relates to covered entities.""Garbarino said Congress and the Biden administration are on the same page with regards to harmonizing cybersecurity reporting requirements (though that doesn't appear to be the case based on the OMB policy statement). He also said the SEC was simply creating duplicative requirements that ""further burden an understaffed cybersecurity workforce with additional and unnecessary reporting requirements.""Part of those concerns may stem from the public nature of SEC incident reports, which have to be submitted on SEC Form 8-K, the contents of which are public. Disclosures must include the scope, timing, and nature of the incident, though disclosure may be delayed if the US Attorney General determines doing so would pose a risk to national security or public safety.Tillis, in a brief comment on Garbarino's release, only described the SEC's reporting rule as Commission chair Gary Gensler doing his best ""to hurt market participants by overregulating firms into oblivion,"" with an onerous rule ""that creates unrealistic timelines and unnecessary red tape that will ultimately make markets less safe overall.""- SolarWinds slams SEC lawsuit against it as 'unprecedented' victim blaming- Future of America's Cyber Safety Review Board hangs in balance amid calls for rethink- Regulator, insurers and customers all coming for Progress after MOVEit breach- US State Dept has no idea if its IT security actually works, say auditorsIt's not clear what the Senator and Congressman think of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) 30-day breach reporting requirement passed in October, which isn't mentioned in the earlier statement or resolutions.Someone has to do somethingDespite Garbarino's professed belief that CISA is the one that should be handling breach reporting requirements, the agency has yet to pass any rules that would do so.President Biden signed the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) into law in March 2022, but CISA had 24 months from passage (March 2024) to present a rule for consideration, which it has yet to do. When CISA's reporting requirements eventually go into effect, the disclosure window will be even smaller than the SEC's. CIRCIA asked CISA to give cybersecurity incident victims a mere 72 hours – three days – to report a breach.In the meantime, the FTC and SEC have taken matters into their own hands, which appears to be helping – we've even been able to report on breaches at companies like HPE thanks to SEC reports.As previously reported, the number of victims paying ransomware operators has fallen to 29 percent. The company behind that statistic, ransomware negotiation firm Coveware, attributes much of the decrease in ransom payments in recent months to reporting requirements from the SEC and FTC.Those payments are down despite what the White House OMB said was a 45 percent increase in ransomware attacks year-over-year.""Reversing the SEC's rulemaking would not only disadvantage investors … but would also cause companies to undervalue investments in cyber programs to the detriment of our economic and national security,"" the OMB said.Then again, maybe giving the SEC cybersecurity reporting authority isn't the best move – after all, the agency can't even keep its Twitter account secure. ®",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
Google throws $1M at Rust Foundation to build C++ bridges,"Chocolate Factory matches Microsoft money for memory safetyGoogle on Monday donated $1 million to the Rust Foundation specifically to improve interoperability between the language and C++.C++, a popular general purpose programming language, has arguably fallen out of fashion due to concerns over safety. Memory safety errors are the source of the majority of vulnerabilities for Google and Microsoft, and this has led to evangelism for memory-safe Rust and a scarlet letter for C/C++.""Based on historical vulnerability density statistics, Rust has proactively prevented hundreds of vulnerabilities from impacting the Android ecosystem,"" said Dave Kleidermacher, Google VP of engineering, Android security and privacy, in a statement. ""This investment aims to expand the adoption of Rust across various components of the platform.""Thanks to endorsements by industry figures like Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich, and from public sector figures like CISA director Jen Easterly, not to mention industry efforts like ISRG's Prossimo, there's pressure on software developers to consider Rust and other memory-safe languages where suitable.Lars Bergstrom, director of Android platform tools and libraries and chair of the Rust Foundation Board, announced the grant and said that the funding will ""improve the ability of Rust code to interoperate with existing legacy C++ codebases.""Bergstrom told The Register that interoperability with C++ represents one of the biggest obstacles to broader adoption of Rust for Google and other organizations.""This is the most common hurdle all organizations have to overcome to increase their implementation of Rust,"" he said. ""Many existing legacy code bases, as well as core libraries and services, are either written in C++ or only have APIs available in C++, Java, Go, or Python. Integrating Rust today is possible where there is a fallback C API, but for high-performance and high-fidelity interoperability, improving the ability to work directly with C++ code is the single biggest initiative that will further the ability to adopt Rust.""- Microsoft seeks Rust developers to rewrite core C# code- Dump C++ and in Rust you should trust, Five Eyes agencies urge- Rusty revenant Servo returns to render once more- Google Go language goes with opt-in telemetryGoogle's Chromium project consists largely of C++ code, and Android uses the language too, alongside Java and others.According to Bergstrom, Google's most significant increase in the use of Rust has occurred in Android, where interoperability started receiving attention in 2021, although Rust is also being deployed elsewhere.""We also have a team working on building out interoperability,"" he added. ""We hope that this team’s work on addressing challenges specific to Google’s codebases will complement the industry-wide investments from this new grant we’ve provided to the Rust Foundation.""Google's grant matches a $1 million grant last November from Microsoft, which also committed $10 million in internal investment to make Rust a ""first-class language in our engineering systems."" The Google-bucks are expected to fund further interoperability efforts, along the lines of KDAB's bidirectional Rust and C++ bindings with Qt.Rebecca Rumbul, executive director and CEO of the Rust Foundation said in a statement that while Rust offers technical advantages, it's unrealistic to expect organizations to abandon existing codebases. The Rust Foundation has also created a new Interop Initiative to make it more simpleto integrate Rust into existing C++ projects and workflows. ®",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE

That said, the issues have been addressed in runC version 1.1.12 released today following responsible disclosure in November 2023. The three other Buildkit flaws have been fixed with version 0.12.5.""Because these vulnerabilities affect widely used low-level container engine components and container build tools, Snyk strongly recommends that users check for updates from any vendors providing their container runtime environments, including Docker, Kubernetes vendors, cloud container services, and open source communities,"" the company said.Docker, in an independent advisory, said the vulnerabilities can only be exploited if a user actively engages with malicious content by incorporating it into the build process or running a container from a rogue image.""Potential impacts include unauthorized access to the host filesystem, compromising the integrity of the build cache, and, in the case of CVE-2024-21626, a scenario that could lead to full container escape,"" Docker said.In February 2019, runC maintainers addressed another high-severity flaw (CVE-2019-5736, CVSS score: 8.6) that could be abused by an attacker to break out of the container and obtain root access on the host.Cloud and container security weaknesses continue to be an attack risk, what with organizations granting excessive permissions and administrative privileges to accounts during initial setup, leaving behind misconfiguration and privilege escalation opportunities for attackers.""This practice creates undue risk when a majority of severe cloud security incidents with material impact are tied to the failed management of identities, access, and privileges,"" Sysdig noted in its 2024 Cloud-Native Security and Usage Report.

Deepfakes mean biometric security measures won't be enough,"Rise of deepfake threats means biometric security measures won't be enoughDefenses need a rethink in face of increasing sophisticationCyber attacks using AI-generated deepfakes to bypass facial biometrics security will lead a third of organizations to doubt the adequacy of identity verification and authentication tools as standalone protections.Or so says consultancy and market watcher Gartner, as deepfakes dominate the news since sexually explicit AI-generated viral images of popstar Taylor Swift prompted fans, Microsoft, and the White House to call for action.However, the relentless march of AI technology can also be the cause of headaches for enterprise security. Remote account recovery, for example, might rely on an image of the individual's face to unlock security. But since these could be beaten by images copied from social media and other sources, security systems employed ""liveness detection"" to see if the request was from the right individual.As well as matching an individual's image to the one on record, systems relying on liveness detection also try to test if they are really there through an ""active"" request such as a head movement or ""passive"" sensing of micro facial movements and the focus of the eyes.Yet these approaches could now be duped by AI deepfakes and need to be supplemented by additional layers of security, Gartner's VP Analyst Akif Khan told The Register.He said that defense against the new threat can come from supplementing existing measures or improving on them.""Let's say, for example, the vendor knows that an IP verification process shows the user is running an iPhone 13 and understands the camera resolution of the device, then if the [presented deepfake doesn't match these parameters] it might suggest that it's been digitally injected,"" he said.- Dems and Repubs agree on something – a law to tackle unauthorized NSFW deepfakes- 'I'm sorry for everything...'

""One vendor showed me an example of several deepfake images that they had detected, and the faces looked very different,"" Khan told us.""However, when you really zoomed in there were on each of the heads three or four hairs, which were all in the absolute exact same kind of configuration of like three or four hairs overlapping with each other in a way that just looked eerily identical across these like three or four different people. That was like an artifact that they use to determine that actually these are synthetically created images.""Organizations should use both approaches to defend against deepfake threats to biometric security, he said.""It's classic defense-in-depth security.

Data in apps used for aircraft safety remotely tampered with,"Researchers remotely exploit devices used to manage safe aircraft landings and takeoffsThe closest thing we may ever get to a real-life Die Hard 2 scenarioCriminals could remotely tamper with the data that apps used by airplane pilots rely on to inform safe takeoff and landing procedures, according to fresh research.In a scenario that elicits strong memories of that nail-biting flight scene from Die Hard 2, researchers investigating electronic flight bags (EFBs) found the app used by Airbus pilots was vulnerable to remote data manipulation, given the right conditions.In reality, that Die Hard scene was, surprise surprise, riddled with plot holes – the researchers proved that a few months ago – but proving the possibility of something similar would always be exciting.An EFB is usually a tablet or tablet-like portable computer that runs aviation-specific apps used for a variety of flight deck or cabin tasks, such as making calculations to improve aircraft performance.The vulnerability was found in Flysmart+ Manager, one of many apps within the Flysmart+ suite used by Airbus pilots to synchronize data to other Flysmart+ apps which provide data to pilots informing safe takeoffs and landings.Developed by Airbus-owned NAVBLUE, Flysmart+ Manager was found to have disabled app transport security (ATS), by setting the NSAllowsArbitraryLoads property list key to ""true."" ATS is a key security control responsible for securing communications between the app and the app's update server.""ATS is a security mechanism that forces the application to use HTTPS, preventing unencrypted communications,"" blogged Antonio Cassidy, partner at Pen Test Partners, who carried out the research. ""An attacker could use this weakness to intercept and decrypt potentially sensitive information in transit.""A feasible attack would have to involve the interception of data flowing to the app, and a number of very specific conditions would need to be met. Even Ken Munro, another partner at Pen Test Partners, admitted exploitation would be unlikely in a real-world scenario.Oh, yes that hotel the airline always uses....First, an attacker would need to be within Wi-Fi range of the EFB loaded with Flysmart+ Manager. Sounds unlikely, but Munro said airlines often use the same hotels to accommodate their pilots between flights, and you can spot them, and the airline they work for, fairly easily.Secondly, and perhaps the biggest blockade to realistic exploitability, is the fact that an attacker would need to be monitoring the device's traffic at the time of the EFB handler initiating an app update.The update cycle is determined by the Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control (AIRAC) database. The AIRAC database can be updated with important information such as when new runways are installed or made temporarily unavailable, or when significant changes are made to the runway environment, like the installation of a crane.When the database is updated with new data, the app must download it to provide pilots with accurate and timely information. This is typically done once a month.The attack scenario devised by the researchers involved targeting a pilot sitting at a hotel bar – so, within Wi-Fi range – and performing directional Wi-Fi hunting while targeting a specific endpoint that the attacker would be aware of as they know the target app.""Given that airlines typically use the same hotel for pilots who are down route / on a layover, an attacker could target the hotel's Wi-Fi networks with the goal of modifying aircraft performance data,"" said Cassidy.In developing a proof-of-concept for an exploit, the researchers were able to access data being downloaded from update servers. Most of it came in the form of SQLite databases, with some including weight balance data of an aircraft and the minimum equipment list – information on what systems can be inoperative for a flight.Cassidy said the possible consequences of a successful exploit could include an airplane tailstrike or a failed takeoff, leading to runway excursions.""Do I think this is likely? No, absolutely not,"" said Munro. ""But, the point is there is a vulnerability. There are issues with flight systems and the good news is we're finding them and manufacturers are fixing it.""- Tablet computer zoom error saw plane fly 13 hours with 46cm hole- YouTuber who crashed plane for sponsorship dollars earns 6 months behind bars- If anyone finds an $80M F-35 stealth fighter, please call the Pentagon- Pilots get electronic flight bagAirbus was commended by the researchers for fixing the issue within 19 months, which is in the expected range for aviation tech, they said.A window of 19 months would be entirely unacceptable in regular IT patching, but in aviation, an update like this would typically take around 12 months, so not a million miles away. A longer period of time is required for it to go through certification processes with the aviation industry, we're told.Munro said: ""Could that be a bit quicker? Yeah, I think it could have been a bit quicker, but they fixed it – that's the important thing, and it was done in a reasonable amount of time for aviation software.""One active commercial pilot told The Register the finding was a ""concern,"" particularly with regard to takeoff performance speeds since the Airbus performance program is known for producing different speeds and flap settings to optimize takeoffs. They said because of this frequent change, a pilot probably wouldn't spot a manipulated dataset if it appeared in the EFB app, which could lead to dangerous takeoff procedures.Some airlines have gross error checks that examine the relationship between the calculated speed and actual aircraft speed, based on the aircraft's weight and balance data, the type which was accessed by the researchers while looking into Flysmart+ Manager.""I assume [these checks] would pick up a hack… but I couldn't say that categorically,"" the pilot said.Responding to the research, an Airbus spokesperson said: ""We identified a potential vulnerability in a specific version of the NAVBLUE FlySmart+ EFB product in 2022.""Our analysis, confirmed by EASA, showed that there was no safety issue thanks to the security procedures in place to validate flight-relevant data.

Others say ultrasound systems were down and prescriptions were being handled using analog, pen-and-paper methods.Lurie Children's Hospital said in a statement: ""As Illinois' leading provider for pediatric care, our overarching priority is to continue providing safe, quality care to our patients and the communities we serve. Lurie Children's is open and providing care to patients with as limited disruption as possible.""We are very grateful to our workforce and care providers who are committed to preserving our charitable mission during this time. We recognize the concern and inconvenience the systems outage may cause our patient-families and community providers and are working diligently to resolve this matter as quickly and effectively as possible.""The hospital treats more than 200,000 children a year and is home to the Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute, which is actively researching a range of pediatric illnesses and injuries.Attribution for the attack hasn't been made, nor has any ransomware or other cybercrime group claimed responsibility for it.The incident closely follows another attack at Saint Anthony Hospital, based just 8km (five miles) from Lurie, with the ""credit"" swiftly claimed by the LockBit ransomware gang.The attack on Saint Anthony's system began in December 2023 and the hospital only recently disclosed the extent of the damage – data theft but little to no operational downtime or disruption.It appears the hospital didn't pay the ransom and the stolen data has been published by LockBit, which is entirely unsurprising given the $800,000 ransom the gang set. Even if Saint Anthony Hospital were inclined to pay, which is very much not the officially recommended route to take, given the lofty sum and the fact it's a non-profit, it's unlikely the hospital would be able to pay anyway.The healthcare sector has long been a primary target for cybercriminals for many reasons, from generally poorer security postures to the operational disruption an attack on a hospital or similar facility can cause, and everything in between.- Alert: This ransomware preys on healthcare orgs via weak-ass VPN servers- Interpol's latest cybercrime intervention dismantles ransomware, banking malware servers- LockBit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children's hospital- Ransomware payment rates drop to new low – now 'only 29% of victims' fork over cashWhen critical services like these are floored, the chances of making a speedy payment to restore access to key systems is, in theory, more likely than a corporate company that has more time to think about a response strategy.However, according to new rules reportedly set for imminent approval, US hospitals will have to meet certain cybersecurity standards to receive federal funding in a move the government will hope stems the tide on ransomware's targeting of hospitals.During El Reg's investigation, we were pointed to a December concept paper from the US Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) cybersecurity strategy. The paper included proposals for enforcing new standards that if met, would offer financial support and incentives for hospitals. ®",data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,TRUE
Twin Max-Severity Bugs Open Fortinet's SIEM to Code Execution,"February 6, 2024Two critical vulnerabilities in Fortinet's FortiSIEM product have been assigned provisional CVSS scores of 10. However, details about the bugs remain scant.What is known is that the vulnerabilities, tracked under CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109, are command injection flaws that could potentially let threat actors use crafted API requests to execute unauthorized code.FortiSIEM is Fortinet's security information and event management (SIEM) platform, used for enabling enterprise cybersecurity operations centers.FortiSIEM versions impacted by the flaws include version 7.1.0 through 7.1.1; 7.0.0 through 7.0.2; 6.7.0 through 6.7.8; 6.6.0 through 6.6.3; 6.5.0 through 6.5.2; and 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, according to the CVE entries.The link Fortinet provided for information on the flaws leads to a write-up on another FortiSIEM vulnerability from October 2023, suggesting there might be a link between that bug and these new discoveries. The previous flaw was assigned a CVSS score of 9.7.Dark Reading asked Fortinet for additional details but has not yet received a response.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",vulnerability reports,vulnerability reports,TRUE
Akira and 8Base are the ransomware gangs to watch in 2024,"New kids on the ransomware block in 2023: Akira and 8Base lead dozens of newbiesHow good are your takedowns when fresh gangs are linked to previous ops, though?At least 25 new ransomware gangs emerged in 2023, with Akira and 8Base proving the most ""successful,"" research reveals.The gangs were the two ""success"" stories of the year for cybercrooks, proving that the lure of big ransom payouts is still enough to attract significant interest from fledgling ransomware operations, despite the challenges that remain for newcomers.For one thing, there's more and more attention from law enforcement agencies, which shut down numerous operations last year, for example, and this threatens to be a serious deterrent for this year's shenanigans.The high degree of competition between gangs was also listed as another reason for some groups dropping off the scene, according to researchers at Unit 42 by Palo Alto Networks. Cybercriminals must offer competitive payouts to affiliates while also offering a ransomware payload that's effective enough to attract capable criminals to their program and away from powerful competitors like LockBit and ALPHV/BlackCat.Get your hankies ready – some gangs didn't make it...The difficulties facing ransomware groups may explain why so many failed to survive last year. Five of the 25 newcomers didn't make it to see their first birthday, failing to register a single attack in the final six months of the year.- Is critical infrastructure prepared for OT ransomware?- Akira ransomware gang says it stole passport scans from Lush in 110 GB data heist- US readies prison cell for another Russian Trickbot developer- Analysis of leaked Conti files blows lid off ransomware gang""A lack of leak site posts does not necessarily mean these groups have ceased operations. Criminals from these groups could have moved to other types of operations, retreated from public view, or merged with other ransomware groups,"" blogged Doel Santos, principal threat researcher at Unit 42.""If some of these groups did not last the entire year, new threat actors can fill the void. The second half of 2023 revealed posts from 12 new leak sites, indicating these groups might have started later in the year.""Of the 25 new gangs identified by Unit 42, at least 12 of them are connected to pre-existing groups either as offshoots or as suspected rebrands of operations that closed down.The full list of the new gangs from 2023 is below, including details about whether they are still active and where relevant, what other gang they're supposedly connected to.-8Base (linked to Phobos)-Abyss-Akira (linked to Conti)-BlackSuit (linked to Conti)-Cactus-CiphBit-Cloak (linked to ARCrypter)-(Inactive) CrossLock-(Inactive) CryptNet (linked to Chaos)-Cyclops-(Inactive) DarkRace (linked to LockBit)-Hunters International-INC-Knight (Cyclops)-LostTrust (MetaEncryptor)-NoEscape (linked to Avaddon)-Meow-Money Message-RA Group (linked to Babuk)-(Inactive) Rancoz-(Inactive) Ransomed.vc-Rhysida (linked to Vice Society)-ThreeAM-Trigona (linked to Crylock)-U-BombThe 25 new ransomware operations accounted for roughly a quarter of all publicly claimed ransomware incidents in 2023.We say ""publicly claimed"" because the number of actual ransomware attacks is likely to be much higher, but due to poor disclosure or paying ransoms early, we'll never get to learn about them.Out of all the newcomers, Akira is thought to be the fastest-growing of the bunch and has so far claimed a number of major attacks, such as cosmetics giant Lush in just the past few weeks.According to BlackFog's analysis [PDF] of January 2024's ransomware incidents, Akira laid claim to roughly 12 percent of them, making it the second-most active group of the year so far. It's hardly unsurprising if Conti is indeed behind the operation – Conti at the height of its powers was the most feared group of its time… before it imploded, of course.That said, Wizard Spider, the heavily sanctioned gang behind Ryuk, Conti, Trickbot, and others remains (mostly) at large thanks to Russia's blind-eye approach to cybercriminals' behavior, as long as all the nastiness is directed to the West.8Base is a group that was technically established in 2022, Santos said, but given that its leak blog didn't go live until May 2023, it's being lumped together with last year's newbies.It started the year strongly, consistently registering more attacks than Akira, and although the latter eventually overtook 8Base by the end of the year, Unit 42's figures showed very little difference in the final numbers, suggesting it was just as effective as Akira.The two gangs were the standout ""performers"" of the 25 new operations last year and, while it wasn't included in Unit42's list, the Russian-language WereWolves group which rapidly rose to prominence towards the very end of the year looks as though it will continue to make a mark this year.All groups will also be looking to sweep up the market share left behind by the groups that fell last year, in large part due to the work of international law enforcement agencies.Hive, Ragnar Locker, Ransomed.vc, and Trigona were all shuttered by law enforcement last year, and authorities nearly got hold of ALPHV too but the group managed to wrestle back control during a multi-day struggle with the FBI.The takedowns were celebrated at the time but as industry pros wound down for their Christmas holidays, the debate around ransomware payments heated up and ultimately watered down the significance of the authorities' efforts.",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
How a $10B Enterprise Customer Drastically Increased their SaaS Security Posture with 201% ROI by Using SSPM,"SaaS applications are the darlings of the software world. They enable work from anywhere, facilitate collaboration, and offer a cost-effective alternative to owning the software outright. At the same time, the very features that make SaaS apps so embraced – access from anywhere and collaboration – can also be exploited by threat actors.Recently, Adaptive Shield commissioned a Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) study conducted by Forrester Consulting. The study demonstrates the impactful ROI achieved by a multimedia company with an annual revenue of $10 billion. While the quantitative ROI is significant, at 201%, the qualitative security ROI improvements were substantial.|Figure 1: Summary of the TEI StudyIn this article, we'll examine the study's findings of how Adaptive Shield's SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) platform impacted this global enterprise.The Organization's Top SaaS ChallengesIn interviews with Forrester Consulting, the organization being studied pointed out several key challenges that were facing in their SaaS stack leading up to 2022.- The organization acknowledged that they lacked the knowledge and skill to manage the applications. They didn't understand many of the unique configurations or the impact they had on security or compliance, which left them unaware of the risks or mitigations that needed to happen.- The organization had experienced an increase in SaaS adoption across IT, HR, sales, marketing, and other departments. They recognized that sensitive assets and valuable data were moving into SaaS applications and being spread out in a way that the security team could no longer supervise all its comings and goings. In addition, they needed to foster collaboration between the app owners, who control the applications, and security teams that are tasked with securing them.- They were also dealing with increased complexity caused by their Merger & Acquisition (M&A) activity. Each M&A increased the number of applications that they needed to manage, many of which were geographically-distributed tenants that could not be easily combined with existing tenants of the app.The organization began looking for a solution that could alleviate the SaaS misconfigurations that they were dealing with at scale. They needed a platform that would integrate with multiple business applications, mitigate communication issues between the app owners and security teams, and help them maintain regulatory compliance in their SaaS stack.They were impressed with Adaptive Shield's platform which not only demonstrated the widest coverage of supported applications but also found configuration issues during the proof of concept phase. In 2022, Adaptive Shield was selected and deployed to secure the organization's stack.Security Benefits Adaptive Shield Introduced to the OrganizationForrester Consulting found that Adaptive Shield enabled the security team to ""gain complete control and increased visibility of the security posture of all business-critical applications.""Increased SaaS Security PostureThe security team had dealt with six security issues stemming from misconfigurations and low-security posture in the past. However, the organization saw posture improvements beginning with the POC. They ""realized substantial improvement in its security posture score through visibility, remediation guidance, and ongoing monitoring"" while experiencing a 30% increase in posture.Improved CollaborationForrester Consulting also found evidence of increased collaboration between security teams and app owners. They noted that business owners are critical players in securing applications, as they have ""the key to the kingdom,"" but they lacked the security expertise needed to secure their ecosystem. Deploying Adaptive Shield helped bridge that gap and foster collaboration between the app owners and security teams.Many Other Security BenefitsWhile some security benefits were quantifiable by the Forrester Consulting team, they were unable to place a dollar value on everything offered by Adaptive Shield. For example, Forrester Consulting found that the automated processes within the Adaptive Shield platform allowed security teams to focus on security management rather than conduct interviews with app owners about their configurations. It also helped the organization overcome challenges introduced by the democratization of SaaS security. It helped the organization achieve continuous compliance, avoiding any interruptions to business operations, and staying ahead of any SaaS security trends.Why Economic Benefits Indicated a 201% ROIThe Total Economic Impact™ study measured the return on investment experienced by the organization that was interviewed. To quantify these findings, Forrester Consulting first calculated the value of an improved SaaS Security posture. They factored in the number of breaches that had taken place before Adaptive Shield was deployed and projected the number of breaches over three years. Their calculations included diminished productivity, impacted business and security users, and salary data. Their three-year present value estimate of an improved SaaS Security posture was $1.49M.|Figure 2: Breakdown of ROI by CategoryNext, Forrester Consulting reviewed operational efficiency achieved through the Adaptive Shield's SSPM platform. They factored in the number of applications being monitored, hourly wages, and the cost of securing SaaS applications with and without an automated solution. Their estimated three-year present value of savings was $397K.Forrester Consulting then turned its attention to compliance. They calculated improvements in efficiency based on the time it takes organizations to review their applications and ensure compliance with the different standards. Their three-year present value was worth $260K.Improved collaboration between security teams and business app owners added another 32K in savings over three years at present value. While the study noted other areas of ROI, it wasn't able to quantify them.The total benefits over three years (at present value) totaled $2.18M. The total licensing and deployment costs over those three years, at present value, was $723,866. Payback was reached in less than six months, and the ROI over the three-year time frame was 201%.A Push Toward SaaS SecurityToday, organizations are increasing the volume and value of data stored in the cloud. Modern SaaS apps contain highly sensitive data, including PII, intellectual property, and third-party confidential information. Protecting this data is paramount, and the only realistic way to secure it is through a SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) tool.Organizations understand the need to secure their SaaS stack. At the same time, they need to justify the cost of adding new security tools. By demonstrating significant, measurable ROI, organizations can finally make the case for implementing an SSPM solution.Note: This article has been expertly written by Maor Bin, CEO and co-founder of Adaptive Shield.",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
How Neurodiversity Can Help Fill the Cybersecurity Workforce Shortage,"February 6, 2024COMMENTARYOne of the most vexing issues in cybersecurity doesn't have to do with technology; it has to do with people. Finding enough cybersecurity professionals to fill open positions in the public and private sectors has been a problem for more than a decade, and, despite efforts from both sectors, the situation has not improved. The most recent (2022) report from ISC2 puts the US cyber workforce gap at 410,695 — up 9% from the 2021 report. ISC2 says the global gap is 3.4 million, noting that the supply of cybersecurity workers cannot keep up with the demand. The global workforce gap increased by over 25% from 2021 to 2022, and nearly 70% of the cyber professionals surveyed for the ISC2 report said their organization has a worker shortage.One ISC2 recommendation for filling the gap is to recruit a more diverse population, as cybersecurity work requires a variety of skills at a variety of levels, and a good portion of the work comes down to problem-solving. Having a diverse workforce generates different perspectives and ways to solve problems, adding important dimensions to the cyber skill set.While many companies are focusing on important diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts around race and gender, many of the top science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) companies, such as Microsoft, SAP, and EY, are looking to increase neurodiversity in their workforce. Neurodiversity describes the natural variation in human brains that leads to differences in the way we think, learn, and work. While neurodiversity hiring programs originally focused on autism, many employers have expanded their recruitment to include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, and other (sometimes nonlabeled) differences that bring a new perspective to their workforce.Neurodiversity as a Competitive AdvantageResearch in psychology and neuroscience points to several assets that neurodivergent people may bring to the workforce. Some people with autism excel in detailed pattern recognition and systematic thinking — talents that software companies have leveraged in areas such as quality assurance and debugging. These skills are remarkably well-suited for cybersecurity tasks such as monitoring and detecting security breaches.ADHD and dyslexia are associated with increased idea generation and the ability to see connections between new ideas. In addition, employers have found the nonconformity and innovative thinking that people with ADHD or dyslexia bring to the workforce valuable for approaching problems in new and different ways. Employers also appreciate the persistence and focus many of their neurodivergent employees demonstrate, which leads to thorough problem-solving and follow through. Many STEM employers say that neurodiversity in their workforce is a competitive advantage.How to Recruit Neurodiverse TalentOne problem these companies face is not finding enough neurodivergent talent. Unfortunately, many of our best learners are discouraged from STEM through schooling that focuses on their deficits rather than their talents. Many brilliant problem solvers leave school thinking they are intellectually unfit for any professional career, let alone cybersecurity.This is why we must start looking at neurodiversity differently in our education systems. We must engage learners in student-centered learning, where their own interests and talents guide the learning process. When this happens, each learner can discover their own strengths and work from those. When they feel confident and strong as learners, their deficits can also be addressed. But if we make them feel like losers from the start, we've given up on them before they can play the game.My research shows that companies that have successful neurodiversity workforce programs have changed the way they recruit, interview, hire, and manage their employees.Placing more emphasis on performance than on communications.Providing opportunities for employees to work and express themselves in different ways, not always adhering to one cultural norm.Encouraging managers to foster clear guidelines and expectations, with meeting agendas prepared in advance and meetings documented clearly afterwards, so that nothing gets missed or misinterpreted.Doing work in teams where each person can work to their strengths, contributing where they are best suited, and relying on others for areas where they struggle.Not surprisingly, many companies find that the accommodations they make for neurodivergent learners are what all their employees see as good management. Everyone benefits from the new ways of working.The need for cybersecurity professionals will expand as artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies come online. Meeting these needs will require an innovative, creative, persistent workforce with a keen eye for detail and systematic thinking. These folks are out there. They are in our classrooms today. Educators and cybersecurity companies just need to reach them where they are and give them a chance.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",marketing,news and industry updates,FALSE
Akamai Announces Content Protector to Stop Scraping Attacks,"February 6, 2024PRESS RELEASECAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced the availability of Content Protector, a product that stops scraping attacks without blocking the good traffic that companies need to enhance their business.Scraper bots are a critical and often productive part of the commerce ecosystem. These bots search for new content, highlight products in comparison sites, and gather updated product information to share with customers. Unfortunately, scrapers also get used for harmful purposes such as competitive undercutting, surveillance before inventory hoarding attacks, and counterfeiting goods and websites. Scrapers also ping sites 24/7 unless stopped — so they can degrade site performance, which in turn frustrates consumers and causes them to abandon their visits. In addition, scrapers have become much more evasive and sophisticated over the past few years.Akamai Content Protector helps detect and mitigate evasive scrapers that steal content for malicious purposes. It enables improved site performance, an enhanced user experience and protection of intellectual property while facilitating significantly better detections and fewer false negatives without increasing the rate of false positives. The product is designed for companies that need to protect their reputation and revenue potential. It offers tailored detections that include:Protocol-level assessment: Protocol fingerprinting checks how visitors connect to your site to ensure they're legitimate. It evaluates how the client establishes the connection with the server at the different layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model — verifying that the parameters negotiated align with the one expected from the most common web browsers and mobile applications.Application-level assessment: Evaluates if the client can run some business logic written in JavaScript. When the client runs JavaScript, it collects the device and browser characteristics and user preferences. These various data points are compared and cross-checked against the protocol-level data to verify consistency.User interaction: Analyzes user interactions to distinguish between human and bot traffic. It assesses how users interact with devices such as touch screens, keyboards, and mouse, identifying bots through their lack of interaction or abnormal usage patterns.User behavior: Monitors visitor behavior on your website to identify unusual patterns indicative of bots.Risk classification: Provides a deterministic and actionable low-, medium-, or high-risk classification of the traffic, based on the anomalies found during the evaluation.""Content Protector is more than just a security tool; it's a business enabler,"" says Rupesh Chokshi, SVP and GM, Application Security at Akamai. ""By safeguarding your digital assets from scraping threats, it prevents competitors from undercutting your offers, enhances site performance to keep customers engaged, and protects your brand from counterfeiters. Content Protector provides direct business value to grow your digital business with confidence.""About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

Beware: Fake Facebook Job Ads Spreading 'Ov3r_Stealer' to Steal Crypto and Credentials,"Threat actors are leveraging bogus Facebook job advertisements as a lure to trick prospective targets into installing a new Windows-based stealer malware codenamed Ov3r_Stealer.""This malware is designed to steal credentials and crypto wallets and send those to a Telegram channel that the threat actor monitors,"" Trustwave SpiderLabs said in a report shared with The Hacker News.Ov3r_Stealer is capable of siphoning IP address-based location, hardware info, passwords, cookies, credit card information, auto-fills, browser extensions, crypto wallets, Microsoft Office documents, and a list of antivirus products installed on the compromised host.While the exact end goal of the campaign is unknown, it's likely that the stolen information is offered for sale to other threat actors. Another possibility is that Ov3r_Stealer could be updated over time to act as a QakBot-like loader for additional payloads, including ransomware.The starting point of the attack is a weaponized PDF file that purports to be a file hosted on OneDrive, urging users to click on an ""Access Document"" button embedded into it.Trustwave said it identified the PDF file being shared on a fake Facebook account impersonating Amazon CEO Andy Jassy as well as via Facebook ads for digital advertising jobs.Users who end up clicking on the button are served an internet shortcut (.URL) file that masquerades as a DocuSign document hosted on Discord's content delivery network (CDN). The shortcut file then acts as a conduit to deliver a control panel item (.CPL) file, which is then executed using the Windows Control Panel process binary (""control.exe"").The execution of the CPL file leads to the retrieval of a PowerShell loader (""DATA1.txt"") from a GitHub repository to ultimately launch Ov3r_Stealer.It's worth noting at this stage that a near-identical infection chain was recently disclosed by Trend Micro as having put to use by threat actors to drop another stealer called Phemedrone Stealer by exploiting the Microsoft Windows Defender SmartScreen bypass flaw (CVE-2023-36025, CVSS score: 8.8).The similarities extend to the GitHub repository used (nateeintanan2527) and the fact that Ov3r_Stealer shares code-level overlaps with Phemedrone.""This malware has recently been reported, and it may be that Phemedrone was re-purposed and renamed to Ov3r_Stealer,"" Trustwave said. ""The main difference between the two is that Phemedrone is written in C#.""Further solidifying the connections between the two stealer malware, the threat actor has been observed sharing news reports published about the Phemedrone Stealer on their Telegram channels in an effort to build ""street cred"" for their malware-as-a-service (MaaS) business.""My custom stealer is on the new[s], showing how evasive it is, im [sic] the developer of it, so happy now,"" the threat actor, who goes by the online alias Liu Kong said, while also expressing frustration at the fact that threat hunters managed to ""reverse the whole exploit chain"" despite everything being ""on memory.""The findings come as Hudson Rock revealed that threat actors are advertising their access to law enforcement request portals of major organizations like Binance, Google, Meta, and TikTok by exploiting credentials obtained from infostealer infections.They also follow the emergence of a category of infections called CrackedCantil that leverage cracked software as an initial access vector to drop loaders like PrivateLoader and SmokeLoader, when subsequently act as a delivery mechanism for information stealers, crypto miners, proxy botnets, and ransomware.",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Verizon says 63K employee info wrongly accessed by insider,"Verizon says 63K employees' info fell into the wrong hands – an insider this timeTelco says it's a private matter, data 'not shared externally'Verizon is notifying more than 63,000 people, mostly current employees, that an insider, accidentally or otherwise, had inappropriate access to their personal data.The privacy blunder happened in September, and the American telco giant attributed it to ""inadvertent disclosure"" and ""insider wrongdoing"" in documents submitted to the Maine Attorney General. The Pine Tree state's strict data loss rules require security snafu disclosures, even though in this case only 82 of its residents were directly affected.At the heart of the drama: A Verizon employee apparently obtained a file that they shouldn't have had access to, containing personal information including: names, addresses, Social Security numbers or other national identifiers, gender, union affiliation (if applicable), dates of birth, and compensation information.Of the 63,206 people to receive privacy breach notifications [PDF], ""the vast majority of the impacted are current Verizon employees,"" spokesperson Rich Young told The Register. There are some former Verizon employees included who they will be notified and offered the same [identity protection] services as current team members.""An internal review of the error remains ongoing, though as of now it does not appear to be a rogue insider intent on selling coworker info on criminal marketplaces, we're told.""There is no indication of malicious intent nor do we believe the information was shared externally,"" Verizon's Young said.When asked what, if anything, happened to the employee behind the inadvertent disclosure, Young added: ""We're not going to discuss any employee involved as these are private, personnel matters.""- Verizon prepaid accounts hijacked by SIM swap crooks- EquiLend back in the saddle as ransom payment rumors swirl- Double trouble for Fortinet customers as pair of critical vulns found in FortiSIEM- Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security holeIn light of the snafu, Verizon tells us it is boosting its technical controls to prevent future unauthorized file access. The cellular giant is also offering affected individuals two years of free credit monitoring and identity protection services and if fraud occurs, they can receive up to $1 million in reimbursement for stolen funds and expenses.Verizon's most recent security snafu happened back in October 2022 when some of its prepaid customers' accounts were compromised by crooks attempting to hijack their phone numbers via SIM swapping methods.""Between October 6 and October 10, 2022, a third party actor accessed the last four digits of the credit card used to make automatic payments on your account,"" the mobile network operator said at the time.From there, the criminals attempted to transfer the victims' phone numbers to other devices, which would allow the fraudsters to access one-time security codes and then break into the victims' banking apps and other online accounts. ®",vulnerability reports,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
JetBrains issues urgent patches for critical TeamCity vuln,"JetBrains urges swift patching of latest critical TeamCity flawCloud version is safe, but no assurances offered about possible on-prem exploitsJetBrains is encouraging all users of TeamCity (on-prem) to upgrade to the latest version following the disclosure of a critical vulnerability in the CI/CD tool.Tracked as CVE-2024-23917, the vulnerability has been assigned a provisional 9.8 CVSS score and allows unauthenticated remote attackers to take over vulnerable servers with admin privileges.""All versions from 2017.1 through 2023.11.2 are affected by this issue,"" Daniel Gallo, solutions engineer at JetBrains, said in an advisory. ""The issue has been patched in 2023.11.3. We recommend upgrading as soon as possible.""The vulnerability only requires attention for admins of on-prem servers since TeamCity Cloud has already been patched. JetBrains also confirmed that no attacks had been detected against TeamCity Cloud, but made no such assertions about the on-prem product.Patching can be carried out by downloading the latest version, using the automatic update feature within TeamCity itself, or by using the security patch plugin which addresses CVE-2024-23917 only.JetBrains said it's always best to just upgrade the whole server – as users will then receive all the other security fixes that come with it – rather than just patching the single vulnerability.- The spyware business is booming despite government crackdowns- Chinese Coathanger malware hung out to dry by Dutch defense department- Double trouble for Fortinet customers as pair of critical vulns found in FortiSIEM- Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security holeIf, for whatever reason, any of the patches or mitigations can't be applied immediately, it's recommended that public-facing TeamCity servers should be made inaccessible until the critical flaw is addressed.The disclosure comes just a few months after it was revealed that state-sponsored attackers from Russia and North Korea were separately targeting TeamCity servers vulnerable to a similar flaw announced in September.CVE-2023-42793 also registered a 9.8 severity score and activity from foreign offensive cyber units prompted leading Western authorities to issue an advisory, urging swift patching.There was no evidence to suggest the access the attackers had was used to lay the groundwork for a SolarWinds-like attack, which is always the fear when there are reports of CI/CD compromises.Instead, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) exploited the vulnerability to move laterally around victim's networks and plant backdoors to facilitate follow-on attacks.The SVR used the GraphicalProton backdoor in attacks driven by an MO that doesn't appear to have changed much in the past ten years.

Critical Boot Loader Vulnerability in Shim Impacts Nearly All Linux Distros,"The maintainers of shim have released version 15.8 to address six security flaws, including a critical bug that could pave the way for remote code execution under specific circumstances.Tracked as CVE-2023-40547 (CVSS score: 9.8), the vulnerability could be exploited to achieve a Secure Boot bypass. Bill Demirkapi of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug.""The shim's http boot support (httpboot.c) trusts attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response, leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive,"" Oracle's Alan Coopersmith noted in a message shared on the Open Source Security mailing list oss-security.Demirkapi, in a post shared on X (formerly Twitter) late last month, said the vulnerability ""exists in every Linux boot loader signed in the past decade.""Firmware security firm Eclypsium said CVE-2023-40547 ""stems from HTTP protocol handling, leading to an out-of-bounds write that can lead to complete system compromise.""In a hypothetical attack scenario, a threat actor on the same network could leverage the flaw to load a vulnerable shim boot loader, or by a local adversary with adequate privileges to manipulate data on the EFI partition.""An attacker could perform a MiTM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack and intercept HTTP traffic between the victim and the HTTP server used to serve files to support HTTP boot,"" the company added. ""The attacker could be located on any network segment between the victim and the legitimate server.""That said, obtaining the ability to execute code during the boot process – which occurs before the main operating system starts – grants the attacker carte blanche access to deploy stealthy bootkits that can give near-total control over the compromised host.The five other vulnerabilities fixed in shim version 15.8 are below -- CVE-2023-40546 (CVSS score: 5.3) - Out-of-bounds read when printing error messages, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition- CVE-2023-40548 (CVSS score: 7.4) - Buffer overflow in shim when compiled for 32-bit processors that can lead to a crash or data integrity issues during the boot phase- CVE-2023-40549 (CVSS score: 5.5) - Out-of-bounds read in the authenticode function that could permit an attacker to trigger a DoS by providing a malformed binary- CVE-2023-40550 (CVSS score: 5.5) - Out-of-bounds read when validating Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) information that could result in information disclosure- CVE-2023-40551 (CVSS score: 7.1) - Out-of-bounds read when parsing MZ binaries, leading to a crash or possible exposure of sensitive data""An attacker exploiting this vulnerability gains control of the system before the kernel is loaded, which means they have privileged access and the ability to circumvent any controls implemented by the kernel and operating system,"" Eclypsium noted.",marketing,security updates and patches,FALSE
Managed Everything? Vendors Shift Focus to Services,"News, news analysis, and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology.Managed Everything? Vendors Shift Focus to ServicesMore companies are opting for managing complex security capabilities, such as data detection and response.February 7, 2024Threat management firm Rapid7 and data security firm Varonis announced new managed services this week, becoming the latest security companies to bundle complex security capabilities together in managed offerings.On Feb. 6, Rapid7 announced its Managed Digital Risk Protection (DRP) service. which will regularly scan the Internet and Dark Web for signs that attackers may be targeting a client's business. A day earlier, data security firm Varonis expanded its portfolio of products that monitor data access and detect potential breaches to offer a managed service to detect and respond to incidents. Varonis asserted that the service will focus on detecting potential ransomware and data breaches and responding within 30 minutes.""The way a lot of these data breaches actually happen is someone is able to compromise a regular user account, get a lot of data, and then exfiltrate that before anybody finds out,"" says Matthew Radolec, vice president of incident response and cloud operations at Varonis. ""Our entire value proposition is that we want to help ... reduce the amount of data any one person can get to and use detection and response on data to stop those problems.""Varonis coined a new name for the market segment the new service fits into: managed data detection and response (MDDR).Understanding New Market SegmentsOrganizations are increasingly consolidating their security vendors — in a September 2022 survey, three-quarters of companies said they have pursued vendor consolidation — and that is pushing vendors to differentiate themselves in the market. One way to accomplish that is by creating new market segments. For example, data loss prevention (DLP) as a segment has fragmented into data detection and response (DDR), data security posture management (DSPM), and insider risk management (IRM). Players in this market area include BigID, Cyberhaven, Dig Security, Laminar Technologies, and Sotero.Nearly every new category leads to a managed version, but one that often does not need to exist and ends up just making the cybersecurity more complex, says Jeff Pollard, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research.""We're creating a scenario for security leaders with all these various DRs [detection and response services], where, frankly, they're going to need to buy a tool per DR service,"" he says. ""Vendors that have a kind of siloed niche offering are trying to make it seem substantially more sophisticated than it is, when in reality what security leaders really need are tools, technologies, and providers that will work across the entirety of their detection surface.""Making Sense of Alphabet SoupIn many ways, managed detection and response (MDR) covers a lot of ground and, so far, has done well for vendors and their customers. Vendors have happy clients, exceptionally rapid growth rate, and a very high margin for the service, Pollard says. Meanwhile, businesses can focus on the threats, leading to faster detection and response. Focusing on the data could improve the response time, but that is far from certain.However, no matter what telemetry, data, or devices a detection and response service focuses on to detect threats, businesses just want to focus on outcomes — detecting threats and preventing compromises, says Eric Kokonas, vice president at Sophos.""The truth is that the best applications of MDR are the result — not of strict adherence to a defined set of tools, telemetry sources, and services — but of an adaptable range of human-led capabilities that can be delivered and consumed in ways that are most compatible with organizations' needs and that are most likely to achieve the organizations' desired outcomes,"" Kokonas says. ""Put more plainly, MDR services exist to achieve security and business outcomes the most optimal way possible.""Companies will likely adopt more managed services because security is growing more complex. Offering a managed version of an emerging security service will be an increasingly common approach, as the creation of an in-house cybersecurity capability is expensive, analyst firm Frost & Sullivan stated in its ""Global Managed Detection and Response Market"" report published in May 2022.""In light of the shortage of cybersecurity professionals, organizations are looking for ways to automate the process of threat detection and response,"" the report states. ""The new generation of solutions and services promises to deploy machine learning and artificial intelligence, automating decision-making to improve the overall performance of the security stack.""Data Out or Cloud InVaronis' MDDR service aims to help companies track their sensitive data and detect any potential misuse of, or threats to, that data. The service focuses on securing the business from the data outward. At the time of a breach, the most important thing is to identify whether an unauthorized user is accessing data and to block their activity, Radolec says.""Data is this soft and gooey and permeable layer of their security stack, and so we start with security around data, and not just alerting and detection response, but security posture is a big part of what we do,"" he says. ""So we help organizations reduce what we call the blast radius, or how much information can any person get to how many resources can a person get to.""Many other security technologies look to prevent unauthorized users and potential threats from getting into the network and stealing or deleting data — starting with the cloud and moving into securing devices, users and data in the network.Every company will likely have their own answer to questions about whether to center their security around protecting data, protecting devices, protecting identities, or protecting the cloud first, says Forrester's Pollard.The truth is that no matter the starting point, the goal is the same, he says.""The answer is you need a detection and response service that works across the entirety of your detection surface, that includes identities, that includes data, that includes cloud, and that includes applications,"" he says. ""It's about avoiding niche offerings that operate in one segment and treating your tech stack like it's a silo, instead of looking at and finding something that is much more holistic and comprehensive. Those services are available; they exist today.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Managed Everything?

Automate Routine Operational Workflows with Generative AI,"Cybersecurity insights from industry experts.Automate Routine Operational Workflows With Generative AIGenAI has the potential to revolutionize how organizations approach enterprise security, compliance, identity, and management processes.February 6, 2024When you think about your day-to-day responsibilities across security, compliance, identity, and management, how much of that work follows a repeatable process? How much more efficient could you be if those processes were automated through generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)?GenAI has the power to greatly streamline operational workflows and democratize knowledge across the entire security team, regardless of experience levels or knowledge about a specific technology or threat vector. Rather than having to manually research information on their own, SOC analysts can use natural language processing (NLP) embedded within GenAI models to ask questions and receive answers in a more natural format. NLP also gives GenAI the flexibility to ""understand"" what a user is asking and adapt to their style or preferences.However, it's important to recognize that GenAI is not intended to replace human expertise. Rather, it should help analysts respond to threats more efficiently by assisting them with guided recommendations and best practices based on the organization's own security data, known threat intelligence, and existing processes. Here's how.Establish Trust Through TransparencyBefore a security, compliance, identity, or management workflow can be automated, teams first need to be confident that all of the information at their disposal is complete and accurate. Routine back-end work is an ideal candidate for automation because it is both predictable and easily verified. Rather than having analysts spend their time responding to simple help-desk tickets or writing incident reports, why not leverage NLP and GenAI to automate those tasks? This way analysts can dedicate their time to more business-critical work.For this to work effectively, GenAI models must be transparent. Analysts should be able to understand the sources that the AI model pulled from and easily validate that information to ensure the AI is providing accurate recommendations.At Microsoft, we've defined, published, and implemented ethical principles to guide our AI work. And we've built out constantly improving engineering and governance systems to put these principles into practice. Transparency is one of the foundational principles of our Responsible AI framework, alongside fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, and accountability.How to Deploy GenAI in Your EnvironmentA number of repeatable, multistep processes across security, compliance, identity, and management are primed for automation.For example, when investigating incidents, analysts often have to examine scripts, command-line arguments, or suspicious files that may have been executed on an endpoint. Rather than manually researching this information, analysts can simply provide the script they observed and ask the AI model to break it down using a collection of prompts put together to accomplish specific security-related tasks. Each prompt book requires a specific input — for example, a code snippet or a threat actor name.The script is then explained step by step and the AI model is consulted to provide input as to whether the script may be malicious. From there, if any network indicator is present, it's correlated against threat intelligence and relevant results are summarized before being included. The AI can also provide recommendations based on the script actions and generate a report that summarizes the session for nontechnical audiences.Using AI this way provides two core benefits. First, the AI can automatically upskill users who may not understand the complexities of analyzing a script or file using a very transparent, repeatable process. Second, it saves time by having the model assist with common follow-up actions, such as correlating any indicators to threat intelligence and writing a summary report.Another GenAI use case is device management and compliance through conditional access policies. If devices don't meet specific policies, they are restricted from accessing company resources. This can lead to machines being locked out and users filing internal tickets to resolve the issue. In this scenario, IT operations or help-desk support staff can leverage NLP prompts to input the unique device identifier and quickly understand the compliance status of the device. The AI can then use NLP to explain why the device is noncompliant and provide step-by-step instructions on how to resolve the issue in the appropriate tool. This is powerful because someone without direct experience in a particular tool can now perform the task, avoiding the need to escalate.Ultimately, GenAI has the potential to completely revolutionize the way we approach enterprise security, compliance, identity, and management processes. By extending our thinking on how to apply GenAI in operational roles, we can save practitioners time, equip them with new skills, and ensure their time is spent on what matters most.— Read more Partner Perspectives from Microsoft SecurityRead more about:Partner PerspectivesAbout the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024",vulnerability reports,news and industry updates,FALSE
Microsoft Azure HDInsight Bugs Expose Big Data to Breaches,"February 6, 2024Three high-risk vulnerabilities have been uncovered in Microsoft Azure's big-data analytics service HDInsight.Four and a half months after disclosing eight cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the cloud data tool, Orca Security has published new findings involving one denial-of-service (DoS) and two privilege escalation bugs afflicting the same service.This new trio opens the door to performance issues and unauthorized administrative access, and all that comes with it: attackers reading, writing, deleting, and performing any other management operations over an organization's sensitive data.Three New Bugs in Azure HDInsightOne of the new escalation bugs affects Apache Ambari, an open source tool that simplifies Apache Hadoop cluster deployment, management, and monitoring.CVE-2023-38156, assigned a ""high"" 7.2 out of 10 score on the CVSS scale, concerns the URL endpoint associated with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), a Java application programming interface (API) responsible for defining how a client may access a database. By manipulating the JDBC endpoint, the researchers discovered they could successfully drop a reverse shell and escalate from regular user privileges to root access in a Hadoop cluster.The other two vulnerabilities relate to Apache Oozie, a workflow scheduler for Hadoop.The more serious of the two, CVE-2023-36419 is caused by a lack of proper user input validation, opening the door to XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks. An attacker exploiting XXE in the workflow scheduler could escalate privileges and read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. CVE-2023-36419 was assigned a ""high"" 8.8 CVSS score by Microsoft, but a ""critical"" 9.8 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) National Vulnerability Database (NVD).The other moderate-severity bug also derives from a lack of proper input validation, when a user requests logs for a specific job by specifying a very large range of actions, causing an intensive loop that the system can't handle. Doing so can slow down or outright freeze the Oozie dashboard, cause delays, failures, or other errors in scheduling and managing Oozie jobs, and cause performance degradation to other services on the same host.Why Azure HDInsight Vulnerabilities MatterData processing tools in an organizational setting can house massive troves of valuable information.""HDInsight is used to perform analysis on 'Big Data,' meaning large amounts of structured, unstructured, and fast-moving data,"" explains Bar Kaduri, research team leader at Orca Security. ""Typically, it’' the larger organizations who are using big data analytics to identify new business opportunities and facilitate strategic decisions.""Indeed, some of the world's largest corporations — including Unilever, MetLife, Ernst & Young, and more, according to business data aggregators — make use of Azure HDInsight.""We can safely assume that this big data is likely to contain valuable and confidential customer and market information which organizations would want to do their utmost to protect,"" Kaduri says, emphasizing the need for organizations to patch diligently as new security gaps rise to the surface.All three of the new bugs were fixed as of Oct. 26. HDInsight users are recommended to implement Microsoft's latest patch if they haven't already, with one caveat: The service does not support in-place upgrades.To properly protect their applications, HDInsight users must create a cluster with the latest platform version and updates, then migrate the old to the new.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
UAE Cybersecurity Official Warns of VPN Abuse,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.UAE Cybersecurity Official Warns of VPN AbuseMore than 6 million VPNs are now deployed on devices in the United Arab Emirates.February 6, 2024The top cyber official in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) worries that virtual private networks (VPNs) are being misused in the country.""We have no problem with people using VPNs, but using it for bad things is the problem,"" Muhammad Al Kuwaiti, head of cybersecurity at UAE Government, recently told local reporters.UAE residents increased their downloads of VPN apps by 1.83 million in 2023, reaching a total of 6.1 million, according to the Global VPN Adoption Index by Atlas VPN.This pushed the UAE VPN adoption rate to 61.7% last year, the second highest in the world after Qatar’s 69.87%.Strict Regulations and CensorshipVPN usage in the UAE is high because the country set strict regulations on Internet content, including the censorship of designated websites and online services, says Ezzeldin Hussein, regional director, sales engineering, Middle East, Turkey and Africa (META), SentinelOne.""VPNs allow users to bypass these restrictions and access content that may be blocked or unavailable in the country, such as VoIP services,"" Hussein explains.He added that the UAE is a global commerce hub, so visiting business travelers often use VPNs to access corporate networks, communicate securely abroad, and overcome geo-restrictions on services and content.Individuals in the UAE also turn to VPNs to encrypt their Internet traffic and protect their personal information from surveillance, hacking, and data breaches, he notes.VPNs for WhatsApp, FaceTime AccessNord Security says the usage of VPN is growing in the UAE and wider Gulf as residents use it make audio-video calls through apps such as WhatsApp, Skype, FaceTime, and dating apps.However, the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA) guidelines clearly forbids the use of VPNs for illegal means, including hiding an IP address to gain access to forbidden communications sites, such as WhatsApp — which is seen to be a rival to the government's incumbent VoIP services.Under the decree law to combat false rumors (or fake news) and cybercrimes, UAE residents who violate the law and misuse VPNs could face imprisonment and fines between Dh500,000 to Dh2 million.Gopan Sivasankaran, general manager at Secureworks for Middle East, Turkey, and Africa, says the UAE is home to a large percentage of expat workers who may be tempted to employ VPNs to access media content from their home country, or call international friends and family.Aside from the legal risks, Sivasankaran warns of consumer complacency surrounding VPN's unique cybersecurity risks.""In the same way that the cloud is sometimes dismissed as 'somebody else's computer,' third-party VPN services are 'somebody else's network.' They will protect your local traffic on a hotel or public WiFi network but that protection ends at the VPN service provider's server,"" he says. Rogue providers could potentially monetize, monitor, or interfere with VPN traffic, he adds.""The customer takes it on trust that nothing nefarious is done with their communications.""Cybercrime Investigation ChallengesFrom a national cybersecurity perspective, widespread VPN usage poses challenges for law enforcement and intelligence agencies tasked with monitoring cybercrime and national security threats, cautions SentinelOne's Hussein.""The anonymity afforded by VPNs can make it difficult to trace the origin of malicious activities or identify individuals involved in cyberattacks or other illicit activities conducted online,"" he says.""Ultimately, governments will face policy and regulatory challenges in balancing the need to protect cybersecurity with respecting individual privacy rights and freedom,"" Hussein adds.

Crucial Airline Flight Planning App Open to Interception Risks,"February 6, 2024A mobile app that many airline pilots use for crucial flight planning purposes was open to attacks that could have interfered with safe takeoff and landing procedures due to a disabled security feature it contained.NAVBLUE, an Airbus-owned IT services company that developed the app, fixed the issue last year after researchers at UK-based Pen Test Partners (PTP) informed the company about the issue.And this week, PTP released details of its findings following Airbus' successful remediation of the application.Electronic Flight Bag AppsThe vulnerability was present in Flysmart+ Manager, an app that is part of a broader suite of Flysmart+ apps for so-called Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) platforms. An EFB device — usually an iPad or other tablet computer — basically hosts apps that flight crews use for flight planning calculations and for accessing a variety of digital documents such as operating manuals, navigational charts, and aircraft checklists. Some EFBs are directly integrated into the avionics systems of modern aircraft and provide an array of other more complex features, such as providing real-time weather information and tracking the aircraft's position on navigational systems.Flysmart+ specifically is a suite of iOS apps that assists with aircraft performance, weight, and balance-related calculations according to NAVBLUE. It can be fully integrated with Airbus' standard operating procedures, can be used during all phases of a flight, and provides pilots with access to a range of avionics parameters. Flysmart+ Manager, the app in which Pen Test Partners found the security issue, is an app that enables synchronization of data across the Flysmart+ suite.Disabled Security SettingResearchers from Pen Test Partners found that an App Transport Security (ATS) feature in Flysmart+ Manager that would have forced the app to use HTTPS had not been enabled. The app did not have any form of certificate validation either, leaving it exposed to interception on open and untrusted networks. ""An attacker could use this weakness to intercept and decrypt potentially sensitive information in transit,"" PTP said in its report this week.Ken Munro, a partner at the pen testing firm, says the biggest concern had to do with the potential for attacks on the app that could cause so called runway excursions — or veer-offs and overruns — and potential tail strikes on takeoff. ""The EFB is used to calculate the required power from the engines for departure, also the required braking on landing,"" Munro says. ""We showed that, as a result of the missing ATS setting, one could potentially tamper with the data that is then given to pilots. That data is used during these 'performance' calculations, so pilots could apply insufficient power or not enough braking action,"" he says.The ATS issue in Flysmart+ Manager is just one of several vulnerabilities that PTP has uncovered in EFBs in recent years. In May 2023, for instance, the firm reported an integrity check bypass flaw in a Lufthansa EFB app called Lido eRouteManual that gave attackers a way to modify flight planning data that pilots using the app received. In July 2022, researchers at PTP showed how they could modify manuals on an EFB pertaining to the effectiveness of de-icing procedures on aircraft wings.Hard to ExploitFrom a practical standpoint the disabled ATS setting issue that PTP identified in the Airbus EFB was not especially easy to exploit. To pull it off, an attacker would have first needed to be within Wi-Fi range of an EFB with the vulnerable app. More significantly, the attack would have been possible only during an app update — meaning the threat actor would need to know when the update was happening so they could insert their malicious code during the process.According to PTP, those conditions can occur during pilot layovers. ""Airline EFBs can be exposed to interception on untrusted networks given pilot layover hotels are well known and used consistently each night,"" the firm said.Pilots usually bring their EFBs with them during layovers because the devices contain their electronic roster as well, Munro says. So, if an attacker was within Wi-Fi range of the device at a hotel they could potentially initiate an attack. ""Missing ATS would allow a man-in-the-middle attack over Wi-Fi, at which point the attacker could push a tampered database update to the EFB,"" he says.While an attack can only happen during an app update, such updates need to happen on a regular basis, he adds. That improves the odds for a successful attack, Munro notes. ""A quirk of the aviation industry means that the software MUST be updated once every 30 days to remain legal,"" he says. ""Given airport layover hotels are known and numerous pilots will be staying at each one every night, the odds and practicality start to add up.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",vulnerability reports,vulnerability reports,TRUE
"Experts Detail New Flaws in Azure HDInsight Spark, Kafka, and Hadoop Services","Three new security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Azure HDInsight's Apache Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark services that could be exploited to achieve privilege escalation and a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) condition.""The new vulnerabilities affect any authenticated user of Azure HDInsight services such as Apache Ambari and Apache Oozie,"" Orca security researcher Lidor Ben Shitrit said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.The list of flaws is as follows -- CVE-2023-36419 (CVSS score: 8.8) - Azure HDInsight Apache Oozie Workflow Scheduler XML External Entity (XXE) Injection Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability- CVE-2023-38156 (CVSS score: 7.2) - Azure HDInsight Apache Ambari Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) Injection Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability- Azure HDInsight Apache Oozie Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) Vulnerability (no CVE)The two privilege escalation flaws could be exploited by an authenticated attacker with access to the target HDI cluster to send a specially crafted network request and gain cluster administrator privileges.The XXE flaw is the result of a lack of user input validation that allows for root-level file reading and privilege escalation, while the JDBC injection flaw could be weaponized to obtain a reverse shell as root.""The ReDoS vulnerability on Apache Oozie was caused by a lack of proper input validation and constraint enforcement, and allowed an attacker to request a large range of action IDs and cause an intensive loop operation, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS),"" Ben Shitrit explained.Successful exploitation of the ReDoS vulnerability could result in a disruption of the system's operations, cause performance degradation, and negatively impact both the availability and reliability of the service.Following responsible disclosure, Microsoft has rolled out fixes as part of updates released on October 26, 2023.The development arrives nearly five months after Orca detailed a collection of eight flaws in the open-source analytics service that could be exploited for data access, session hijacking, and delivering malicious payloads.In December 2023, Orca also highlighted a ""potential abuse risk"" impacting Google Cloud Dataproc clusters that take advantage of a lack of security controls in Apache Hadoop's web interfaces and default settings when creating resources to access any data on the Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) without any authentication.",news and industry updates,vulnerability reports,FALSE
Infosec pros sound off on usefulness of higher education,"Half of polled infosec pros say their degree was less than useful for real-world workThe other half paid attention in class?Half of infosec professionals polled by Kaspersky said any cybersecurity knowledge they picked up from their higher education is at best somewhat useful for doing their day jobs. On the other hand, half said the know-how was at least very useful. We're a glass half-empty lot.The Moscow-headquartered multinational revealed those figures today in the first part of a multi-stage report based on a survey of 1,012 infosec professionals across 29 countries.About a quarter of those probed said their higher education was ""not at all useful"" for their working life in cybersecurity; 12 percent said it was ""slightly useful;"" and 14 percent described it as ""somewhat useful,"" adding up to 50 percent for the negatives. On the flip side, 29 percent said their education was ""extremely"" useful, and 21 percent said ""very"" useful.Here's what Kaspersky had to say about that:The lack of teaching personnel with real-world experience in the cybersecurity might be one of the biggest reasons explaining traditional education’s detachment from the industry and respondents hesitating to call their formal studies useful.Or it might be that they took the wrong course, or didn't pay attention, but that's just our opinion. And we should include this part from Kaspersky's report to give you more context:Of the infosec professionals with two to five years’ experience, just 19 percent feel their formal education was extremely useful or very useful in their day-to-day work, while three-quarters of these young professionals say the theoretical knowledge they got was not useful in helping them fulfil their responsibilities. However, this trend is skewed towards mid and senior level professionals.If you were wondering what subjects these industry professionals studied – for instance, it's no surprise that someone taking physics found that less than useful for IT security – we pondered that, too. Kaspersky said 36 percent of those polled said the highest-level of education they got was in engineering, 21 percent said information technology, 15 percent said computer science, 13 percent said business management, 10 percent said science, and three percent said mathematics or something else.We're told 43 percent of the polled cybersecurity professionals actually studied information security as part of their official curriculum. Which perhaps better explains the above 50-50 split on usefulness.Keep upThere is another possible angle here. Security technology — and tech in general — moves fast and becomes ""legacy"" in one or two years, it's believed.""If you are studying for a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, for instance, you are preparing for a four-year course,"" said one survey respondent who works as a bank CIO in Brazil. ""But in those four years the tech has advanced so much that the knowledge you acquired in the first or second year is already outdated in your third or fourth years of study.""As mentioned above, an overall skills gap in the IT security industry may have caused or is fueling a shortage of qualified instructors who have practical industry experience as opposed to theoretical knowledge. Without those educators, graduates may feel the knowledge they gained is less than useful in the real world.Almost 40 percent of the polled infosec professionals worldwide said they ""somewhat disagree,"" ""disagree,"" or ""strongly disagree"" that their college or university professors had real-world experience. Breaking that down: 32 percent of North American respondents said they disagreed their tutors had real-life experience; 35 percent for Europe; and 37 percent for the Asia-Pacific region.- Wait, security courses aren't a requirement to graduate with a computer science degree?- Infosec pros can secure IT, but have harder time securing job satisfaction- Ransomware attacks hospitalizing security pros, as one admits suicidal feelings- Infosec still (mostly) a boys clubThe regions with the smallest number of academic instructors with industry experience are in Russia (42 percent of respondents in that region disagreed their tutors had outside experience) and the Middle East, Turkey and Africa (48 percent).Latin America seemed to have the highest report with only 20 percent of people surveyed disagreeing that their professors had practical experience in the field.Overall, half of the respondents rated the availability of infosec courses in higher education institutions as poor (27 percent) or very poor (23 percent), and this number jumped to 83 percent for professionals with between two and five work experience under their belt.According to one professional from the US: ""There was no such thing as handling real-life situations, it was simulating real security incidents and learning to respond effectively. So this was missing from the educational programs. Handling actual security incidents requires a different set of skills than theoretical knowledge alone."" ®",news and industry updates,vulnerability reports,FALSE
New Report From Flare Highlights Pervasive Threat of Initial Access Brokers in NATO Countries,"February 7, 2024PRESS RELEASEMontreal, Quebec, Canada – February 6, 2024 – Flare, the leading Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) solution provider, has released a new report that explores and analyzes the cyber threat landscape and threats to NATO countries created by initial access brokers (IABs) on Russian-language hacking forums.IABs are key players in the cybercrime landscape. They infiltrate systems and gain unauthorized access through various techniques, including spear-phishing, exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, and leveraging leaked and stolen credentials, with the primary goal of establishing persistence in these environments.For this report, Flare analyzed hundreds of IAB posts on the Russian-language hacking forums, and discovered recent activity in 21 out of the 31 NATO countries - confirming the extensive reach and consistent potential threat IABs pose to national security and economic stability.One of the key findings of the report is the threat actors' preference for targeting critical infrastructure sectors in NATO member states - their strategic value allowing IABs to demand higher prices in the cybercrime market. The report also highlights the anonymized nature of IAB posts and the careful efforts of threat actors to conceal sensitive details, which poses challenges in identifying victims.The analysis indicates a clear trend toward targeted cyberattacks on the US defense sector, and a higher price point for access to US defense contractors. This reflects the high value of these targets and suggests that threat actors recognize the significant impact of infiltrating defense-related systems.""Geopolitics are no longer isolated from cybercrime,"" said Eric Clay, VP Marketing at Flare. ""As global tensions have increased we’ve seen a spillover where nation-states may directly leverage cybercrime groups to further their aims.""To better understand the IAB threat landscape targeting entities in NATO member states, Flare presents a snapshot of recent IAB sales from the Exploit forum in the report. These sales, involving entities in 21 NATO countries and primarily from the years 2023 and 2024, represent just a small sample of the multitude of IAB listings.To explore this research and the significant impact of IABs gaining unauthorized access to the sensitive information of NATO member states, please read the full report at https://flare.io/learn/resources/initial-access-broker-landscape-in-nato-member-states-on-exploit-forum/.About FlareFlare provides the Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) solution for organizations.

Spyware business booming despite government crackdowns,"The spyware business is booming despite government crackdowns'Almost zero data being shared across the industry on this particular threat,' we're toldUpdated The commercial spyware economy – despite government and big tech's efforts to crack down – appears to be booming.In addition to the major players like Pegasus developer NSO Group, and Predator maker Intellexa, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has found ""dozens of smaller"" commercial surveillance vendors and tracks around 40 such organizations.Other exploitation supply chain orgs also make money from these nefarious tools – from the initial exploit developers and suppliers on through to the spyware vendors that charge varying amounts depending on what capabilities the customer requests.In 2023, TAG reports it uncovered 25 zero-days under active exploitation, and 20 of these were abused by commercial surveillance vendors.""All these players enable the proliferation of dangerous tools and capabilities used by governments against individuals, which threatens the safety of the internet ecosystem and the trust on which a vibrant and inclusive digital society depends,"" according to a TAG report published on Tuesday.The safety of the internet is not the only thing at stake as a result of spyware vendors’ efforts: the report shares stories of victims such as human rights advocates and journalists whose devices were infected with Pegasus.These tools have also been used to secure the detention of political dissidents, lawyers, journalists and activists. Some deployments of spyware have been blamed for victims’ deaths. This, despite assurances from some of the surveillance vendors that their products can only be sold to governments and used to fight terrorism and other serious crimes.""I have yet to see any reporting on legitimate use of this software,"" Cisco Talos head of outreach Nick Biasini lamented in an interview with The Register.""That's not to say that it doesn't exist,"" he added. ""It could be used in highly classified environments so that information never sees the light of day. But the majority of the activity seems to be around dissidents, activists, reporters, lawyers and those types of victims, which implies a non-standard application of the technology.""Government to the rescue?Western governments are taking steps to curb this $12-billion-a-year industry. On Monday, the US announced it would impose visa restrictions on anyone involved in the abuse of commercial spyware. Presumably, this extends from the makers and suppliers all the way to end-users.That action follows last year's executive order banning the US government's use of commercial spyware that presents a national security risk to America – although, as The Register pointed out at the time, the order includes big loopholes for Uncle Sam's snoops and American-made products.On Tuesday, a group of 35 nations, led by the UK and France, signed an agreement to ""tackle proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber intrusion tools and services."" Tech giants including Apple, Google and Microsoft also reportedly participated, but declined to comment.Despite these and other efforts, the spyware business ""appears to be booming,"" Biasini observed. ""There's a lot of growth. If you look at the offensive conferences – especially the ones in Europe that have been going on – there are just a deluge of vendors that sit in this space.""The spyware economyOne of the ""bigger trends"" that Talos is tracking within the spyware economy is the ""decoupling between the commercial spyware vendors and the vulnerability and exploit vendors,"" Biasini added.According to TAG, spyware users typically use exploit chains, rather than a single point of entry, to remotely drop spyware to the target's devices. This usually includes three or four zero-days, the report indicates. The findings don't include any pricing info for these zero-days – which tend to allow remote code execution, sandbox escape and local privilege escalation.The TAG report does include some details on spyware vendors' pricing models – but nothing new.One is a widely sourced 2021 New York Times publication of a pitch document for Predator. The base price of €8 million ($8.6 million) buys the user a remote, one-click exploit chain to install spyware implants on Android and iOS devices and the ability to run ten concurrent implants. Intellexa provides project management, and a 12-month warranty on the contract.The second is an offer for NOVA – an Intellexa Alliance combined spyware and data analysis system that was leaked on the XSS.is cybercrime forum in 2022. In addition to the base price, users can buy persistence on victim devices for an extra €3 million ($3.2 million), and an additional five-country package for another €1.2 million ($1.3 million).- US judge rejects spyware slinger NSO's attempt to bin Apple lawsuit- Kaspersky reveals previously unknown hardware 'feature' exploited in iPhone attacks- Think tank report labels NSO, Lazarus as 'cyber mercenaries'- US Commerce Dept pinky swears it won't push American spyware on world-plus-dogWhen asked about these pricing models, and what Talos has seen, Biasini explained the NYT story and the XXS leak are the only two data points he's aware of. ""We are basically operating on two leaked pieces of data,"" he noted. ""That's all we have.""This illustrates another part of the problem: the spyware economy remains mysterious.""There is almost zero data being shared across the industry on this particular threat, and that is a massive problem,"" Biasini worried. ""If we really want to fix this, we need more eyes on this – not less. As someone who operates in the tech space, it is a Herculean effort for us to get samples to be able to analyze, and that should not be the case.""In addition to samples of the malware itself, investigators need indicators of compromise, and hashes – things that are lacking in spyware reports. Similarly, none of the sources The Register contacted for this story could, or would, provide us with any other examples of or information about spyware pricing models.All of this contributes to a lack of visibility, which allows the miscreants abusing surveillance tools to operate with impunity while their victims live in fear. ®Updated to add""The recent UK Pall Mall Process highlights a growing international alarm over the global spyware crisis,"" Elina Castillo Jiménez, advocacy coordinator at the security lab at Amnesty Tech told The Register.""While a positive step, the declaration is far short of what is needed to rein in the commercial surveillance industry. States must adopt a ban on highly intrusive spyware altogether and establish robust safeguards for any permissible use of other forms of spyware.""International law already defines legitimate spyware applications narrowly; instead of debating this, the focus must shift to protecting individuals from unlawful surveillance. Furthermore – there is a lot that can be done by governments individually – including through ceasing to purchase products from commercial surveillance vendors, enforcing export regulations, and providing accountability for already documented victims of spyware.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
China's Cyberattackers Maneuver to Disrupt US Critical Infrastructure,"Lurking for 5 years, Volt Typhoon is positioning itself to physically disrupt and cripple US critical infrastructure by gaining access to operational technology networks in the energy, water, communications, and transportation sectors, according to CISA.February 7, 2024The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a report detailing how the China-backed Volt Typhoon advanced persistent threat (APT) is consistently targeting highly sensitive critical infrastructure, with new information on the cyberattackers' pivot to operational technology (OT) networks once they've burrowed inside.Given that the OT network is responsible for the physical functions of industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) equipment, the findings clearly corroborate the ongoing suspicion that Chinese hackers are looking to be able to disrupt critical physical operations in energy, water utilities, communications, and transportation, presumably to cause panic and discord in the event of a kinetic conflagration between the US and China.""Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions,"" according to CISA's Volt Typhoon advisory. [We] ""are concerned about the potential for these actors to use their network access for disruptive effects in the event of potential geopolitical tensions and/or military conflicts.""It's an important set of revelations, according to John Hultquist, chief analyst at Mandiant Intelligence/Google Cloud.""Previously, we could deduce from targeting that the actor had a strong interest in critical infrastructure that had little intelligence value,"" he said in an emailed analysis. But the CISA report shows that ""Volt Typhoon is gathering information on, and even penetrating, OT systems — the highly sensitive systems that run the physical processes at the heart of critical infrastructure,"" he added. ""Under the right conditions, OT systems could be manipulated to cause major shutdowns of essential services, or even to create dangerous conditions.""Hultquist added, ""If there was any skepticism as to why this actor is carrying out these intrusions, this revelation should put it to rest.""Living Off the Land & Hiding for 5 YearsCISA also revealed today that Volt Typhoon (aka Vanguard Panda, Bronze Silhouette, Dev-0391, UNC3236, Voltzite, and Insidious Taurus) has secretly hidden in US infrastructure for half a decade — even though they were first publicly outed by Microsoft only last year.""Unlike ransomware operators whose goal is to get in and cause damage quickly, this nation-state operator is leveraging valid accounts and 'living off the land' [LOTL] techniques to evade detection for long periods of time,"" Ken Westin, field CISO at Panther Lab, said in an emailed comment. ""These methods allow the group to monitor their targets and provide a foothold to cause kinetic damage.""To boot, the APT ""also relies on valid accounts and leverage[s] strong operational security, which ... allows for long-term undiscovered persistence,"" CISA explained. ""Volt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre-exploitation reconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment; tailor their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the victim's environment; and dedicate ongoing resources to maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time, even after initial compromise.""While Volt Typhoon's strategy of staying hidden by using legitimate utilities and blending in with normal traffic isn't a new phenomenon in cybercrime, it does make it difficult for potential targets to actively scan for malicious activity, according to CISA, which issued extensive LOTL guidance today for doing just that.Meanwhile, an infrastructure update, while it could in some cases require a costly and labor-intensive forklift replacement, might not go awry either.""Many of the OT environments being targeted are notorious for running outdated software, either out of negligence or necessity, if the systems cannot be updated, which increases the risk posed by this threat,"" Westin said.Worryingly, CISA also noted that the danger extends beyond the US. Last month, SecurityScorecard's STRIKE team identified new infrastructure linked to Volt Typhoon that indicated the APT was also targeting Australian and UK government assets. The CISA report broadens that risk to also include Canada and New Zealand — all of these US partners' infrastructure is also susceptible to nation-state actors, it warned.CISA's advisory comes on the heels of a government action to disrupt the group's small office/home office (SOHO) router botnet, which it used to throw off those tracking its activity. In a bit of good news, according to researchers at Lumen's Black Lotus Labs this week, the group has so far failed to revive the botnet.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
"As Smart Cities Expand, So Do the Threats","Cybersecurity In-Depth: Feature articles on security strategy, latest trends, and people to know.As Smart Cities Expand, So Do the ThreatsThe systems that make up a smart city ecosystem are not easily secured and require better design and better policy to ensure they are not vulnerable.February 6, 2024For technologists, building smart cities is not an aspirational goal but a matter of necessity. The World Bank estimates that 70% of the world's population will be living in urban areas by 2050, up from 56% today. This massive population shift will place increasing pressure on city infrastructure and technology used to manage urban areas. Increased automation will also bring new threats.While the concept of a smart city may seem monolithic, in reality it is a collection of independent technologies and systems communicating with each other and a central management hub, creating a diverse ecosystem of technologies — one that needs to be well secured, says Piyush Pandey, the US cyber data market leader at business consultancy Deloitte. In many cases, those technologies have not been adequately secured individually, let alone as an interdependent ecosystem exposed to the public, he says.""This is obviously not just one system that needs to be secure. ... With this smart ecosystem and the massive number of interconnections, we are consciously allowing our network to be exposed,"" Pandey says. ""The security is not really limited to applying some sort of a firewall or physical security at the device level. We have to look at this in a holistic fashion.""A number of countries are pursuing the concept of smart cities, from governments in the Middle East and Africa to Singapore's claim as the smartest city in the world. A city can collect more than 500 million events per day from its diverse array of systems — smart electric meters, street lights, transportation monitors, and emergency management systems — according to a recent Deloitte report on securing smart ecosystems. While the convergence of information technology (IT), operational technology (OT), the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation will lead to increased efficiency, the smarts of a smart city will also result in a greater vulnerability to threats.Ransomware has become a major issue for local governments, and the increasing automation of cities adds to the operational challenges, with concerns that ransomware could shut down civic operations.A Trio of Risk DriversFrom intelligent transportation systems, to smart electrical grids, to just-in-time critical infrastructure, smart city systems link a vast pool of devices — many with no built-in security features of their own — to untrusted systems, such as smartphones, legacy technologies, and desktops running out-of-date software. The three most vulnerable and impactful systems are those used for emergency alerts, street video surveillance, and smart traffic lights, according to a 2020 survey of smart-city security experts conducted by UC Berkeley's Center for Long Term Cybersecurity (CLTC).Many of those systems were put in place without much consideration for cybersecurity, says Rowland Herbert-Faulkner, graduate researcher in city and regional planning affiliated with CLTC.""We don't have built-in product security for a lot of things, and if we don't put that in place, then we are still broadening the threat landscape. The risks go up exponentially,"" he says. ""That's something that's come up in research for quite a while: How do we deal with product security, especially when we're dealing with these interconnected systems? Especially when someone's device can be used as an attack vector or as an entry point into the system.""Three main factors — convergence, interoperability, and integration — drive risks in smart city ecosystems, according to Deloitte's report. The marriage of cyber and physical systems — convergence — allows one domain to affect the other, dramatically increasing the attack surface. Devices from different systems — some old, and some new — interoperate with one another, putting old systems that were never intended to be connected at risk. Finally, the tight integration of devices across systems means that an attack can quickly impact other systems, creating a cascading of impacts.""Not only are the boundaries blurred because there are no organizational boundaries in a smart ecosystem, there are no system boundaries because now we are talking about the cyber and physical convergence,"" says Deloitte's Pandey. ""We have multiple different vendors coming into play with different devices and disparate systems that have varying degrees of security controls, so now when they are interconnected, the weakest system [becomes] the problem.""Smart Device Security: A 20-Year ProblemThe different systems vary by purpose — smart license-plate readers have a different architecture than the smart electrical grid — and also by protocols. While they are likely to communicate over wireless technologies, they also are likely to talk to each other through centralized hubs. Most devices cannot run security agents because such add-on security would cause too great of a performance hit for many programmable logic controllers, IoT devices, and other low-power hardware, says Tom Pace, CEO of XIoT security firm NetRise.""It'll probably get there, but that's like a 20-year problem,"" he says. ""What you really need to do is have most of these device manufacturers standardize on some operating system and processor architecture. Otherwise, you're asking companies to create like 1,000 different agents that need to be installed. It's just never going to work.""In addition to the technology aspects of the problem, a great deal of cybersecurity expertise still needs to be developed to tackle smart cities. Improving the cybersecurity posture for smart cities is critical, says UC Berkeley's Herbert-Faulkner. Because of the impact of ransomware on local government agencies, cyber insurers have pulled back from issuing policies, for example, and have become much more stringent.""Cyber insurers are not too interested in covering cities because a lot of local government personnel don't have the basics down — they don't have a framework in place that's going to help them mitigate this risk,"" he says. ""Bringing city and local government personnel up to speed in terms of basic cyber hygiene is going to be critical, and we see this particularly when you're talking about risk mitigation.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Why Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingFeb 8, 2024|5 Min ReadAs Smart Cities Expand, So Do the ThreatsFeb 6, 2024|5 Min ReadName That Edge Toon: The Great EscapeFeb 5, 2024|1 Min ReadA Cyber Insurer's Perspective on How to Avoid RansomwareJan 29, 2024|5 Min Read",marketing,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

U.S. Imposes Visa Restrictions on those Involved in Illegal Spyware Surveillance,"The U.S. State Department said it's implementing a new policy that imposes visa restrictions on individuals who are linked to the illegal use of commercial spyware to surveil civil society members.""The misuse of commercial spyware threatens privacy and freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. ""Such targeting has been linked to arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings in the most egregious of cases.""The latest measures, underscoring continued efforts on part of the U.S. government to curtail the proliferation of surveillance tools, are designed to ""promote accountability"" for individuals involved in commercial spyware misuse.The new policy covers people who have used such tools to ""unlawfully surveil, harass, suppress, or intimidate individuals,"" as well as those who stand to financially benefit from the misuse.It also includes the companies (aka private sector offensive actors or PSOAs) that develop and sell the spyware to governments and other entities. It's currently not clear how the new restrictions will be enforced for individuals who possess passports that don't require a visa to enter the U.S.However, CyberScoop notes that executives potentially affected by the ban would no longer be eligible to participate in the visa waiver program, and that they would need to apply for a visa to travel to the U.S.The development comes days after Access Now and the Citizen Lab revealed that 35 journalists, lawyers, and human-rights activists in the Middle Eastern nation of Jordan were targeted with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware.In November 2021, the U.S. government sanctioned NSO Group and Candiru, another spyware vendor, for developing and supplying cyber weapons to foreign governments that ""used these tools to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers.""Then early last year, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order barring federal government agencies from using commercial spyware that could pose national security risks. In July 2023, the U.S. also placed Intellexa and Cytrox on a trade blocklist.According to an intelligence assessment released by the U.K. Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in April 2023, at least 80 countries have purchased commercial cyber intrusion software over the past decade.Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), in a comprehensive report about the commercial spyware landscape shared with The Hacker News, said there are dozens of smaller vendors such as Cy4Gate, Negg Group, and Variston who ""enable the proliferation of dangerous tools and capabilities used by governments against individuals.""For example, Italian company Cy4Gate, which acquired RCS Lab in March 2022, is the maker of Android and iOS spyware known as Epeius. Negg Group, which is also from Italy, develops a strain of mobile spyware codenamed VBiss that's delivered via one-click exploit chains. It has also been linked to another Android malware known as Skygofree.""If governments ever had a monopoly on the most sophisticated capabilities, that era is certainly over,"" TAG said, adding it's tracking nearly 40 companies with varying levels of sophistication. ""The private sector is now responsible for a significant portion of the most sophisticated tools we detect.""This is exemplified by the fact that of the 25 zero-days that were exploited in the wild in 2023, 20 were weaponized by PSOAs. Furthermore, 35 out of 72 zero-days found in Google products since 2014 have been actively exploited by commercial vendors.""The development of surveillance technology often begins with the discovery of a vulnerability and ends with a government customer collecting data from spyware installed on a high risk user's device,"" TAG further noted, calling out the roles played by exploit developers, exploit brokers, and the vendors themselves, who sell the spyware as a product along with the initial delivery mechanisms and the exploits.(The story was updated after publication to include additional insights shared by Google's Threat Analysis Group.)",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE
It's not just Volt Typhoon lurking in critical US orgs' IT,"Volt Typhoon not the only Chinese crew lurking in US energy, critical networksPresumably American TLAs are all over Beijing's infrastructure, too ... right?Volt Typhoon isn't the only Chinese spying crew infiltrating computer networks in America's energy sector and other critical organizations with the aim of wrecking equipment and causing other headaches, the US government has said.This warning came within hours of Uncle Sam earlier today confirming Volt Typhoon had compromised ""multiple"" IT environments across communications, energy, transportation, water, and wastewater processing sectors in the United States. American officials said China's cyberspies were able to avoid detection and snoop around those networks, in some cases for up to five years. There is a fear that President Xi has instructed agents to sneak into America's key civil systems, and lay in wait to steal data and trigger disruption to vital services and supply lines as needed.Volt Typhoon is certainly not the only Chinese group conducting this type of activity""This stealthy access increases our concern that they are lurking, waiting for the right moment to cause devastating impact,"" said Cynthia Kaiser, deputy assistant director for the FBI's cybersecurity division, on a call with journalists Wednesday afternoon.The Chinese snoops were seeking access to and information about organizations' operational technology to either position themselves for or gain vital information about these OT systems for future cyberattacks, she added.Last week, the FBI said it obtained search warrants and issued a remote kill command to wipe Volt Typhoon's botnet after the gang infected hundreds of end-of-life routers with backdoor malware to break into critical infrastructure networks.""But perhaps even more concerning is that Volt Typhoon is certainly not the only Chinese group conducting this type of activity,"" Kaiser noted. She declined to identify the other Beijing-backed gangs that have been found burrowing into US critical infrastructure.The US Department of Energy's Mara Winn echoed this assessment, and noted that DoE has been working with energy system owners and operators ""over the last several months"" to detect compromised systems and stamp out the intruders.""Our assessment is that the threat is actively positioning itself on critical infrastructure IT networks with the explicit goal of being able to disrupt the functioning of operational technology,"" said Winn, the deputy director for preparedness, policy, and risk assessment in the DOE's Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response.- US says China's Volt Typhoon is readying destructive cyberattacks- FBI confirms it issued remote kill command to blow out Volt Typhoon's botnet- Is critical infrastructure prepared for OT ransomware?- We know nations are going after critical systems, but what happens when crims join in?In the Feds' Wednesday warning, officials emphasized the importance of identity management for critical infrastructure owners and operators. This includes implementing phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA).""What we see is these actors stealing administrative credentials and using those credentials to maintain persistent access to the network,"" CISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Eric Goldstein said on the call with reporters.OT systems could be manipulated to cause major shutdowns of essential services""Those credentials allow the PRC to conduct any activity that those administrators would be able to conduct on the network, whether that's deleting information off the network, whether the changing credentials for other users or other kinds of activities,"" he added.This is especially concerning given Volt Typhoon's interest in OT systems, according to John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google Cloud's Mandiant Intelligence. ""OT systems could be manipulated to cause major shutdowns of essential services, or even to create dangerous conditions,"" he told The Register.""Evidence of forays into OT systems justify our concerns that the actor is a serious threat,"" Hultquist added. ""If there was any skepticism as to why this actor was carrying out these intrusions, this revelation should put it to rest.""Presumably the concept of infiltrating and backdooring foreign critical infrastructure just in case has not escaped the bright minds at the Pentagon either. ®",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE
Microsoft Adds Face Check to Entra Verified ID,"News, news analysis, and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology.Microsoft Adds Face Check to Entra Verified IDMicrosoft has released the public preview of Face Check, which detects a person's ""liveness"" and compares their appearance against existing documents, such as a driver’s license, to verify identity.February 7, 2024Microsoft has added facial matching to its Entra Verified ID service, which lets organizations create and issue verifiable credentials to validate claims, such as employment, education, certifications, and residence. The new Face Check feature is available as a free public preview release, with a yet-unpriced commercial release slated for later this year.Face Check uses Microsoft's Azure AI Face API to match a person's real-time selfie — confirmed to be authentic via ""liveness detection"" — captured by the Microsoft Authenticator app with an existing trusted identity document, such as an employment ID, driver's license, or passport. Microsoft Authenticator's Verified ID feature generates a confidence score and sends it to the party who requested a Face Check.Early preview customers are using Face Check with Verified ID to reduce the risks of account takeover and impersonation for employees, vendors, and business guests. Help-desk and cybersecurity operations provider BEMO, an early Face Check tester, used the feature to verify the identity of an employee issuing a request, according to Microsoft.""Face Check using Entra Verified ID is a new verification capability that can be used to verify the person authenticating is indeed the rightful owner of authentication credentials, such as passkeys, or FIDO2, MFA, or even username and password,"" says Ankur Patel, Microsoft's head of product for Entra Verified ID. The company says Face Check is more reliable than self-attestation for accessing sensitive data or authentication to create new accounts.Extending Microsoft Entra ID with Verified IDVerified ID was built with a standards-based interop profile in partnership with IBM, Workday, Ping, and Mattr ""so anyone can build compatible digital wallets,"" Patel notes. Originally described by Patel as a standards-based decentralized identity (DID) system, Verified ID is intended to address the limitations of Microsoft Entra ID services (formerly Azure AD) by enabling the use of credentials beyond the organization.Gartner forecasts that integration with identity verification (IDV) and access management platforms will become standard by 2027 for onboarding, credentialing, and recovery. Further, IDV could reduce account takeover attacks by 75%, according to Gartner.""All access management [AM] vendors, including Microsoft and its direct competitors, offer the support to integrate with third-party IDV tools,"" says Gartner senior research director Henrique Teixeira. ""However, only a minority offer their own IDV solution and even fewer are combining it with a biometric authentication solution out of the box.""Facial Recognition Raises Privacy ConcernsWhile Microsoft promises a more user-friendly and secure approach to digital IDV with Face Check and Verified ID, critics of facial recognition have long decried the potential for misusing the technology. Microsoft's Patel describes Face Check as ""a privacy-respecting facial-matching feature for high-assurance verifications,"" noting that privacy concerns were taken into account.For one, the company emphasized that neither Microsoft Authenticator, Verified ID, nor the Azure AI services store or retain any of the data or images.""[When using Face Check], there's a 91% chance that it's me and not somebody else. So even if you got ahold of my phone, you couldn't use it,"" Patel says. Statistically, he adds, there is a one in a billion chance that a match could be an impersonation attack within a five-minute time window.Will 91% be reliable enough to satisfy concerns by enterprises providing access to sensitive data? Organizations can decide whether the risk is appropriate for specific types of business decisions and configure the acceptance score accordingly, according to Patel.Gartner's Teixeira predicts that preventing risks of attacks overshadows privacy issues.""I believe that the additional benefits of such solutions in reducing the probability of a breach will outweigh the privacy concerns associated with the technology,"" he says.The addition of Face Check to Verified ID aims to boost confidence in the credentials that users present. Patel says that Microsoft will soon reveal plans to extend its Face API pattern to verify a broader array of identity attributes, such as verified work history and legal entity verification, through partnerships with Dun & Bradstreet (DNB) and LexisNexis.Lots of Interest in Facial RecognitionDespite calls for regulation, facial recognition is one of the more popular forms of authentication. When the Biometrics Institute asked which form of biometrics organizations are likely to implement for its 2023 Industry Survey, 45% of respondents said they planned to increase their use of facial recognition. Coming in second was multimodal biometrics at 16%, followed by voice at 9%, iris at 7%, and behavioral at 6%.""The Microsoft approach is highly valuable for a broader scale of adoption of verified identities and is expected to benefit the entire industry,"" says KuppingerCole Analysts founder and principal analyst Martin Kuppinger. ""This will help in achieving critical mass.""Nevertheless, mass adoption won't happen in the short term, Kuppinger adds.""Challenges may arise regarding regulatory requirements for certain scenarios, but, basically, the approach helps in strengthening the cybersecurity posture and [ensures] privacy issues are addressed in a well-thought-out manner, avoiding sharing or centrally storing biometric information,"" he says.Cost will also be a factor.""Organizations surely will be keen to understanding the yet-to-be-announced licensing model before making strategic decisions,"" Kuppinger says.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Managed Everything?

PRC State-Sponsored Actors Compromise and Maintain Persistent Access to U.S. Critical Infrastructure | CISA,"Actions to take today to mitigate Volt Typhoon activity:- Apply patches for internet-facing systems. Prioritize patching critical vulnerabilities in appliances known to be frequently exploited by Volt Typhoon.- Implement phishing-resistant MFA.- Ensure logging is turned on for application, access, and security logs and store logs in a central system.SUMMARYThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assess that People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actors are seeking to pre-position themselves on IT networks for disruptive or destructive cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States.CISA, NSA, FBI and the following partners are releasing this advisory to warn critical infrastructure organizations about this assessment, which is based on observations from the U.S. authoring agencies’ incident response activities at critical infrastructure organizations compromised by the PRC state-sponsored cyber group known as Volt Typhoon (also known as Vanguard Panda, BRONZE SILHOUETTE, Dev-0391, UNC3236, Voltzite, and Insidious Taurus):- U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)- U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA)- Australian Signals Directorate’s (ASD’s) Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)- Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), a part of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE)- United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)- New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ)The U.S. authoring agencies have confirmed that Volt Typhoon has compromised the IT environments of multiple critical infrastructure organizations—primarily in Communications, Energy, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems Sectors—in the continental and non-continental United States and its territories, including Guam. Volt Typhoon’s choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions. The U.S. authoring agencies are concerned about the potential for these actors to use their network access for disruptive effects in the event of potential geopolitical tensions and/or military conflicts. CCCS assesses that the direct threat to Canada’s critical infrastructure from PRC state-sponsored actors is likely lower than that to U.S. infrastructure, but should U.S. infrastructure be disrupted, Canada would likely be affected as well, due to cross-border integration. ASD’s ACSC and NCSC-NZ assess Australian and New Zealand critical infrastructure, respectively, could be vulnerable to similar activity from PRC state-sponsored actors.As the authoring agencies have previously highlighted, the use of living off the land (LOTL) techniques is a hallmark of Volt Typhoon actors’ malicious cyber activity when targeting critical infrastructure. The group also relies on valid accounts and leverage strong operational security, which combined, allows for long-term undiscovered persistence. In fact, the U.S. authoring agencies have recently observed indications of Volt Typhoon actors maintaining access and footholds within some victim IT environments for at least five years. Volt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre-exploitation reconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment; tailor their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the victim’s environment; and dedicate ongoing resources to maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time, even after initial compromise.The authoring agencies urge critical infrastructure organizations to apply the mitigations in this advisory and to hunt for similar malicious activity using the guidance herein provided, along with the recommendations found in joint guide Identifying and Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques. These mitigations are primarily intended for IT and OT administrators in critical infrastructure organizations. Following the mitigations for prevention of or in response to an incident will help disrupt Volt Typhoon’s accesses and reduce the threat to critical infrastructure entities.If activity is identified, the authoring agencies strongly recommend that critical infrastructure organizations apply the incident response recommendations in this advisory and report the incident to the relevant agency (see Contact Information section).For additional information, see joint advisory People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actor Living off the Land to Evade Detection and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) press release U.S. Government Disrupts Botnet People’s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical Infrastructure.

See Appendix C: MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for tables of the Volt Typhoon cyber threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK’s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping and CISA’s Decider Tool.Overview of ActivityIn May 2023, the authoring agencies—working with industry partners—disclosed information about activity attributed to Volt Typhoon (see joint advisory People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actor Living off the Land to Evade Detection). Since then, CISA, NSA, and FBI have determined that this activity is part of a broader campaign in which Volt Typhoon actors have successfully infiltrated the networks of critical infrastructure organizations in the continental and non-continental United States and its territories, including Guam.The U.S. authoring agencies have primarily observed compromises linked to Volt Typhoon in Communications, Energy, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems sector organizations’ IT networks. Some victims are smaller organizations with limited cybersecurity capabilities that provide critical services to larger organizations or key geographic locations.Volt Typhoon actors tailor their TTPs to the victim environment; however, the U.S. authoring agencies have observed the actors typically following the same pattern of behavior across identified intrusions. Their choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable the disruption of OT functions across multiple critical infrastructure sectors (see Figure 1).- Volt Typhoon conducts extensive pre-compromise reconnaissance to learn about the target organization’s network architecture and operational protocols. This reconnaissance includes identifying network topologies, security measures, typical user behaviors, and key network and IT staff. The intelligence gathered by Volt Typhoon actors is likely leveraged to enhance their operational security. For example, in some instances, Volt Typhoon actors may have abstained from using compromised credentials outside of normal working hours to avoid triggering security alerts on abnormal account activities.- Volt Typhoon typically gains initial access to the IT network by exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in public-facing network appliances (e.g., routers, virtual private networks [VPNs], and firewalls) and then connects to the victim’s network via VPN for follow-on activities.- Volt Typhoon aims to obtain administrator credentials within the network, often by exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the operating system or network services. In some cases, Volt Typhoon has obtained credentials insecurely stored on a public-facing network appliance.- Volt Typhoon uses valid administrator credentials to move laterally to the domain controller (DC) and other devices via remote access services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).- Volt Typhoon conducts discovery in the victim’s network, leveraging LOTL binaries for stealth. A key tactic includes using PowerShell to perform targeted queries on Windows event logs, focusing on specific users and periods. These queries facilitate the discreet extraction of security event logs into.datfiles, allowing Volt Typhoon actors to gather critical information while minimizing detection. This strategy, blending in-depth pre-compromise reconnaissance with meticulous post-exploitation intelligence collection, underscores their sophisticated and strategic approach to cyber operations.- Volt Typhoon achieves full domain compromise by extracting the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) from the DC. Volt Typhoon frequently employs the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) using command-line utilities such asvssadminto accessNTDS.dit. TheNTDS.ditfile is a centralized repository that contains critical Active Directory data, including user accounts, passwords (in hashed form), and other sensitive data, which can be leveraged for further exploitation. This method entails the creation of a shadow copy—a point-in-time snapshot—of the volume hosting theNTDS.ditfile. By leveraging this snapshot, Volt Typhoon actors effectively bypass the file locking mechanisms inherent in a live Windows environment, which typically prevent direct access to theNTDS.ditfile while the domain controller is operational.- Volt Typhoon likely uses offline password cracking techniques to decipher these hashes. This process involves extracting the hashes from theNTDS.ditfile and then applying various password cracking methods, such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, or more sophisticated techniques like rainbow tables to uncover the plaintext passwords. The successful decryption of these passwords allows Volt Typhoon actors to obtain elevated access and further infiltrate and manipulate the network.- Volt Typhoon uses elevated credentials for strategic network infiltration and additional discovery, often focusing on gaining capabilities to access OT assets. Volt Typhoon actors have been observed testing access to domain-joint OT assets using default OT vendor credentials, and in certain instances, they have possessed the capability to access OT systems whose credentials were compromised viaNTDS.dittheft. This access enables potential disruptions, such as manipulating heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in server rooms or disrupting critical energy and water controls, leading to significant infrastructure failures (in some cases, Volt Typhoon actors had the capability to access camera surveillance systems at critical infrastructure facilities). In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon actors moved laterally to a control system and were positioned to move to a second control system.After successfully gaining access to legitimate accounts, Volt Typhoon actors exhibit minimal activity within the compromised environment (except discovery as noted above), suggesting their objective is to maintain persistence rather than immediate exploitation. This assessment is supported by observed patterns where Volt Typhoon methodically re-targets the same organizations over extended periods, often spanning several years, to continuously validate and potentially enhance their unauthorized accesses. Evidence of their meticulous approach is seen in instances where they repeatedly exfiltrate domain credentials, ensuring access to current and valid accounts. For example, in one compromise, Volt Typhoon likely extractedNTDS.dit from three domain controllers in a four-year period. In another compromise, Volt Typhoon actors extractedNTDS.dit two times from a victim in a nine-month period.Industry reporting—identifying that Volt Typhoon actors are silent on the network following credential dumping and perform discovery to learn about the environment, but do not exfiltrate data—is consistent with the U.S. authoring agencies’ observations. This indicates their aim is to achieve and maintain persistence on the network. In one confirmed compromise, an industry partner observed Volt Typhoon actors dumping credentials at regular intervals.In addition to leveraging stolen account credentials, the actors use LOTL techniques and avoid leaving malware artifacts on systems that would cause alerts. Their strong focus on stealth and operational security allows them to maintain long-term, undiscovered persistence. Further, Volt Typhoon’s operational security is enhanced by targeted log deletion to conceal their actions within the compromised environment.See the below sections for Volt Typhoon TTPs observed by the U.S. authoring agencies from multiple confirmed Volt Typhoon compromises.Observed TTPsReconnaissanceVolt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre-compromise reconnaissance [TA0043] to learn about the target organization [T1591], its network [T1590], and its staff [T1589]. This includes web searches [T1593]—including victim-owned sites [T1594]—for victim host [T1592], identity, and network information, especially for information on key network and IT administrators. According to industry reporting, Volt Typhoon actors use FOFA[1], Shodan, and Censys for querying or searching for exposed infrastructure. In some instances, the U.S. authoring agencies have observed Volt Typhoon actors targeting the personal emails of key network and IT staff [T1589.002] post compromise.Resource DevelopmentHistorically, Volt Typhoon actors use multi-hop proxies for command and control (C2) infrastructure [T1090.003]. The proxy is typically composed of virtual private servers (VPSs) [T1583.003] or small office/home office (SOHO) routers. Recently, Volt Typhoon actors used Cisco and NETGEAR end-of-life SOHO routers implanted with KV Botnet malware to support their operations [T1584.005]. (See DOJ press release U.S. Government Disrupts Botnet People’s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical Infrastructure for more information).Initial AccessTo obtain initial access [TA0001], Volt Typhoon actors commonly exploit vulnerabilities in networking appliances such as those from Fortinet, Ivanti Connect Secure (formerly Pulse Secure), NETGEAR, Citrix, and Cisco [T1190]. They often use publicly available exploit code for known vulnerabilities [T1588.005] but are also adept at discovering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities [T1587.004].- In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon actors likely obtained initial access by exploiting CVE-2022-42475 in a network perimeter FortiGate 300D firewall that was not patched. There is evidence of a buffer overflow attack identified within the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)-VPN crash logs.Once initial access is achieved, Volt Typhoon actors typically shift to establishing persistent access [TA0003]. They often use VPN sessions to securely connect to victim environments [T1133], enabling discreet follow-on intrusion activities. This tactic not only provides a stable foothold in the network but also allows them to blend in with regular traffic, significantly reducing their chances of detection.ExecutionVolt Typhoon actors rarely use malware for post-compromise execution. Instead, once Volt Typhoon actors gain access to target environments, they use hands-on-keyboard activity via the command-line [T1059] and other native tools and processes on systems [T1218] (often referred to as “LOLBins”), known as LOTL, to maintain and expand access to the victim networks. According to industry reporting, some “commands appear to be exploratory or experimental, as the operators [i.e., malicious actors] adjust and repeat them multiple times.”[2]For more details on LOTL activity, see the Credential Access and Discovery sections and Appendix A: Volt Typhoon LOTL Activity.Similar to LOTL, Volt Typhoon actors also use legitimate but outdated versions of network admin tools. For example, in one confirmed compromise, actors downloaded [T1105] an outdated version ofcomsvcs.dll on the DC in a non-standard folder.comsvcs.dll is a legitimate Microsoft Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file normally found in theSystem32 folder. The actors used this DLL withMiniDump and the process ID of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to dump the LSASS process memory [T1003.001] and obtain credentials (LSASS process memory space contains hashes for the current user’s operating system (OS) credentials).The actors also use legitimate non-native network admin and forensic tools. For example, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed using Magnet RAM Capture (MRC) version 1.20 on domain controllers. MRC is a free imaging tool that captures the physical memory of a computer, and Volt Typhoon actors likely used it to analyze in-memory data for sensitive information (such as credentials) and in-transit data not typically accessible on disk. Volt Typhoon actors have also been observed implanting Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) for command and control.[3] (See the Command and Control section).PersistenceVolt Typhoon primarily relies on valid credentials for persistence [T1078].Defense EvasionVolt Typhoon has strong operational security. Their actors primarily use LOTL for defense evasion [TA0005], which allows them to camouflage their malicious activity with typical system and network behavior, potentially circumventing simplistic endpoint security capabilities. For more information, see joint guide Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques.Volt Typhoon actors also obfuscate their malware. In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon obfuscated FRP client files (BrightmetricAgent.exe andSMSvcService.exe) and the command-line port scanning utility ScanLine by packing the files with Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX) [T1027.002]. FRP client applications support encryption, compression, and easy token authentication and work across multiple protocols—including transmission control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), and hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). The FRP client applications use the Kuai connection protocol (KCP) for error-checked and anonymous data stream delivery over UDP, with packet-level encryption support. See Appendix C and CISA Malware Analysis Report (MAR)-10448362-1.v1 for more information.In addition to LOTL and obfuscation techniques, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed selectively clearing Windows Event Logs [T1070.001], system logs, and other technical artifacts to remove evidence [T1070.009] of their intrusion activity and masquerading file names [T1036.005].Credential AccessVolt Typhoon actors first obtain credentials from public-facing appliances after gaining initial access by exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities [T1068] in the operating system or network services. In some cases, they have obtained credentials insecurely stored on the appliance [T1552]. In one instance, where Volt Typhoon likely exploited CVE-2022-42475 in an unpatched Fortinet device, Volt Typhoon actors compromised a domain admin account stored inappropriately on the device.Volt Typhoon also consistently obtains valid credentials by extracting the Active Directory database file (NTDS.dit)—in some cases multiple times from the same victim over long periods [T1003.003].NTDS.dit contains usernames, hashed passwords, and group memberships for all domain accounts, essentially allowing for full domain compromise if the hashes can be cracked offline.To obtainNTDS.dit, the U.S. authoring agencies have observed Volt Typhoon:- Move laterally [TA0008] to the domain controller via an interactive RDP session using a compromised account with domain administrator privileges [T1021.001];- Execute the Windows-nativevssadmin[T1006] command to create a volume shadow copy;- Use Windows Management Instrumentation Console (WMIC) commands [T1047] to executentdsutil(a LOTL utility) to copyNTDS.ditandSYSTEMregistry hive from the volume shadow copy; and- Exfiltrate [TA0010]NTDS.ditandSYSTEMregistry hive to crack passwords offline) [T1110.002]. (For more details, including specific commands used, see Appendix A: Volt Typhoon LOTL Activity.)Note: A volume shadow copy contains a copy of all the files and folders that exist on the specified volume. Each volume shadow copy created on a DC includes itsNTDS.ditand theSYSTEMregistry hive, which provides keys to decrypt theNTDS.ditfile.Volt Typhoon actors have also been observed interacting with a PuTTY application by enumerating existing stored sessions [T1012]. Given this interaction and the exposure of cleartext-stored proxy passwords used in remote administration, Volt Typhoon actors potentially had access to PuTTY profiles that allow access to critical systems (see the Lateral Movement section).According to industry reporting, Volt Typhoon actors attempted to dump credentials through LSASS (see Appendix B for commands used).[2]- Mimikatz is a credential dumping tool and Volt Typhoon actors use it to obtain credentials. In one confirmed compromise, the Volt Typhoon used RDP to connect to a server and run Mimikatz after leveraging a compromised administrator account to deploy it.- Impacket is an open source Python toolkit for programmatically constructing and manipulating network protocols. It contains tools for Kerberos manipulation, Windows credential dumping, packet sniffing, and relay attacks—as well as remote service execution.DiscoveryVolt Typhoon actors have been observed using commercial tools, LOTL utilities, and appliances already present on the system for system information [T1082], network service [T1046], group [T1069] and user [T1033] discovery.Volt Typhoon uses at least the following LOTL tools and commands for system information, network service, group, and user discovery techniques:|||Some observed specific examples of discovery include:- Capturing successful logon events [T1654].- Specifically, in one incident, analysis of the PowerShell console history of a domain controller indicated that security event logs were directed to a file nameduser.dat, as evidenced by the executed commandGet-EventLog security -instanceid 4624 -after [year-month-date] | fl * | Out-File 'C:\users\public\documents\user.dat'. This indicates the group's specific interest in capturing successful logon events (event ID4624) to analyze user authentication patterns within the network. Additionally, file system analysis, specifically of the Master File Table (MFT), uncovered evidence of a separate file,systeminfo.dat, which was created inC:\Users\Public\Documentsbut subsequently deleted [T1070.004]. The presence of these activities suggests a methodical approach by Volt Typhoon actors in collecting and then possibly removing traces of sensitive log information from the compromised system.- Specifically, in one incident, analysis of the PowerShell console history of a domain controller indicated that security event logs were directed to a file named- Executingtasklist /vto gather a detailed process listing [T1057], followed by executingtaskkill /f /im rdpservice.exe(the function of this executable is not known).- Executingnet userandquserfor user account information [T1087.001].- Creating and accessing a file namedrult3uil.logon a domain controller inC:\Windows\System32\. Therult3uil.logfile contained user activities on a compromised system, showcasing a combination of window title information [T1010] and focus shifts, keypresses, and command executions across Google Chrome and Windows PowerShell, with corresponding timestamps.- Employingpingwith various IP addresses to check network connectivity [T1016.001] andnet startto list running services [T1007].See Appendix A for additional LOTL examples.In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon actors attempted to use Advanced IP Scanner, which was on the network for admin use, to scan the network.Volt Typhoon actors have been observed strategically targeting network administrator web browser data—focusing on both browsing history and stored credentials [T1555.003]—to facilitate targeting of personal email addresses (see the Reconnaissance section) for further discovery and possible network modifications that may impact the threat actor’s persistence within victim networks.In one confirmed compromise:- Volt Typhoon actors obtained the history file from theUser Datadirectory of a network administrator user’s Chrome browser. To obtain the history file, Volt Typhoon actors first executed an RDP session to the user’s workstation where they initially attempted, and failed, to obtain theC$ File Name: users\{redacted}\appdata\local\Google\Chrome\UserData\default\Historyfile, as evidenced by the accompanying1016(reopen failed) SMB error listed in the application event log. The threat actors then disconnected the RDP session to the workstation and accessed the fileC:\Users\{redacted}\Downloads\History.zip. This file presumably contained data from the User Data directory of the user’s Chrome browser, which the actors likely saved in the Downloads directory for exfiltration [T1074]. Shortly after accessing thehistory.zipfile, the actors terminated RDP sessions.- About four months later, Volt Typhoon actors accessed the same user’s Chrome dataC$ File Name: Users\{redacted}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Local Stateand$ File Name: Users\{redacted}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Datavia SMB. The Local State file contains the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption key [T1552.004] used to encrypt the passwords stored in the Chrome browser, which would enable the actors to obtain plaintext passwords stored in the Login Data file in the Chrome browser.In another confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon actors accessed directories containing Chrome and Edge user data on multiple systems. Directory interaction was observed over the network to paths such asC:\Users\{redacted}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\ andC:\Users\{redacted}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\. They also enumerated several directories, including directories containing vulnerability testing and cyber related content and facilities data, such as construction drawings [T1083].Lateral MovementFor lateral movement, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed predominantly employing RDP with compromised valid administrator credentials. Note: With a full on-premises Microsoft Active Directory identity compromise (see the Credential Access section), the group may be capable of using other methods such as Pass the Hash or Pass the Ticket for lateral movement [T1550].In one confirmed compromise of a Water and Wastewater Systems Sector entity, after obtaining initial access, Volt Typhoon actors connected to the network via a VPN with administrator credentials they obtained and opened an RDP session with the same credentials to move laterally. Over a nine-month period, they moved laterally to a file server, a domain controller, an Oracle Management Server (OMS), and a VMware vCenter server. The actors obtained domain credentials from the domain controller and performed discovery, collection, and exfiltration on the file server (see the Discovery and Collection and Exfiltration sections).Volt Typhoon’s movement to the vCenter server was likely strategic for pre-positioning to OT assets. The vCenter server was adjacent to OT assets, and Volt Typhoon actors were observed interacting with the PuTTY application on the server by enumerating existing stored sessions. With this information, Volt Typhoon potentially had access to a range of critical PuTTY profiles, including those for water treatment plants, water wells, an electrical substation, OT systems, and network security devices. This would enable them to access these critical systems [T1563]. See Figure 2.Additionally, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed using PSExec to execute remote processes, including the automated acceptance of the end-user license agreement (EULA) through an administrative account, signified by theaccepteula command flag.Volt Typhoon actors may have attempted to move laterally to a cloud environment in one victim’s network but direct attribution to the Volt Typhoon group was inconclusive. During the period of the their known network presence, there were anomalous login attempts to an Azure tenant [T1021.007] potentially using credentials [T1078.004] previously compromised from theft ofNTDS.dit. These attempts, coupled with misconfigured virtual machines with open RDP ports, suggested a potential for cloud-based lateral movement. However, subsequent investigations, including password changes and multifactor authentication (MFA) implementations, revealed authentication failures from non-associated IP addresses, with no definitive link to Volt Typhoon.Collection and ExfiltrationThe U.S. authoring agencies assess Volt Typhoon primarily collects information that would facilitate follow-on actions with physical impacts. For example, in one confirmed compromise, they collected [TA0009] sensitive information obtained from a file server in multiple zipped files [T1560] and likely exfiltrated [TA0010] the files via Server Message Block (SMB) [T1048] (see Figure 3). Collected information included diagrams and documentation related to OT equipment, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, relays, and switchgear. This data is crucial for understanding and potentially impacting critical infrastructure systems, indicating a focus on gathering intelligence that could be leveraged in actions targeting physical assets and systems.In another compromise, Volt Typhoon actors leveraged WMIC to create and use temporary directories (C:\Users\Public\pro,C:\Windows\Temp\tmp,C:\Windows\Temp\tmp\Active Directory andC:\Windows\Temp\tmp\registry) to stage the extractedntds.dit andSYSTEM registry hives fromntdsutil execution volume shadow copies (see the Credential Access section) obtained from two DCs. They then compressed and archived the extractedntds.dit and accompanying registry files by executingronf.exe, which was likely a renamed version of the archive utilityrar.exe) [T1560.001].Command and ControlVolt Typhoon actors have been observed leveraging compromised SOHO routers and virtual private servers (VPS) to proxy C2 traffic. For more information, see DOJ press release U.S. Government Disrupts Botnet People’s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical Infrastructure).They have also been observed setting up FRP clients [T1090] on a victim’s corporate infrastructure to establish covert communications channels [T1573] for command and control. In one instance, Volt Typhoon actors implanted the FRP client with filenameSMSvcService.exe on a Shortel Enterprise Contact Center (ECC) server and a second FRP client with filenameBrightmetricagent.exe on another server. These clients, when executed via PowerShell [T1059.001], open reverse proxies between the compromised system and Volt Typhoon C2 servers.Brightmetricagent.exe has additional capabilities. The FRP client can locate servers behind a network firewall or obscured through Network Address Translation (NAT) [T1016]. It also contains multiplexer libraries that can bi-directionally stream data over NAT networks and contains a command-line interface (CLI) library that can leverage command shells such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Z Shell (zsh) [T1059.004]. See Appendix C and MAR-10448362-1.v1 for more information.In the same compromise, Volt Typhoon actors exploited a Paessler Router Traffic Grapher (PRTG) server as an intermediary for their FRP operations. To facilitate this, they used the netsh command, a legitimate Windows command, to create a PortProxy registry modification [T1112] on the PRTG server [T1090.001]. This key alteration redirected specific port traffic to Volt Typhoon’s proxy infrastructure, effectively converting the PRTG’s server into a proxy for their C2 traffic [T1584.004] (see Appendix B for details).DETECTION/HUNT RECOMMENDATIONSApply Living off th",,,

Q&A: Tel Aviv Railway Project Bakes In Cyber Defenses,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Q&A: Tel Aviv Railway Project Bakes In Cyber DefensesHow a light railway in Israel is fortifying its cybersecurity architecture amid an increase in OT network threats.February 7, 2024Railway networks are suffering an increase in cyberattacks, most notably the August 2023 incident in which hackers infiltrated the radio frequency communications of Poland's railway network and temporarily disrupted train traffic.This has led to nations and rail operators scrambling to protect their networks, such as Saudi Arabia recently announcing a partnership to improve the security of its service.Another operator enhancing the protection of its networks is Tel Aviv's Purple Line light rail transport (LRT), a line currently under construction and due to be open and running by the end of this decade.Dark Reading spoke with Eran Ner Gaon, CISO of Tel Aviv Purple Line LRT, and Shaked Kafzan, co-founder and CTO of rail cybersecurity provider Cervello, about dealing with increased attacks on OT networks.Eran Ner Gaon, CISO of the Tel Aviv Purple LineShaked Kafzan, Co-Founder and CTO of CervelloDark Reading: What steps have you taken to protect your networks from cyberattacks?Eran Ner Gaon: In order to identify OT threats, we developed a comprehensive OT security strategy that includes measures such as threat intelligence, technological measures, incident response plans, and training of employees related to the regulation of the INCD [Israel National Cyber Directorate].From a human point of view, the treatment of OT threats requires extended specialization not only from cybersecurity but a deep familiarity with the worlds of OT and their communication protocols. For this purpose, we require skilled manpower who sits in the control centers with eyes and hands right on the keyboard upon receiving a suspicion of an incident. From a technological point of view, we provide protection at all network layers: physical separation between networks, work environments and microsegmentation; identity management with advanced tools using PAM; [and] establishing a laboratory that simulates the operational activity and adjusting the changes on the system before downloading for execution.DR: Can cyberattacks against OT be thoroughly defended against?Shaked Kafzan: From the perspective of a cybersecurity company, the surge in attacks against OT systems is worrying but expected. What's more worrying is how poorly prepared the critical infrastructure sector is against attacks with potentially fatal or incredibly costly consequences. When the stakes are so high, when the costs are so severe, there is no room for risk. Cybersecurity must be implemented as a means to prevent, not to ""fix.""DR: What is different about rail security from a protection perspective?Kafzan: Cybersecurity for rail and OT must be proactive and continuous. To do this, organizations must implement network segmentation on real network traffic, have strict authentication and access controls, ensure continuous monitoring and detection of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, and stay updated on what is going on in the space, including keeping up with cybersecurity compliance standards.DR: Of course, a reliable patching process and vulnerability management best practices are key to a security strategy. But for an OT organization, what are the issues with patching while keeping systems online?Kafzan: Patching a cybersecurity vulnerability within a rail network is like changing the wheels of a car while it's moving: It's not simple, and, many times, it's not doable. Though we are a cybersecurity provider, our security strategy has to bear in mind the interests of our rail customers, which are high availability and physical safety.This means we must rely on passive yet deeply informative and rail operational contextual solutions that will mitigate a cybersecurity incident and fortify the organization's cybersecurity posture without any interference in its existing infrastructure and systems.DR: Each system comes with its own challenges, so what steps do you take when patching?Goan: Since business continuity is must, we examine any implementation or change in general — meaning that first we consider whether the systems support live or hot patching, then we will verify if downtime is required, and what is it [the downtime]? And finally ... we will consider the risk of the repair versus leaving the weak point.In the background of these things, we strengthen our operating concept through a strong and updated laboratory environment for the operational environment that supports many tests of the changes that we want to implement alongside a robust system of backups and procedures that allow us to go back to any point in time before the change was made.DR: As a possible protection option, we've seen AI cited as a key trend for cybersecurity in 2024, in particular in the field of industrial automation. Does this change the way you work, and OT can be better secured?Goan: Along with the many threats that AI poses to us, we receive inherent advantages in the technological tools we have chosen that combine AI capabilities in a fast, efficient, and automatic manner.As we move forward, I predict that the AI capabilities will be able to perform a large number of high-quality and good actions for our systems, but we must remember that in the end there will be hands on the keyboard and a high-quality human response that will be able to prioritize the events.DR: From your position providing security for rail operators, how does AI fit into what you provide?Kafzan: Behind the scenes, AI is more than just a trend, it is an exciting opportunity to more effectively enhance the security of rail systems. It allows us to analyze vast amounts of data while staying continuously updated with the global cybersecurity community's knowledge, in order to quickly identify, respond, and remediate threats in real-time.AI will allow us to predict potential security breaches before they happen, based on patterns it has learned. An immediate benefit of the technologies is its ability to improve operational efficiency, optimize schedules and routes, and enhance passenger experience by providing real-time insights. It can help minimize downtime and extend the lifespan of the existing infrastructure by offering predictions of when parts of the train systems or track are likely to fail or need servicing.Read more about:DR Global Middle East & AfricaAbout the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024",security updates and patches,news and industry updates,FALSE

Iran's srael cyber ops tease US election meddling tactics,"Iran's cyber operations in Israel a potential prelude to US election interferenceTactics are more sophisticated and supported in greater numbersIran's anti-Israel cyber operations are providing a window into the techniques the country may deploy in the run-up to the 2024 US Presidential elections, Microsoft says.An analysis of Iran's activity, published by Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) today, concluded that Iran may again target US elections as it did in 2020, using more sophisticated techniques from a wealth of different groups.The main fear for US elections comes from the growing number of pro-Iran and Iran-linked groups carrying out cyberattacks and influence operations since the conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out in October 2023.""Defenders can no longer take solace in tracking a few groups,"" MTAC's report reads. ""Rather, a growing number of access agents, influence groups, and cyber actors makes for a more complex and intertwined threat environment.""Based on Microsoft's threat intelligence data, the US and Israel have consistently been the prime targets for Iran-linked cyberattacks, and the increasing effectiveness and brazenness of those efforts may be a cause for concern as November's election edges closer.Iran's influence operations, for example, pushing anti-Israel propaganda, were shown to be highly effective at reaching Western audiences – a tactic that could feasibly be transposed to the US election too.In the first week of the war between Israel and Hamas, Microsoft spotted a 42 percent spike in traffic to news sites run by or affiliated with the Iranian state.That surge was especially apparent in English-speaking countries such as the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and even though this traffic trailed off after the first week of the war, for three weeks after it remained 28 percent above pre-war levels.These influence operations are well documented already and were spotted early in the conflict, but the effectiveness of the campaigns to reach Western audiences, combined with the increasing number of groups willing to engage in these missions, is a concern.Iran is known for historically taking advantage of channels such as social media for these operations, but for the first time AI played a role, Microsoft said. It pointed to a December hijacking of a streaming TV channel to broadcast fake news reports, presented by an AI-generated human newsreader that reached audiences in the UK, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates.""This marked the first Iranian influence operation Microsoft has detected where AI played a key component in its messaging and is one example of the fast and significant expansion in the scope of Iranian operations since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict.""As for how Iran might wish to act in the months leading up to November's presidential election, we can look back to 2020 for clues.According to a report [PDF] from the US Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the country's main aim was to undermine the reelection prospects of President Trump.The pro-Iran players at work here didn't attempt to jeopardize Trump's campaign through the promotion of his rivals, but instead by sowing division and exacerbating social tensions among US citizens. There was no evidence to suggest that the election itself or its voting systems were tampered with by Iran's campaign.""We have high confidence in this assessment,"" the report reads. ""We assess that Supreme Leader Khamenei authorized the campaign and Iran's military and intelligence services implemented it using overt and covert messaging and cyber operations.""In response, the US indicted two Iranians who both have $10 million bounties on their heads, per the Rewards for Justice program, available to anyone with information leading to their location.Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi and Sajjad Kashian, aged 24 and 27 respectively, are alleged to have stolen US voter data and used it to send threatening emails in a bid to intimidate voters. Among a sprawling list of allegations, they also are said to have breached a US media company's network and would have succeeded in publishing false narratives if the FBI hadn't caught them and alerted the company beforehand.- Uncle Sam wants to make it clear that America's elections are very, very safe- Iranian cyberspies target US defense orgs with a brand new backdoor- Hacktivists boast: We shut down Iran's gas pumps today- US warns Iranian terrorist crew broke into 'multiple' US water facilitiesIran's influence efforts are essentially categorized by the US as those that seek to undermine the legitimacy of its elections and institutions more so than any single candidate. For example, the emails sent to US voters, like those by the two indicted individuals, were mainly designed to spread uncertainty around voter fraud.""We assess that Tehran's efforts to attempt to influence the outcome of the 2020 US election and Iranian officials' preference that former President Trump not be reelected were driven in part by a perception that the regime faced acute threats from the US,"" the DNI report reads.Microsoft believes that all three of the prime suspects for election interference – Iran, Russia, and China – will spin up their respective campaigns in the run-up to this year's election, despite taking a backseat during the 2022 midterms.It may be the first time a US election faces simultaneous interference attempts from multiple authoritarian states, it said.Iran's cyber capabilityIn addition to Iran's methods for conducting influence operations, including the abuse of social media platforms and pushing news content that's seemingly legitimate, Iran has also demonstrated its significant cyber capability in recent attacks in Israel to support its campaign.In addition to pushing the boundaries, poking the US to see what it can get away with, as it has done recently with the attack on its water systems late last year, Iran has engaged in destructive cyber operations akin to those used in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.For example, in addition to taking an Israel-made programmable logic controller offline at a Pennsylvania water authority in November, displaying an anti-Israel message on the screen, Tehran-linked groups such as Shahid Kaveh used ransomware against Israeli CCTV cameras.This took place in October, roughly two weeks into the war, and Shahid Kaveh used one of its personas to claim it breached the CCTV of the Nevatim Air Force base, when in fact it only popped the cameras on a civilian street in Nevatim, not the military base in the same area.As the conflict raged on, Iran's destructive cyber attacks began to grow in scope, including targets such as Bahrain and Albania – both of which have relatively friendly relations with Israel.Albania was the target of attacks from the Homeland Justice group, part of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Homeland Justice warned of impending attacks in November which eventually came on Christmas Day.Government systems were downed by the attacks, while a national airline and telco were also targeted at the same time.Bahrain, on the other hand, was targeted by al-Toufan. Government and financial organizations bore most of the brunt, which is thought to be in large part due to the 2020 signing of the Bahrain–Israel normalization agreement.From the early days of the conflict, the number of pro-Iran groups carrying out cyber operations grew quickly beyond the nine Microsoft initially tracked to 14 by the two-week mark. This then led to greater collaboration among these groups, including between MOIS group Pink Sandstorm and the Lebanon-based, pro-Iran Hezbollah group.""Collaboration lowers the barrier to entry, allowing each group to contribute existing capabilities and removes the need for a single group to develop a full spectrum of tooling or tradecraft,"" said Clint Watts, general manager at MTAC and author of its latest report.""Iranian focus on Israel has intensified. While Israel and the US have always been Tehran's main targets, the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war saw 43 percent of Iranian nation-state cyber activity focused on Israel, more than the next 14 targeted countries combined."" ®",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
"Critical Bugs in Canon Printers Allow Code Execution, DDoS","February 6, 2024Canon has patched seven critical buffer-overflow bugs affecting its small office multifunction printers and laser printers.Tracked as CVE-2023-6229 through CVE-2023-6234 (plus CVE-2024-0244), they affect different processes common across Canon's product lines – the username or password process involved with authenticating mobile devices, for example, the Service Location Protocol (SLP) attribute request process, and more.The company assigned them all ""critical"" 9.8 out of 10 ratings on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scale. As explained in a security advisory, they can allow unauthenticated attackers to remotely perform denial of service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution against any affected printers connected directly to the Internet. They also offer a handy pivot point to burrow deeper into victim networks.No exploitations have been observed in the wild as of yet, according to the company's European site, but owners should scan for indicators of compromise given that the bugs have been publicly known but unpatched for months.Hard to Handle: The Problem With Printer SecurityThe seven vulnerabilities patched on Feb. 5 were revealed alongside dozens of others at Pwn2Own Toronto's SOHO Smashup last summer, where contestants were invited to breach routers and then the small office/home office (SOHO) devices they connect to.Printers, so rarely recognized as fertile grounds for cyberattacks, were given their own category at the event.""It's a pretty large attack surface right now that's often overlooked, especially in small businesses, because it's hard to manage from an enterprise level,"" explains Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness for Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), which runs the Pwn2Own hacking contest. ""I mean, it's not like printers have automatic updates or other features that you can use to manage them cleanly and easily.""He adds, ""printers have always been kind of notorious for being finicky. You can go back to Office Space — one of the big scenes where they took a baseball bat to the printer. It's a joke, but it's a joke that's based in reality. These things are difficult to manage. The drivers are difficult to manage. And there's a lot of problematic software on them.""As a result, an old office printer — connected to other, more sensitive devices in a small or midsized business (SMB) network — tends to be rather trivial to crack.""I was a little shocked with how little they had to work on it to find really workable exploits,"" Childs recalls of Pwn2Own Toronto. As a case in point: ""Last year somebody played the Mario theme on a printer. And he said it took him longer to figure out how to play the Mario theme than to exploit the printer.""What SMBs Can Do About Printer Security ChaosBeyond the obvious step of updating to the latest firmware, Canon is advising its customers to ""set a private IP address for the products and create a network environment with a firewall or wired/Wi-Fi router that can restrict network access.""The advice speaks to a larger point: that even if printers are thick and unwieldy, what's manageable is their connectivity.""It used to be that there were, believe it or not, Internet-addressable printers. What businesses have done is they've gotten printers off the Internet, which is a change over the last decade. Now we've got them behind at least a firewall, or router, or something,"" Childs explains.However, he adds, ""as we've seen with PrintNightmare and other printer-based exploits, you can get past that firewall and then attack a printer, then pivot from that to other targets within an enterprise."" To prevent a printer compromise from reaching further into a network, SMBs need to focus on properly segmenting different areas of their networks.The best way to protect the printers themselves, meanwhile, is to patch. As Childs recalls, ""I can't tell you how many times I've heard of printers that were exploited that were three or four updates behind.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,security updates and patches,FALSE
"World Govs, Tech Giants Sign Spyware Responsibility Pledge","February 6, 2024A coalition of dozens of countries including France, the UK, and the US, along with tech giants such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft, have signed a joint agreement to combat the use of commercial spyware in ways that violate human rights.The news comes a day after the United States announced a visa restriction policy for those it deems to be abusing such tools.Commercial spyware, such as NSO Group's Pegasus, is usually installed on iPhones or Android devices and can eavesdrop on phone calls; intercept messaging; take pictures with the cameras; exfiltrate app data, photos, and files; and take voice and video recordings. The tools usually make use of zero-day exploits for initial access and sell for millions of dollars, meaning that their target market tends to consist of global government clients and large commercial interests.For their part, commercial spyware vendors (CSVs) usually position themselves as legitimate companies that aid law enforcement and other public-sector entities in apprehending criminals. Critics, on the other hand, argue that they simply sell cyber weapons to the highest bidders, including repressive regimes looking to surveil members of civil society — political opponents, dissidents, journalists, activists, and others. The victims are then targeted for further human-rights abuses, many have alleged, including Google, which today issued a detailed report on the rapidly proliferating CSV market.Pall Mall: Commercial Spyware Under ScrutinyAt a speech at the UK-France Cyber Proliferation conference at Lancaster House in London today, UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden announced the kickoff for the spyware initiative, dubbed the ""Pall Mall Process,"" which will be a ""multi-stakeholder initiative … to tackle the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercially available cyber-intrusion capabilities,"" he explained.More specifically, the coalition will establish guidelines for developing, selling, facilitating, purchasing, and using these types of tools and services, including defining irresponsible behavior and creating a framework for their transparent and accountable use.He also announced that the UK will invest £1 million into the nonprofit Shadowserver Foundation, to ""help them expand the access they provide to early warning systems, and to cyber resilience support for those impacted by cyberattacks.""Dowden noted, ""The scope [of our efforts] must be broad, not just looking at spyware, but also considering the 'hackers for hire' phenomenon, the exploit marketplace, alongside the broader range of 'off the shelf' intrusion capabilities, including tools for disruptive and destructive effect.""Ongoing Anti-Spyware Efforts by GovernmentAccording to Recorded Future, 24 of the 35 states and organizations attending the Lancaster House conference signed the pledge, agreeing to ""engage in an ongoing and globally inclusive dialogue, complementary to other multilateral initiatives,"" with a follow-up meeting set for next year in France.While the full accounting of attendees to the event has not been made public, Recorded Future reported that a range of countries — including Cyprus, Greece, Italy, and Singapore — all signed the pledge, while Hungary, Mexico, Spain, and Thailand, among others, did not.

Recent SSRF Flaw in Ivanti VPN Products Undergoes Mass Exploitation,"A recently disclosed server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability impacting Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure products has come under mass exploitation.The Shadowserver Foundation said it observed exploitation attempts originating from more than 170 unique IP addresses that aim to establish a reverse shell, among others.The attacks exploit CVE-2024-21893 (CVSS score: 8.2), an SSRF flaw in the SAML component of Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and Neurons for ZTA that allows an attacker to access otherwise restricted resources without authentication.Ivanti had previously divulged that the vulnerability had been exploited in targeted attacks aimed at a ""limited number of customers,"" but cautioned the status quo could change post public disclosure.That's exactly what appears to have happened, especially following the release of a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit by cybersecurity firm Rapid7 last week.The PoC involves fashioning an exploit chain that combines CVE-2024-21893 with CVE-2024-21887, a previously patched command injection flaw, to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution.It's worth noting here that CVE-2024-21893 is an alias for CVE-2023-36661 (CVSS score: 7.5), an SSRF vulnerability present in the open-source Shibboleth XMLTooling library. It was fixed by the maintainers in June 2023 with the release of version 3.2.4.Security researcher Will Dormann further pointed out other out-of-date open-source components used by Ivanti VPN appliances, such as curl 7.19.7, openssl 1.0.2n-fips, perl 5.6.1, psql 9.6.14, cabextract 0.5, ssh 5.3p1, and unzip 6.00, thus opening the door for more attacks.The development comes as threat actors have found a way to bypass Ivanti's initial mitigation, prompting the Utah-based company to release a second mitigation file. As of February 1, 2024, it has begun releasing official patches to address all the vulnerabilities.Last week, Google-owned Mandiant revealed that several threat actors are leveraging CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 to deploy an array of custom web shells tracked as BUSHWALK, CHAINLINE, FRAMESTING, and LIGHTWIRE.Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said it observed 28,474 exposed instances of Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure in 145 countries between January 26 and 30, 2024, with 610 compromised instances detected in 44 countries as of January 23, 2024.The ongoing exploitation of Ivanti flaws has also prompted the European Union, alongside CERT-EU, ENISA, and Europol, to issue a joint advisory urging organizations in the bloc to follow guidance provided by the vendor to mitigate potential risks.",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
How to Prepare for Elevated Cybersecurity Risk at the Super Bowl,"February 7, 2024COMMENTARYMajor sporting events such as the Super Bowl are fertile ground for threat actors: They attract huge audiences and offer a treasure trove of valuable data for hackers — from payment card data to user credentials that grant access to an organization's network. They also have a large concentration of high-profile targets, including celebrities, media personalities, political dignitaries, and famous athletes.It's not only the volume of targets and data that draw threat actors to these live events. They also create a sense of urgency, one of a hacker's greatest allies. If a threat actor can compromise critical systems, such as ticket entry or on-premises point-of-sale (PoS) payment systems, the venue, event organizers, and vendors may be highly motivated to pay a ransom to restore their systems quickly.Businesses must be extra vigilant in the lead-up to Super Bowl LVIII, as ""for ransom"" threats are increasingly significant. While ransomware is the best known, other ""for ransom"" threats include sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and exfiltration of sensitive or embarrassing data with the threat to disclose it unless the ransom is paid.The Offensive Line-up: Adversary PersonasAs in football, it's important to know your opponents. The adversary's offense can come at you from many angles.Cybercriminals are primarily driven by financial gain, look to monetize exploits quickly, and attack in large volumes. They are among the most prevalent of the threat actor lineup and often start attacking well before the event with social engineering and phishing campaigns to harvest credentials. Then they double down during the event with more destructive actions, including launching ""for ransom"" attacks and deploying information-stealing malware to siphon payment card data from PoS systems.Hacktivists are generally driven by ideology, with website defacement their weapon of choice. These hacktivists are trying to get their message out, and what better time than when the huge Super Bowl audience is watching?Deliberate disruptors typically use DDoS or destructive malware attacks to degrade or disrupt the event experience. Deliberate disruption includes ""for ransom"" activities and disinformation and misinformation campaigns, often using social media and possibly deepfake technologies, to dissuade or persuade their target audience of something (usually nefarious).Nation-state or state-affiliated threat actors are driven by national security, geopolitical positioning, and competitive advantage. These highly sophisticated cyber adversaries are drawn to large events due to their VIP audiences and the types of intelligence they can potentially collect.Don't Underestimate the Home-Team AdvantageWhile it's common to focus on threats from foreign cybercriminal enterprises looking to do harm, don't overlook often-inadvertent threat actors much closer to home.Employees with legitimate access to organizational resources can cause significant (usually unintentional) damage through mistakes and abuse of access privileges.A temporary workforce, brought on to cover increased staffing demand, may have similar access rights as full-time employees, but often undergo less scrutiny or security checks.Vendors and partners with physical or logical access to key resources can be a pivot point for threat actors through supply chain attacks. Vendors and partners are often prime targets for attackers on their own.How Cyber Adversaries Do HarmThe cyber adversary's playbook includes multiple tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).Targeting infrastructure provided by the event venue, city and state governments, and third parties (such as local businesses, sponsors, and hospitality providers). These can degrade or disable services, often with the intent of financial gain through ransomware or DDoS attacks.Increasing in social engineering campaigns using the event or related topics as lures to target and trick victims into giving up information including credentials or clicking links that trigger malware.Disseminating misinformation and disinformation — generally for ideology reasons, (geo)political motivation, or competitive advantage.Exfiltrating sensitive data to discredit, bribe, monetize, or coerce victims, often with a ransom demand asking for cryptocurrency payment.Strengthen the Human ElementWith the Super Bowl rolling into town, Las Vegas, already known for hospitality, will see a massive influx of guests. Cybercriminals often use social engineering techniques to target and defraud tourists because they may have a harder time distinguishing between legitimate and malicious communications while outside their normal routines. This makes them especially vulnerable and attractive to cybercriminals.Businesses must also be wary of social engineering in the runup to the ""Big Game."" Even though Las Vegas is home to some of the biggest hospitality brands in the world — companies with multimillion dollar cybersecurity budgets — social attacks can bypass even the most sophisticated security systems by targeting the biggest vulnerability of all: people.Businesses don't have time to do a complete cybersecurity overhaul ahead of Super Bowl weekend, but they do have time to remind employees of cybersecurity best practices. Social attacks can target virtually any employee, and an educated workforce helps mitigate risk.Employees who learn how to spot the most common social engineering tactics — phishing, vishing, smishing, pretexting — can help reduce points of entry. Remind employees to change passwords often and not use the same credentials across different systems and websites. If an employee's password has been compromised in another data breach, attackers can use it to gain access to your business.Also have incident response plans in place so that employees know how to respond if a suspicious incident happens. Having a plan can prevent a wider breach. Isolating incidents is just as important as preventing them.Consider Partners WiselyAttackers can also bypass sophisticated cybersecurity systems by targeting third-party vendors. Many major breaches are traced back to vulnerabilities in vendors with valuable data from larger companies. This should be a cause for concern for as Super Bowl event organizers, who work with a vast constellation of third-party vendors. While it's too late to reevaluate vendors now, there may be time to evaluate third-party exposure, touch base with vendor partners, and take measures to mitigate potential risk.Remove Weak LinksAn organization's cybersecurity is only as strong as its weakest links. Strong cybersecurity doesn't depend only on technology solutions; it's also about behaviors and culture. In that sense, cybersecurity is a manifestation of discipline. An organization may have rules to help prevent cyber incidents, but if they're not strictly and uniformly applied, its systems remain vulnerable. Threat actors are unlikely to change their tactics as long as they remain effective. Don't make it easy on them. Implement systems, establish protocols, make plans, and stick to them.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Google: Govs Drive Sharp Growth of Commercial Spyware Cos,"February 6, 2024Governments around the world, seeking to spy on rights activists, dissidents and others of interest to them, have driven a sharp proliferation in commercial spyware vendors (CSV) in recent years, with more and more cyber-weapons brokers wading into the market.What once used to be the domain of Israel-based NSO Group—the purveyor of the infamous Pegasus spyware program — and a handful of others, is now crowded with dozens of small CSVs with varying levels of sophistication and capabilities, according to Google's ""Buying Spying"" report released today. Their operations, though often targeted at only a relatively small number of individuals, have significantly broader repercussions, Google warned in a comprehensive new report on the troubling trend.""We have not seen evidence of CSV customers using spyware to attempt to hack the enterprise as a whole,"" a researcher from Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) tells Dark Reading.CSVs Account for Nearly Half of All Google 0-Day ExploitsOne of the biggest manifestations of the Internet-wide threat these vendors present is their role in finding and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in widely used products from Google, Apple, and numerous other major technology providers.Google identified CSVs as being behind nearly half of the known zero-day exploits — 35 out of 72 — in its technologies between mid-2014 and the end of 2023. CSVs also accounted for a stunning 20 out of the 25 total zero-day vulnerabilities that researchers from the Google TAG observed attackers exploiting in the wild last year. And even those numbers are almost certainly on the lower side, Google said.The rising alarm over the trend pushed the Biden Administration into issuing an Executive Order in March 2023 that is designed to counter and prevent the proliferation of commercial spyware products that pose a risk to activists, dissidents, journalists, and others. And in addition to Google's report, several other firms such as Apple, Toronto University's Citizen Labs, Cisco, the European Parliament, and the Carnegie Endowment have highlighted the rampant growth of CSV operations globally.A Spyware ExplosionMuch of the concern has to do with the explosion in the availability of tools and services that allow governments and law enforcement to break into target devices with impunity, harvest information from them, and spy unchecked on victims. The vendors selling these tools — most of which are designed for mobile devices — have often openly pitched their wares as legitimate tools that aid in law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts.But the reality is that repressive governments have routinely used spyware tools against journalists, activists, dissidents, and opposition party politicians, said Google.The company's report cites three instances of such misuse: one that targeted a human rights defender working with a Mexico-based rights organization; another against an exiled Russian journalist; and the third against the co-founder and director of a Salvadorian investigative news outlet.The Price Tag for End-to-End SurveillanceThe researcher attributes much of the recent growth in the CSV market to strong demand from governments around the world to outsource their need for spyware tools rather than have an advanced persistent threat build them in-house.""Governments no longer have to rely on building their own capabilities, but can purchase a contract for guaranteed exploits, and a full service tool from delivery to installation to analysis of the collected data,"" the Google TAG researcher says.Google's report pointed to Greece-based Intellexa, a vendor that the company and Amnesty International recently warned about, as an example of the end-to-end surveillance capabilities that CSVs can offer today for government customers — and the price tag for those services. ""For €8 million the customer receives the capability to use a remote one-click exploit chain to install spyware implants on Android and iOS devices, with the ability to run 10 concurrent spyware implants at any one time,"" Google said.The baseline price gives government and/or law enforcement users the ability to install and manage Intellexa's Nova system—which includes its Predator spyware implant and a data analysis system—on devices within the purchasing customers country and using the country's SIM cards. It also includes a one year maintenance guarantee, meaning that if a zero-day exploit the vendor might have used in the chain gets patched, the customer will get a new exploit, Google said.Customers willing to pay an additional €1.2 million (about $1.3 million) get the ability to infect Android and iOS devices in five additional countries and for another €3 million ($3.2 million) they get guaranteed persistence on target devices.""If [state-sponsored actors] ever had a monopoly on the most sophisticated capabilities, that era is certainly over,"" Google said in its report. ""The private sector is now responsible for a significant portion of the most sophisticated tools we detect.""The Exploitation Supply Chain GrowsIntellexa, which is actually an alliance of several CSVs, is not the only new entrant of note. Others include Negg Group of Italy; Spain-based Variston; and Cy4Gate, an Italian provider of spyware products for iOS and Android devices. In total, Google is tracking some 40 vendors that currently sell spyware products to governments and intelligence agencies worldwide.""While prominent CSVs like NSO Group garner public attention and headlines, there are dozens of smaller CSVs, as well as other important parts of the exploitation supply chain, which play an important role in the development of spyware,"" Google said. ""All these players enable the proliferation of dangerous tools and capabilities used by governments against individuals, which threatens the safety of the Internet ecosystem and the trust on which a vibrant and inclusive digital society depends.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

Mozilla adds paid-for data-deletion tier to Monitor service,"Mozilla adds paid-for data-deletion tier to Monitor, its privacy-breach radarFirefox maker promises to lean on personal info brokers to scrub recordsMozilla on Tuesday expanded its free privacy-monitoring service with a paid-for tier called Mozilla Monitor Plus that will try to get data brokers to delete their copies of subscribers' personal information.Mozilla introduced Monitor in 2018 as a way to make people aware when their personal info may have been stolen, leaked, and/or illicitly traded online. Called Firefox Monitor at launch, and now Mozilla Monitor, it provides a service that's not just similar to the venerable HaveIBeenPwned.com – it uses the HIBP database as its source. If your personal info gets stolen or leaked by cybercriminals, and a record of that privacy breach is added to HaveIBeenPwned, Monitor will automatically flag that up to you.Necessarily alert to revenue diversification opportunities in light of its dependence on Google paying to be the default search service on its beleaguered Firefox browser, Mozilla has taken Monitor beyond HIBP alerts, added data removal, and branded that expanded service Monitor Plus with a subscription fee of $8.99 per month (or $107.88 per year).The idea being that, for paying users, Monitor will do what it can to scrub their personal info from recognized data brokers that buy and sell netizens' details and records with other businesses, such as those folks' locations and online habits. While Monitor flags up criminal activity, Monitor Plus deals with removing info from ostensibly legit brokers; we can't imagine the org will have much success persuading underworld fraudsters to remove people's records.“When we launched Monitor, our goal was to help people discover where their personal info may have been exposed,"" said Tony Amaral-Cinotto, product manager of Mozilla Monitor, in an announcement. ""Now, with Monitor Plus, we’ll help people take back their exposed data from data broker sites that are trying to sell it.""In doing so, Mozilla joins more than a dozen other companies offering similar data removal services targeting a varying number of vendors, such as Abine's DeleteMe ($10.75 per month), Optery ($4-$25 per month), and Incogni ($6.49 per month), among others.These businesses contact data brokers and ask them to remove personal information (e.g. name, email, address, phone number) from their info stores on behalf of netizens, a time-consuming and onerous process if done manually.Mozilla claims Monitor Plus will work with over 190 data broker sites, ""twice the number of other competitors."" As a point of comparison, Opetery's top tier boasts removals from more than 305 sites, though at a cost of more than twice what Mozilla is asking. And that falls well short of the 549 data brokers currently registered in the State of California's Data Broker Registry, to say nothing of firms not doing business in the state or just operating illegally.So Mozilla Monitor Plus is an incomplete, temporary fix – sites may reacquire customer data, necessitating follow-up removal requests – in a largely unregulated data broker business that has made few accommodations to demands for privacy.- Brit watchdog thinks Google's tweaked Privacy Sandbox still isn't cricket- 'I'm sorry for everything...' Facebook's Zuck apologizes to families at Senate hearing- Microsoft Edge ignores user wishes, slurps tabs from Chrome without permission- Amazon Ring sounds death knell for surveillance as a serviceAnd the privacy situation has been grim for a while. A decade ago, in 2014, the FTC called on Congress to do something about the data broker industry. And not a lot has happened since.But by 2018, which saw Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal and the implementation of Europe's 2016 General Data Protection Regulation, demands for data privacy and protection began showing results.A year later, with browser rivals starting to block third-party cookies by default, Google saw the writing on the wall and set about designing its Privacy Sandbox advertising tools for a world grown wary of third-party tracking and data gathering.Lately, info brokers have received a lot of attention – not enough to merit an actual federal privacy law but more than usual for the intervention-averse US. The Federal Trade Commission recently banned X-Mode Social from sharing or selling location data.US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) called for domestic intelligence agencies to stop buying location data. And the Biden Administration is reportedly working on an executive order limiting data brokers from sharing or selling data on Americans to foreign adversaries.But the most significant development in the US in terms of data brokers has been California's Delete Act, which follows on the heels of the California Consumer Privacy Act and the state's Privacy Rights Act.The Delete Act technically became law this year but should start showing its teeth two years from now. Starting January 1, 2026, the California Privacy Protection Agency is supposed to deploy a one-stop data deletion mechanism to allow consumers to request that data brokers stop tracking them and delete their personal info. And by August 1 that year data brokers will be required to process people's deletion requests every 45 days.So two years hence or thereabout, Monitor Plus and related services may not be necessary for those in California – they'll no longer need to pay to recover the privacy taken from them without consent, at least with regard to third-party brokers.A Mozilla spokesperson told The Register the Delete Act is great news for Californians. ""Since the deletion mechanism will not be available until 2026, we wanted to ensure that people could begin protecting their privacy as quickly as possible, especially for people outside California who won't have this state protection,"" the spokesperson said. ®",security updates and patches,marketing,FALSE
Patch Now: Critical TeamCity Bug Allows for Server Takeovers,"February 7, 2024JetBrains has patched a critical security vulnerability in its TeamCity On-Premises server that can allow unauthenticated remote attackers to gain control over an affected server and use it to perform further malicious activity within an organization's environment.TeamCity is a software development lifecycle (SDLC) management platform that about 30,000 organizations — including several major brands like Citibank, Nike, and Ferrari — use to automate processes to build, test, and deploy software. As such, it's home to scores of data that can be useful to attackers, including source code and signing certificates, and also could allow for tampering with compiled versions software or deployment processes.The flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-23917, presents the weakness CWE-288, which is an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel. JetBrains identified the flaw on Jan. 19; it affects all versions from 2017.1 through 2023.11.2 of its TeamCity On-Premises continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) server.""If abused, the flaw may enable an unauthenticated attacker with HTTP(S) access to a TeamCity server to bypass authentication checks and gain administrative control of that TeamCity server,"" TeamCity's Daniel Gallo wrote in a blog post detailing CVE-2024-23917, published earlier this week.JetBrains already has released an update that addresses the vulnerability, TeamCity On-Premises version 2023.11.3, and also patched its own TeamCity Cloud servers. The company also verified that its own servers were not attacked.TeamCity's History of ExploitationIndeed, TeamCity On-Premises flaws are not to be taken lightly, as the last major flaw discovered in the product spurred a global security nightmare when various state-sponsored actors targeted it to engage in a range of malicious behavior.In that case, a public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for a critical remote code execution (RCE) bug tracked as CVE-2023-42793 — found by JetBrains and patched last Sept. 30 — triggered near immediate exploitation by two North Korean state-backed threat groups tracked by Microsoft as Diamond Sleet and Onyx Sleet. The groups exploited the flaw to drop backdoors and other implants for carrying out a wide range of malicious activities, including cyber espionage, data theft, and financially motivated attacks.Then in December, APT29 (aka CozyBear, the Dukes, Midnight Blizzard, or Nobelium), the notorious Russian threat group behind the 2020 SolarWinds hack, also pounced on the flaw. In activity tracked by CISA, the FBI, and the NSA, among others, the APT hammered vulnerable servers, using them for initial access to escalate privileges, move laterally, deploy additional backdoors, and take other steps to ensure persistent and long-term access to the compromised network environments.Update or Alternative Mitigation RecommendedHoping to avoid a similar scenario with its latest flaw, JetBrains urged anyone with affected products in their environment to immediately update to the patched version.If this isn't possible, JetBrains also released a security patch plugin that's available for download and can be installed on TeamCity versions 2017.1 through 2023.11.2 that will fix the issue. The company also posted installation instructions online for the plugin to help customers mitigate the issue.TeamCity stressed however that the security patch plugin will only address the vulnerability and not provide other fixes, so customers are highly recommended to install the latest version of TeamCity On-Premises ""to benefit from many other security updates,"" Gallo wrote.Further, if an organization has an affected server that is publicly accessible over the Internet and can't take either of those mitigation steps, JetBrains recommended that the server is made in accessible until the flaw can be mitigated.Considering the history of exploitation when it comes to TeamCity bugs, patching is a necessary and crucial first step that organizations need to take to handle the issue, Brian Contos, CSO at Sevco Security, observes. However, given that there could be Internet-facing servers that a company has lost track of, he suggests further steps may need to be taken to more firmly lock down an IT environment.""It's hard enough to defend the attack surface you know about, but it becomes impossible when there are vulnerable servers that don't show up on your IT asset inventory,"" Contos says. ""Once the patching is taken care of, security teams must turn their attention to a longer-term, more sustainable approach to vulnerability management.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,security updates and patches,FALSE
Linux Distros Hit by RCE Vulnerability in Shim Bootloader,"February 7, 2024Linux shim, a small piece of code that many major Linux distros use during the secure boot process, has a remote code execution vulnerability in it that gives attackers a way to take complete control of affected systems.All Linux distributions that support Secure Boot, including Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, and SUSE are affected by the flaw, identified as CVE-2023-40547. The flaw is the most severe of six vulnerabilities in Linux shim that its maintainer Red Hat disclosed recently — and for which it has issued an update (shim 15.8). Bill Demirkapi, a researcher with Microsoft's Security Response Center who discovered the bug and reported it to Red Hat, has described it as every Linux bootloader signed in the past decade.Out-of-Bounds Write ErrorIn its advisory Red Hat said the bug had to do with the shim boot code trusting attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response. ""This flaw allows an attacker to craft a specific malicious HTTP request, leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive and complete system compromise.""The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and Red Hat had slightly different takes on the severity of the vulnerability and its exploitability. The NVD assigned the bug a near maximum severity rating of 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS 3.1 scale and identified it as something that an attacker could exploit over the network with little complexity and requiring no user interaction or privileges.Red Hat gave the bug a more modest severity score of 8.3 and described it as exploitable only through an adjacent network and involving high attack complexity. It was an assessment that maintainers of the other affected Linux distros shared with Ubuntu, for instance, calling CVE-2023-40547 a ""medium"" severity bug and SUSE assigning it an ""important"" rating which typically is a notch lower than critical.Red Hat explained the different severity scores thusly: ""CVSS scores for open source components depend on vendor-specific factors (e.g. version or build chain). Therefore, Red Hat's score and impact rating can be different from NVD and other vendors."" Both the NVD and Red Hat though agreed on the vulnerability having a high impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.A shim bootloader is basically a small app that loads prior to the main operating system bootloader on Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)-based systems. It acts as a bridge between the UEFI firmware and the main OS bootloaders, which in the case of Linux, is typically GRUB or system-boot. Its function is to verify the main OS bootloader before loading and running it.Multiple Attack VectorsResearchers from software supply chain security vendor Eclypsium identified three different paths that an attacker could take to exploit the vulnerability. One is via a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, where the adversary intercepts HTTP traffic between the victim and the HTTP server that serves the files to support HTTP boot. ""The attacker could be located on any network segment between the victim and the legitimate server.""An attacker with enough privileges on a vulnerable system could also exploit the vulnerability locally by manipulating data in Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) variables or on the EFI partitions. ""This can be accomplished with a live Linux USB stick. The boot order can then be changed such that a remote and vulnerable shim is loaded on the system.""An attacker on the same network as the victim can also manipulate the pre-boot execution environment to chain-load a vulnerable shim bootloader, Eclypsium said. ""An attacker exploiting this vulnerability gains control of the system before the kernel is loaded, which means they have privileged access and the ability to circumvent any controls implemented by the kernel and operating system,"" the vendor noted.Exaggerated Severity?Some security experts, though, perceived the vulnerability as requiring a high degree of complexity and happenstance to exploit. Lionel Litty, chief security architect at Menlo Security, says the exploitation bar is high because the attacker would need to already have gained administrator privileges on a vulnerable device. Or they'd need to be targeting a device that uses network boot and also be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the local network traffic of the targeted device.""According to the researcher who found the vulnerability, a local attacker can modify the EFI partition to modify the boot sequence to then be able to leverage the vulnerability,"" Litty says. ""[But] modifying the EFI partition will require being a fully privileged admin on the victim machine,"" he says.If the device is using network boot and the attacker can do MITM on the traffic, then that's when they can target the buffer overflow. ""They would return a malformed HTTP response that would trigger the bug and give them control over the boot sequence at this point,"" Litty says. He adds that organizations with machines using HTTP boot or pre-boot execution environment (PXE) boot should be concerned, especially if communication with the boot sever is in an environment where an adversary could insert themselves into the middle of traffic.Shachar Menashe, senior director of security research at JFrog, says Red Hat's assessment of the vulnerability's severity is more accurate than NVDs ""over-exaggerated"" score.There are two possible explanations for the discrepancy, he says. ""NVD provided the score based on keywords from the description, and not a thorough analysis of the vulnerability,"" he says. For example, assuming that ""malicious HTTP request"" automatically translates to a network attack vector.NVD may also be alluding to an extremely unlikely worst-case scenario where the victim machine is already configured to boot via HTTP from a server outside the local network and the attacker already has control over this HTTP server. ""This is an extremely unlikely scenario which would cause tons of trouble even unrelated to this CVE,"" Shachar says.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",vulnerability reports,vulnerability reports,TRUE
Critical JetBrains TeamCity On-Premises Flaw Exposes Servers to Takeover - Patch Now,"JetBrains is alerting customers of a critical security flaw in its TeamCity On-Premises continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) software that could be exploited by threat actors to take over susceptible instances.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-23917, carries a CVSS rating of 9.8 out of 10, indicative of its severity.""The vulnerability may enable an unauthenticated attacker with HTTP(S) access to a TeamCity server to bypass authentication checks and gain administrative control of that TeamCity server,"" the company said.The issue impacts all TeamCity On-Premises versions from 2017.1 through 2023.11.2. It has been addressed in version 2023.11.3. An unnamed external security researcher has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on January 19, 2024.Users who are unable to update their servers to version 2023.11.3 can alternately download a security patch plugin to apply fixes for the flaw.""If your server is publicly accessible over the internet and you are unable to take one of the above mitigation steps immediately, we recommend temporarily making it inaccessible until mitigation actions have been completed,"" JetBrains advised.While there is no evidence that the shortcoming has been abused in the wild, a similar flaw in the same product (CVE-2023-42793, CVSS score: 9.8) came under active exploitation last year within days of public disclosure by multiple threat actors, including ransomware gangs and state-sponsored groups affiliated with North Korea and Russia.",emerging threats and attack techniques,security updates and patches,FALSE
"Critical Patches Released for New Flaws in Cisco, Fortinet, VMware Products","Cisco, Fortinet, and VMware have released security fixes for multiple security vulnerabilities, including critical weaknesses that could be exploited to perform arbitrary actions on affected devices.The first set from Cisco consists of three flaws – CVE-2024-20252 and CVE-2024-20254 (CVSS score: 9.6) and CVE-2024-20255 (CVSS score: 8.2) – impacting Cisco Expressway Series that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.All the issues, which were found during internal security testing, stem from insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface that could permit an attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.""If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts,"" Cisco said about CVE-2024-20252 and CVE-2024-20254.On the other hand, successful exploitation of CVE-2024-20255 targeting a user with administrative privileges could enable the threat actor to overwrite system configuration settings, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Another crucial difference between the two sets of flaws is that while the former two affect Cisco Expressway Series devices in the default configuration, CVE-2024-20252 only impacts them if the cluster database (CDB) API feature has been enabled. It's disabled by default.Patches for the vulnerabilities are available in Cisco Expressway Series Release versions 14.3.4 and 15.0.0.Fortinet, for its part, has released a second round of updates to address what are bypasses for a previously disclosed critical flaw (CVE-2023-34992, CVSS score: 9.7) in FortiSIEM supervisor that could result in the execution of arbitrary code, according to Horizon3.ai researcher Zach Hanley.It's worth noting that Fortinet resolved another variant of CVE-2023-34992 by closing out CVE-2023-36553 (CVSS score: 9.3) in November 2023. The two new vulnerabilities are/will be plugged in the following versions -- FortiSIEM version 7.1.2 or above- FortiSIEM version 7.2.0 or above (upcoming)- FortiSIEM version 7.0.3 or above (upcoming)- FortiSIEM version 6.7.9 or above (upcoming)- FortiSIEM version 6.6.5 or above (upcoming)- FortiSIEM version 6.5.3 or above (upcoming), and- FortiSIEM version 6.4.4 or above (upcoming)Completing the trifecta is VMware, which has warned of five moderate-to-important severity flaws in Aria Operations for Networks (formerly vRealize Network Insight) -- CVE-2024-22237 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a console user to gain regular root access- CVE-2024-22238 (CVSS score: 6.4) - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows a malicious actor with admin privileges to inject malicious code into user profile configurations- CVE-2024-22239 (CVSS score: 5.3) - Local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a console user to gain regular shell access- CVE-2024-22240 (CVSS score: 4.9) - Local file read vulnerability that allows a malicious actor with admin privileges to access sensitive information- CVE-2024-22241 (CVSS score: 4.3) - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows a malicious actor with admin privileges to inject malicious code and take over the user accountTo mitigate the risks, all users of VMware Aria Operations for Networks version 6.x are being recommended to upgrade to version 6.12.0.Considering the history of exploitation when it comes to Cisco, Fortinet, and VMware flaws, patching is a necessary and crucial first step that organizations need to take to handle the shortcomings.",marketing,security updates and patches,FALSE
US snares bug hunter for alleged multimillion Apple fraud,"Cybercrime duo accused of picking $2.5M from Apple's orchardSecurity researcher buddies allegedly tag team a four-month virtual gift card heist at Cupertino tech giantA cybersecurity researcher and his pal are facing charges in California after they allegedly defrauded an unnamed company, almost certainly Apple, out of $2.5 million.Noah Roskin-Frazee and Keith Latteri are alleged to have gained access to Apple's systems via a third-party contractor and ordered gift cards and hardware to the value of $2.5 million and $100,000 respectively.They are then said to have sold their stolen wares to third parties, cashing out on their theft and defrauding both Apple and the customer support business it contracted out of millions.While Apple isn't explicitly named in the recently unsealed court papers, it's not difficult to deduce that the identity of ""Company A,"" as written in the indictment, is the consumer tech megacorp.""Company A was a corporation headquartered in Cupertino, California, which developed, manufactured, licensed, supported, and sold computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and services,"" the indictment reads, describing Company A. Seems pretty Apple-y so far.Looking deeper into the case background, it's also revealed that one of the defendants redeemed one of the stolen gift cards to their personal app store account, where they purchased Final Cut Pro – software developed by Apple that only runs on Apple hardware.Roskin-Frazee and Latteri were able to order the glut of gift cards and hardware because they had access to a number of key Apple backend systems.One of these is a Log Program that allows customer support to search Apple products and order replacements. Another is the Toolbox program which allows customer support staff to edit orders for a limited time after they're made.The final important system at play here is the Jamf MDM platform, which is operated by the third-party contractor and allows configuration changes to be made to Apple devices, but that's not what it was used for in this case.How the scam unfoldedThe first port of call was gaining access to the contractor's systems. The pair allegedly did this by using what the court papers [PDF] describe as a password reset tool on a targeted account. From there, the pair used that first compromised account to unearth credentials for other staff accounts that, crucially, also had credentials for the company's VPN servers.Once connected to the customer support contractor's VPN, they could also access the company's remote desktop software, which they used to control computers owned by the contractor that were located in India and Costa Rica. The contractor's Jamf MDM platform was used to access these computers and log them into desktop sharing sessions.Malicious scripts were run to create a reverse SSH tunnel between the Indian and Costa Rican computers and the accused's Microsoft Azure account, which allowed continued remote access between around December 2018 and March 2019.These remotely operated computers, run using the contractor's legitimate credentials and VPN server, were used to gain access to what the court documents describe as ""Company A's Connect application,"" which is probably Apple's App Store Connect. With this access, Roskin-Frazee and Latteri were able to take control of Toolbox and manipulate orders, it is alleged.After the pair and their family members, using fake names and email addresses, placed more than two dozen orders through Apple, Roskin-Frazee and Latteri allegedly used Toolbox to make critical order amendments during the short window of opportunity. These included extending existing service contracts, adding more products to the orders, and changing all prices to zero.- Verizon says 63K employees' info fell into the wrong hands – an insider this time- Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong acquitted of stock manipulation charges- Fujitsu finance chief says sorry for IT giant's role in Post Office Horizon scandal- SolarWinds slams SEC lawsuit against it as 'unprecedented' victim blamingTransshipment companies Shipito LLC and Amboy Technologies LLC were used to ship the products while concealing the pair's addresses – another means of hiding their identities. Amboy was the first port of call, but the fake account the pair created with the company was terminated due to fraud concerns. However, they later allegedly had more success using Shipito.Apple says 'thanks'?Funnily enough, in a December 2023 security update – published one day before Roskin-Frazee's indictment – Apple acknowledged the security researcher, and his colleague ""Prof. J."" of ZeroClicks Lab, for reporting a bug affecting macOS Ventura that could have allowed an app to access data from a user's contacts.The issue is tracked as CVE-2023-42894 – not the most serious bug in the world but serves as a rare oddity in the world of cybercrime where it's highly unusual for an alleged criminal to be thanked for ethical research after they had spent months allegedly defrauding the very same company years earlier.Roskin-Frazee was also solely credited with the finding of CVE-2023-38593, a denial of service vulnerability impacting iOS and iPadOS earlier in July 2023.Roskin-Frazee was a legitimate, recognized security researcher who had also led talks at conferences such as ISACA's Digital Trust World Europe Conference in Dublin last year.Neither Apple nor the lawyers for Roskin-Frazee and Latteri immediately responded to requests for comment. ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

'Ov3r_Stealer' Malware Spreads Through Facebook to Steal Crates of Info,"A tangled web of attackers use various social media tactics to propagate the novel threat, which has several execution methods and exfiltrates data to Telegram.February 8, 2024A novel stealer malware called ""Ov3r_Stealer"" is making the rounds on Facebook, spreading through job ads and accounts on the social media platform, and using various execution methods to steal reams of data from unwitting victims.The malware by design exfiltrates specific types of data such as geolocation (based on IP), hardware info, passwords, cookies, credit card information, auto-fills, browser extensions, crypto wallets, Office documents, and antivirus product information, according to researchers from Trustwave SpiderLabs. It sends the info a Telegram channel being monitored by the threat actors.The researchers first discovered the stealer in early December. It was being spread via a Facebook job advertisement for an account manager position, they revealed in a blog post and report published this week. Later, they discovered that the actors behind the malware also use Facebook-based scams — including the creation of fake accounts — to spread the malware.Eventually, weaponized links delivered through the ad lead to a malicious Discord content-delivery URL, which executed the stealer using a PowerShell script masquerading as a Windows Control Panel (CPL) binary to download the malware, in the form of three files from a GitHub site.But what really sets Ov3r_Stealer apart is having several execution methods. In addition to the PowerShell vector, Ov3r_Stealer also can be executed on a victim's machine via HTML smuggling, SVG image smuggling, and .LNK shortcut files masquerading as innocuous text documents.Down the Cyberattacker Rabbit HoleOnce researchers followed the stolen data to Telegram, they found a rather complex origin story behind Ov3r_Stealer, as the malware appears to have a range of threat actors behind it who conspire via multiple communication channels and platforms.Specifically, the researchers uncovered various pseudonyms, communication channels, and repositories for the stolen data that hold clues to who's behind it and how they work.""Aliases such as 'Liu Kong,' 'MR Meta,' MeoBlackA, and 'John Macollan' were found in groups like 'Pwn3rzs Chat,' 'Golden Dragon Lounge,' 'Data Pro,' and 'KGB Forums,' where many 'researchers,' threat actors, and curious folk gather, meetup, and exchange hacks, malware, and cracked software daily,"" according to the report.It's unknown exactly how attackers use the data once it's stolen, but possibilities including selling it or using it for phishing. To boot, Ov3r_Stealer can also be used in a modular way as a dropper for other malware or post-exploit tools, up to and including ransomware, the researchers said.Ov3r_Stealer's Various Execution StrategiesAs mentioned, once a victim is compromised, the stealer uses several unique execution methods; the researchers observed one and gleaned a few others from sample code. One loader used Windows CPL files — which are generally used for system settings within Windows — to run a remote PowerShell script to download the malware's three files.Another method indicated by sample data is through HTML smuggling, which uses a weaponized HTML file, CustomCursor.html, to load the CustomCursor.zip file that includes the malware files.A third execution method is through a shortcut file (.LNK). The victim is presented with a file masquerading as a typical text file called Attitude_Reports.txt, located within a zip archive. The actual file within the zip archive, however, is a malicious .LNK file called Attitude_Reports.txt.lnk. Once opened, it will redirect the victim to the GitHub repository, as the CPL loader does, to download the actual payload.Attackers also use a technique called SVG smuggling to execute the file in a method that exploits the WinRAR Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2023-38831). This method works similarly to HTML smuggling, except that the malicious files are embedded within a vector graphics file (SVG). This redirects to a “Copyright_Report.svg"" file that, once opened, embeds and loads a .RAR file that contains a Windows .LNK shortcut file to download a PowerShell script to deliver the payload.That final payload is ultimately delivered in three files that are nested: WerFaultSecure.exe, a legitimate Windows executable; Wer.dll, a malicious file that WerFaultSecure loads; and Secure.pdf, which contains malicious code that Wer.dll will load.Once executed, the malware will establish persistence through the copying of its files to the C:\Users\Public\Libraries\Books folder and the creation of a Windows scheduled task called ""Licensing2"" which runs every 90 minutes to ensure continuous data exfiltration.A Malware Poised to Go BigThough Trustwave has not yet seen wide-ranging campaigns using this malware, the researchers believe it remains under continual development and continues to pose an existing threat. They included a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) in their report to help organizations identify the malware in their environment.""As Ov3r_Stealer has been actively developed with multiple loader techniques, we may see this one eventually be sold or used in other campaigns in the future,"" according to the report.To avoid compromise or mitigate attacks by Ov3r_Stealer, Trustwave recommended that organizations implement ""active and engaging"" security awareness programs to help people spot malicious campaigns on social media and other attacker strategies.Organizations also should use regular application and service audits and baselining, as well as practice up-to-date application patching to mitigate threats, the researchers added. Further, they should continuously hunt threats throughout their environments to pick up undetected compromises before they have time to do damage, they added.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",vulnerability reports,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Unified Identity – look for the meaning behind the hype!,"If you've listened to software vendors in the identity space lately, you will have noticed that ""unified"" has quickly become the buzzword that everyone is adopting to describe their portfolio. And this is great! Unified identity has some amazing benefits!However (there is always a however, right?) not every ""unified"" ""identity"" ""security"" ""platform"" is made equal. Some vendors call the combination of workforce IDaaS and customer IDaaS a unified identity solution, while others offer a glorified 2FA service – unified only in the mind of their marketers.Your landscape matters!So forget for a moment what the vendors claim, and think back to your organization and your identity security landscape. Consider this new definition: ""unified"" is what has the ability to consolidate your identity challenges with a complete identity solution.Here's an example: you're responsible for the identity infrastructure of a large hospital. Frontline workers, administrative employees, audit/compliance needs and a large number of external users. You are using Active Directory, and your LOB application doesn't do identity. For this hospital, unified identity means strong access management for customers and frontline workers, strong joiner-leaver-mover handling, AD hardening and enterprise-grade reporting. Anything less fails the unified promise and means their internal identity landscape stays fractured.Another example: a small software dev studio. They need extra strong controls on Privileged Access Management (PAM) to protect the development pipeline and make sure they won't become the initial attack vector in a supply chain attack. But they also need Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) for machine entities and their owners, working on the many automated tasks they are running. A solution which covers PAM and IGA independently from each other is not unified.What is the value of unified identity anyways?So why has ""unified identity "" become such a hot buzzword? Well, there are some really good arguments for it. Traditionally, the identity space was very fractured, with many experts not even considering it a singular market until fairly recently. Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), Access Management (AM), and Privileged Access Management (PAM) were the key sub-markets, with a wide array of adjacent spaces such as AD bridging and endpoint privilege management.The key driver for unified identity is this extreme fragmentation: a large organization has on average 45 different security tools. Add to this the identity sprawl, a trend where organizations keep getting more and more identity silos in-house – a One Identity survey shows half the organizations are using more than 25 different systems to manage access rights. This is simply not sustainable, and adding a new tool each time a new threat approaches is completely unworkable. So organizations are looking to consolidate vendors, reduce complexity and slim down the number of suppliers they work with. The benefits of a Unified Identity Platform are a better cybersecurity posture and greater resilience in the face of security threats, whilst increasing simplicity and enabling agility.Another reason is top line cost: bundles, volume discounts and ELAs are a simple way to reduce costs. Vendor consolidation also brings some less obvious savings too: a single tech stack helps the skills gap, easing the stress on hiring and training, which in turn means significant savings on headcount and may lessen the requirement for highly trained senior staff, creating more value from security with less resources or put another way, working smarter not harder.Integration is a key aspect of the identity landscape – and one of the largest headaches. Security tools need to work together smoothly, but that's rarely a given. The industry is not keen on common standards, which makes interoperability very hard to achieve. With some effort (meaning customization, support hours and overhead) identity solutions can work together pairwise, but creating a complete ecosystem of identity tools that work flawless together is a rare achievement. It's easy to see the value a unified identity platform brings here. The tools are pre-tested, pre-validated to work together, usually without any customization required, and the platform components are supported as one by the vendor.This brings us to the final benefit: faster time to value, an expression worthy of any MBA graduate. Identity and access management (IAM) projects are famous for taking a long time to implement, as specialists meticulously formalize business processes and implement them in code or configuration. In large organizations, this is an incredibly complex task, as the IAM setup needs to mirror every aspect (and quirk) the business has built up – sometimes over decades. Implementations become so complex that they just fail – the cost and time overruns exceeding the patience of business leaders. In a nutshell: time to value matters in IAM. And a unified identity solution removes the complexity of the multi-vendor approach, eliminating at least one factor.After these benefits, let's talk a downside: vendor lock-in. Unified identity sounds wonderful but betting the house on a single vendor is a high ask. And what if you already have some solutions in place that you're happy with? It's important to remember that not all unified identity vendors are the same; Some vendors offer modular identity platforms which allow you to keep what you want and unify what you need. This approach enables customers to start the unification at any point (for example with PAM) without the need to embrace and implement all areas in one giant leap. When picking vendors, look for this flexible approach.",emerging threats and attack techniques,marketing,FALSE
Billington CyberSecurity to Host 1st State and Local Cyber Summit in Wake of Serious Cyberattacks,"February 8, 2024PRESS RELEASEWASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The inaugural Billington State and Local CyberSecurity Summit will be held on March 19-20, 2024 at the National Press Club in Washington, DC as well as virtually. The two-day summit will convene the senior-most cyber leaders who will discuss cybersecurity issues and solutions for government entities at the state and local level.“Keeping our nation safe from cyber criminals also means keeping state and local governments safe from these bad actors,” explained Thomas K. Billington, CEO and Founder, Billington CyberSecurity, a leading cyber education company for executives founded in 2010. “With the increased attacks on our infrastructure, this new conference explores ways to protect our localities as well as the cyber issues they grapple with on a daily basis.”State and local governments and the critical infrastructure they support are facing significant cyber-attacks. In the last year, the state of Illinois, the city of Dallas, and the Los Angeles Unified School District have experienced cyber-attacks that impacted their day-to-day operations over multiple weeks. Yet these same governments are often massively under-resourced to protect themselves.Government officials, tech leaders, and academia will be participating in Billington’s two-day summit and sharing ways to enhance the cybersecurity of the states, counties, cities, and municipalities that comprise the U.S. and the critical infrastructure sectors. More than 30 cyber leaders will be speaking, including:Vitaliy Panych, CISO, State of CaliforniaNancy Rainosek, State Chief Information Security Officer, Texas Department of Information ResourcesColin Ahern, Chief Cyber Officer, State of New YorkChris DeRusha, Federal CISO, OMB (invited pending agency approval)Katie Savage, Secretary, CIO, Maryland Department of ITSteven Hernandez, CISO, Department of EducationWilliam Zielinksi, CIO, City of DallasBess Mitchell, Chief, Grant Operations, DHSNishant Shah, Senior Advisor for Responsible AI, State of MarylandJosiah Raiche, Director of Artificial Intelligence, State of VermontThe summit takes place at the National Press Club at 529 14th St NW, Washington, DC.

New Fortinet RCE flaw in SSL VPN likely exploited in attacks,"Fortinet is warning that a new critical remote code execution vulnerability in FortiOS SSL VPN is potentially being exploited in attacks.The flaw (tracked as CVE-2024-21762 / FG-IR-24-015) received a 9.6 severity rating and is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in FortiOS that allows unauthenticated attackers to gain remote code execution (RCE) via maliciously crafted requests.To patch the bug, Fortinet recommends upgrading to one of the latest version based on this table:|Version|Affected|Solution|FortiOS 7.6|Not affected|Not Applicable|FortiOS 7.4|7.4.0 through 7.4.2|Upgrade to 7.4.3 or above|FortiOS 7.2|7.2.0 through 7.2.6|Upgrade to 7.2.7 or above|FortiOS 7.0|7.0.0 through 7.0.13|Upgrade to 7.0.14 or above|FortiOS 6.4|6.4.0 through 6.4.14|Upgrade to 6.4.15 or above|FortiOS 6.2|6.2.0 through 6.2.15|Upgrade to 6.2.16 or above|FortiOS 6.0|6.0 all versions|Migrate to a fixed releaseFor those unable to apply patches, you can mitigate the flaw by disabling SSL VPN on your FortiOS devices.Fortinet's advisory does not provide any details on how the vulnerability is being exploited or who discovered the vulnerability.This flaw was disclosed today along with CVE-2024-23113 (Critical/9.8 rating), CVE-2023-44487 (Medium), and CVE-2023-47537 (Medium). However, these flaws are not marked as being exploited in the wild.Threat actors commonly target Fortinet flaws to breach corporate networks for ransomware attacks and cyber espionage.Yesterday, Fortinet disclosed that Chinese state-sponsored threat actors known as Volt Typhoon targeted FortiOS vulnerabilities to deploy custom malware known as COATHANGER.This malware is a custom remote access trojan (RAT) designed to infect Fortigate network security appliances and was recently found used in attacks on the Dutch Ministry of Defence.Due to the high severity of the newly disclosed CVE-2024-21762 flaw and the likelihood of it being exploited in attacks, it is strongly advised that you update your devices as soon as possible.CommentsNocturnal - 23 hours agoAre there any ioc published yet?",news and industry updates,security updates and patches,FALSE
Raspberry Robin Malware Upgrades with Discord Spread and New Exploits,"The operators of Raspberry Robin are now using two new one-day exploits to achieve local privilege escalation, even as the malware continues to be refined and improved to make it stealthier than before.This means that ""Raspberry Robin has access to an exploit seller or its authors develop the exploits themselves in a short period of time,"" Check Point said in a report this week.Raspberry Robin (aka QNAP worm), first documented in 2021, is an evasive malware family that's known to act as one of the top initial access facilitators for other malicious payloads, including ransomware.Attributed to a threat actor named Storm-0856 (previously DEV-0856), it's propagated via several entry vectors, including infected USB drives, with Microsoft describing it as part of a ""complex and interconnected malware ecosystem"" with ties to other e-crime groups like Evil Corp, Silence, and TA505.Raspberry Robin's use of one-day exploits such as CVE-2020-1054 and CVE-2021-1732 for privilege escalation was previously highlighted by Check Point in April 2023.The cybersecurity firm, which detected ""large waves of attacks"" since October 2023, said the threat actors have implemented additional anti-analysis and obfuscation techniques to make it harder to detect and analyze.""Most importantly, Raspberry Robin continues to use different exploits for vulnerabilities either before or only a short time after they were publicly disclosed,"" it noted.""Those one-day exploits were not publicly disclosed at the time of their use. An exploit for one of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-36802, was also used in the wild as a zero-day and was sold on the dark web.""A report from Cyfirma late last year revealed that an exploit for CVE-2023-36802 was being advertised on dark web forums in February 2023. This was seven months before Microsoft and CISA released an advisory on active exploitation. It was patched by the Windows maker in September 2023.Raspberry Robin is said to have started utilizing an exploit for the flaw sometime in October 2023, the same month a public exploit code was made available, as well as for CVE-2023-29360 in August. The latter was publicly disclosed in June 2023, but an exploit for the bug did not appear until September 2023.It's assessed that the threat actors purchase these exploits rather than developing them in-house owing to the fact that they are used as an external 64-bit executable and are not as heavily obfuscated as the malware's core module.""Raspberry Robin's ability to quickly incorporate newly disclosed exploits into its arsenal further demonstrates a significant threat level, exploiting vulnerabilities before many organizations have applied patches,"" the company said.One of the other significant changes concerns the initial access pathway itself, leveraging rogue RAR archive files containing Raspberry Robin samples that are hosted on Discord.Also modified in the newer variants is the lateral movement logic, which now uses PAExec.exe instead of PsExec.exe, and the command-and-control (C2) communication method by randomly choosing a V3 onion address from a list of 60 hardcoded onion addresses.""It starts with trying to contact legitimate and well-known Tor domains and checking if it gets any response,"" Check Point explained.

Raspberry Pi Pico cracks BitLocker in under a minute,"Windows encryption feature defeated by $10 and a YouTube tutorialWe're very familiar with the many projects in which Raspberry Pi hardware is used, from giving old computers a new lease of life through to running the animated displays so beloved by retailers. But cracking BitLocker? We doubt the company will be bragging too much about that particular application.The technique was documented in a YouTube video over the weekend, which demonstrated how a Raspberry Pi Pico can be used to gain access to a BitLocker-secured device in under a minute, provided you have physical access to the device.A Lenovo laptop was used in the video, posted by user stacksmashing, although other hardware will also be vulnerable. The technique also relies on having a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) separate from the CPU. In many cases, the two will be combined, in which case the technique shown cannot be used.However, if you get your hands on a similarly vulnerable device secured with BitLocker, gaining access to the encrypted storage appears embarrassingly simple. The crux of it is sniffing out the key to the device as it is passed from TPM to CPU. The key is helpfully not encrypted.This particular laptop had connections that could be put to use alongside a custom connector to access the signals between chips. Stir in an analyzer running on the Raspberry Pi Pico and for less than $10 in components, you can get hold of the master key for the laptop hardware.- Raspberry Pi on IPO plans: 'We want to be ready when the markets are ready'- Techie resurrects teletext on a vintage BBC Master- Eben Upton on Sinclair, Acorn, and the Raspberry Pi- Raspberry Pi sizes up HAT+ spec for future hardware add-onsMicrosoft has long accepted that such attacks are possible, although it describes them as a ""targeted attack with plenty of time; the attacker opens the case, solder, and uses sophisticated hardware or software.""At less than a minute in the example, we'd dispute the ""plenty of time"" claim, and while the Raspberry Pi Pico is undoubtedly impressive for the price, at less than $10, the hardware spend is neither expensive nor specific.If your hardware is vulnerable, mitigation can be achieved through the use of a PIN.It's enough to send administrators scurrying to their inventory lists to check for hardware they would be forgiven for assuming had been safely encrypted.As one wag observed: ""Congratulations!

Fake app impersonating LastPass spotted in Apple's App Store,"Fake LastPass lookalike made it into Apple App StoreNo walled garden can keep out every weed, we supposeLastPass says a rogue application impersonating its popular password manager made it past Apple's gatekeepers and was listed in the iOS App Store for unsuspecting folks to download and install.The software maker went public about the fake mobile app on Wednesday, warning that the knockoff ""LastPass Password Manager,"" developed by someone calling themselves Parvati Patel, appeared to be trying to confuse users into running the thing and possibly steal their data or credentials.A screenshot of the fake LastPass app in the Apple App store. Note the misspellings, incorrect developer name and single rating ... Click to enlarge""Upon seeing the fake 'LassPass' app in the Apple App store, LastPass immediately began a coordinated and multi-faceted approach across our threat intelligence, legal and engineering teams to get the fraudulent app removed,"" Christofer Hoff, chief secure technology officer for LastPass, told The Register Thursday.""We are in direct contact with representatives from Apple, and they have confirmed receipt of our complaints, and we are working through the process to have the fraudulent app removed,"" Hoff added.Cupertino may have been on the case but earlier today the app was still available in the store. El Reg asked Apple why the fake LastPass app was still up, and while we didn't receive a response, the app's URL stopped working and the application disappeared from App Store search results on an iPhone within a few minutes of our email.In other words, it's now gone.How'd this weed make it into the walled garden?Apps of questionable value aside, Apple has a reputation for being a relatively safe place for the average iPerson to get their software, with a notoriously tough app approval process standing between developers and users.Apple even updated its developer agreement and review guidelines last year to add a specific prohibition on apps that impersonate others. The design section of the app review guidelines even calls out developers who take such an approach, though it's more concerned with laziness than maliciousness.""Come up with your own ideas,"" Apple demands from developers. ""Submitting apps which impersonate other apps or services is considered a violation of the Developer Code of Conduct and may result in removal from the Apple Developer Program.""Of course, the system isn't perfect, and the occasional weed gets through the wall and into the garden. LastPass' impersonator isn't the first, though it is a particularly egregious case.- Forcing Apple to allow third-party app stores isn't enough- Beware cool-looking beta crypto-apps. They may be money-stealing fakes- Almost 300 predatory loan apps found in Google and Apple stores- Over a million Android users fooled by fake WhatsApp app in official Google Play StoreWhile it's understandable some questionable IP theft could occur on the App Store on occasion, this is a total impersonation of a well-known brand. We'd love to know how this blunder happened, though we're unlikely to get an answer. LastPass wants to know too.""[We're] working with Apple to understand more broadly how an application like this passed their normally rigorous security and brand protection mechanisms,"" Hoff told us. ""The naming convention, the iconography and the description of the fraudulent app are all heavily borrowed from LastPass, and this appears to be a deliberate attempt to target LastPass users.""Separating the apps from the trapsEven with its insistence that opening the App Store to competition would lead to greater threats to user safety, Apple's content rules still aren't completely solid. While we're confident that our readers know well how to spot a fake app from a real one, it's worth reminding everyone how to avoid being tricked into downloading a fake - and this fake LastPass app is rife with examples.There's the obvious signs, like misspellings in app descriptions or in screenshots. The fake LastPass app, screenshotted in this story, actually shows a preview image telling users they can ""store all your passwords with lasspass"" - a good way to tell you're dealing with a faker, assuming legitimate developers have an editor.There's also the developer name, which in LastPass' case should be ""LogMeIn, Inc.,"" not a random person. Other apps from big providers (the most obvious ones to be targeted for impersonation) should likewise match the actual company behind the product.The fake LastPass app also only showed itself as having a single five-star rating, while the real LastPass app has some 52k reviews. A legitimate app is unlikely please everyone, either, and LastPass is no different - the real app is rated 4.4 out of five stars.Additionally, four one-star reviews on the fake LastPass app that didn't seem to affect its overall score came from users warning that it was a scam, so there's two lessons to learn here: Pay attention to the number of reviews on a supposedly legitimate app, and give them a read, too.Along with those elements, look at the age of the app, and also take a look at the app privacy report baked into every page in the App Store - if an app doesn't seem like it needs to link certain types of data to you (sudoku doesn't need to access user content or know your location), then skip it - even if legit the developer might be selling your data.As high as they may be, the walls around Tim's garden can't keep out all the garbage, so be careful. ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Microsoft unveils new 'Sudo for Windows' feature in Windows 11,"Microsoft introduced 'Sudo for Windows' today, a new Windows 11 feature allowing users to execute commands with elevated privileges from unelevated terminals.""Sudo for Windows is a new way for users to run elevated commands directly from an unelevated console session,"" said Windows Product Manager Jordi Adoumie.""It is an ergonomic and familiar solution for users who want to elevate a command without having to first open a new elevated console.""The new Sudo tool is rolling out to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels running Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26052.""This project is not a fork of the Linux sudo project, nor is it a port of the Linux sudo project. Instead, Sudo for Windows is a Windows-specific implementation of the sudo concept,"" Microsoft explains.""As the two are entirely different applications, you'll find that certain elements of the Linux sudo experience are not present in Sudo for Windows, and vice versa.""Since Linux sudo and Sudo for Windows are different beasts, scripts written for Linux sudo may not work with Sudo for Windows without some (heavy?) modification.Those who want to enable the sudo command on their system have to go to Settings > For Developers page in the Windows Settings app and toggle the ""Enable Sudo"" option.It can be configured to run applications in a new elevated console window, in the same window but with input disabled, or inline (the new elevated process takes input and routes output to the current window).After elevating a new process using sudo, a UAC dialog will appear to ask the user for confirmation and escalate privileges once confirmed, using the configuration option the user selected.Microsoft says the setting for enabling sudo may incorrectly show up on Windows Server Insider Preview builds. However, sudo will not be available on Windows Server, and this setting will be disabled in a future Server Insider Preview build.Sudo for Windows was accidentally revealed by Microsoft two weeks ago, together with some other in-development features, and was first spotted by Albacore while looking into changes added to updated language packs included with a leaked Windows Server 2025 Insider preview build.""Over the coming months we will be working on expanding documentation for Sudo for Windows and will be sharing more details about the security implications of running sudo in the 'Inline' configuration,"" Adoumie said.""Our team is working on open-sourcing Sudo for Windows and we're excited to share more details about our plans in the coming months.""Commentswpontius - 1 day agoUnneeded , Windows already has ways to run with elevated privileges.

Kimsuky's New Golang Stealer 'Troll' and 'GoBear' Backdoor Target South Korea,"The North Korea-linked nation-state actor known as Kimsuky is suspected of using a previously undocumented Golang-based information stealer called Troll Stealer.The malware steals ""SSH, FileZilla, C drive files/directories, browsers, system information, [and] screen captures"" from infected systems, South Korean cybersecurity company S2W said in a new technical report.Troll Stealer's links to Kimsuky stem from its similarities to known malware families, such as AppleSeed and AlphaSeed malware that have been attributed to the group.Kimsuky, also tracked under the names APT43, ARCHIPELAGO, Black Banshee, Emerald Sleet (previously Thallium), Nickel Kimball, and Velvet Chollima, is well known for its propensity to steal sensitive, confidential information in offensive cyber operations.In late November 2023, the threat actors were sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for gathering intelligence to further North Korea's strategic objectives.S2W's latest analysis reveals the use of a dropper that masquerades as a security program installation file from a South Korean company named SGA Solutions to launch the stealer, which gets its name from the path ""D:/~/repo/golang/src/root.go/s/troll/agent"" that's embedded in it.""The dropper runs as a legitimate installer alongside the malware, and both the dropper and malware are signed with a valid, legitimate D2Innovation Co.,LTD' certificate, suggesting that the company's certificate was actually stolen,"" the company said.A stand-out feature of Troll Stealer is its ability to pilfer the GPKI certificates issued by the South Korean government from infected systems, indicating that the malware may been put to use in attacks targeting administrative and public organizations in the country.Given the absence of Kimsuky campaigns documenting the theft of GPKI folders, it has raised the possibility that the new behavior is either a shift in tactics or the work of another threat actor closely associated with the group that also has access to the source code of AppleSeed and AlphaSeed.There are also signs that the threat actor may be involved with a Go-based backdoor codenamed GoBear that's also signed with a legitimate certificate associated with D2Innovation Co., LTD and executes instructions received from a command-and-control (C2) server.""The strings contained in the names of the functions it calls have been found to overlap with the commands used by BetaSeed, a C++-based backdoor malware used by the Kimsuky group,"" S2W said.

Raspberry Robin devs are buying exploits for faster attacks,"One of most important malware loaders to cybercrims who are jumping on vulnerabilities faster than everResearchers suspect the criminals behind the Raspberry Robin malware are now buying exploits for speedier cyberattacks.An exploit developer is thought by infosec pros to be either on the Raspberry Robin payroll or a close contact that sells them to the group – most likely the latter. That's according to Check Point Research (CPR) which has tracked how long it takes for vulnerability exploits to be added as features to the malware.It means the criminals behind it are prioritizing the speed of development to maximize their chances of successful attacks.""Raspberry Robin continues to use different exploits for vulnerabilities either before or only a short time after they were publicly disclosed,"" said CPR. ""Those one-day exploits were not publicly disclosed at the time of their use. An exploit for one of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-36802, was also used in the wild as a zero-day and was sold on the dark web.""Very few knew about CVE-2023-36802 until Microsoft addressed it as part of its September 2023 Patch Tuesday updates. However, Cyfirma spotted an exploit for it being sold on the dark web as early as February of that year, seven months before the security advisories began popping up.The earliest signs of Raspberry Robin abusing CVE-2023-36802 came in October, just weeks after Patch Tuesday and the same month that public exploit code was made available.Researchers believe this points to the team's access to a developer given the time it took to start making use of the vulnerability, especially compared to a year earlier when it was using year-old vulns.It is possible the Raspberry Robin team stumbled upon the February exploit and bought that, or someone in-house may have quickly developed their own after spotting it in Microsoft's update list, but this is seen as the less likely option.Another case from earlier in 2023 also pointed to the possibility of Raspberry Robin's ties to sophisticated developers.""After looking at samples of Raspberry Robin prior to October, we found that it also used an exploit for CVE-2023-29360,"" said CPR. ""This vulnerability was publicly disclosed in June and was used by Raspberry Robin in August. Even though this is a pretty easy vulnerability to exploit, the fact that the exploit writer had a working sample before there was a known exploit in GitHub is impressive as is how quickly Raspberry Robin used it.- Psst … wanna jailbreak ChatGPT? Thousands of malicious prompts for sale- Why we update... Data-thief malware exploits SmartScreen on unpatched Windows PCs- A tale of 2 casino ransomware attacks: One paid out, one did not- Something nasty injected login-stealing JavaScript into 50K online banking sessions""This exploit also has the same loader and the same obfuscation scheme for the strings as the CVE-2023-36802 exploit and the flow is similar. Interestingly, this vulnerability is also in the mskssrv.sys, meaning the exploit writer is working on this driver. We may see other vulnerabilities in the driver being exploited in the wild.""Analysis of the malware showed that these exploits were being used as external 64-bit executables, which to the CPR researchers indicates that they were bought rather than developed in-house.""If the Raspberry Robin authors were the developers of the exploits, then they would have probably used the exploits in the main component itself,"" said CPR. ""In addition, the exploits would be packed in the same way and have the same format as the different stages of the main component.""The fact that these executables were 64-bit only hints towards outside development, since Raspberry Robin was developed for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.The abuses also didn't use the same high degree of obfuscation techniques as Raspberry Robin's main component does, such as control flow flattening and variable masking.Raspberry Robin plays an important role in the world of cybercrime and is trusted by many of the major criminal groups that are tracked by security researchers, such as EvilCorp, TA505, IcedID, and various ransomware affiliates.Last year it was named as one of the three malware loaders that were jointly responsible for 80 percent of cyberattacks between January and August 2023, alongside QBot and SocGholish.In publishing its suspicions about Raspberry Robin's shift toward buying exploits, CPR also found an array of new features had been added. The malware is well known for its regular updates, especially focused on anti-evasion techniques, and the latest version is no different.It comes loaded with new methods to prevent researchers from analyzing its inner workings as well as new routines for surviving system shutdowns. Minor updates to its communication and lateral movement logic have also made it through the pipeline. ®",emerging threats and attack techniques,marketing,FALSE

Why Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is Growing,"Cybersecurity In-Depth: Feature articles on security strategy, latest trends, and people to know.Why Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingTabletop exercises can be an effective and affordable way to test an organization's defense and response capabilities against cyberattack.February 8, 2024Organizations that are regularly defending against cyberattacks can find it useful to occasionally take a step back and test their defense and response capabilities. One way to do this is through cybersecurity drills, which provide organizations with a snapshot of their ability to handle ransomware, phishing, and other attacks.Cybersecurity drills come in many forms, including penetration testing, phishing simulations, and live-fire exercises, with some scenarios costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and running over several days or even weeks.The least complex of these drills are tabletop exercises, which typically run for two to four hours and can cost less than $50,000 (sometimes much less), with much of the expense related to planning and facilitating the event.Unlike some other drills, tabletop exercises often don't involve attacks on live IT systems. Instead, a facilitator lays out a cyberattack scenario and employees of the client organization discuss the steps they would take in response.This common approach to tabletop exercises is old-school and low-tech, but proponents say a well-run scenario can expose holes in organizations' response and mitigation plans.Tabletop Exercises Are in DemandDemand for tabletop exercises has grown exponentially in the past two years, driven by compliance issues, board directives, and cyber insurance mandates, says Mark Lance, vice president of incident response at GuidePoint Security, a cybersecurity consulting firm.In some cases, employees ask for tabletop exercises to help educate executives. ""People want their senior leadership teams to understand the true impacts of a potential incident,"" Lance says.Many cybersecurity organizations promote tabletop exercises as a way for organizations to test and improve their incident response and internal and external communication plans following a cyberattack. The nonprofit Center for Internet Security calls tabletops ""a must,"" stressing that they help organizations better coordinate separate business units in response to an attack and identify the employees who will play critical roles during and after an attack.There are no cut-and-paste ways to run a tabletop exercise, though the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency provides packages to help organizations get started. Some organizations run tabletops with internal teams, although the more common approach is to hire an outside cybersecurity vendor.How Tabletop Exercises WorkIn a typical tabletop, the facilitator leads a discussion by asking a series of questions. For example, a scenario can start with an employee calling into a help desk after seeing unusual activity on the company's network. Some questions in a tabletop for IT teams might be:What are your next steps?How are you performing that investigation?How are you correlating that activity to other activities in your environment?How is that tracked in an incident ticket?When does the activity reach a certain level of severity?When do you bring in your incident management team?A tabletop for executives might include the following questions:An incident has been reported — when are we bringing in external counsel?When are we using our cyber insurance policy?When should internal and external notifications go out?Who is drafting the notifications?Tabletops can start with hundreds of different scenarios, including widespread problems like ransomware and phishing attacks. However, individual tabletops need to focus specifically on the organization or its industry to be successful, Lance says, adding that the success or failure of a tabletop depends largely on the provider's ability to plan the exercise and target it to the specific client.""The more specific it is to their environment, the more inclined they are to stay engaged and interested, because there's a level of authenticity and validity to it,"" he says.GuidePoint, for example, taps its own threat intelligence team to come up with real-world scenarios that are realistic to the client and are recent or emerging threats.Another way to ensure success is by running separate tabletop exercises for an organization's senior leadership and technical teams. Lance says these two groups benefit from different scenarios. Executives often want to talk about companywide issues and high-level decisions that need to be made. In contrast, technical people want to get into the nitty-gritty of stopping and mitigating an attack.""If you do a technical tabletop, your technical resources might not open up the same way if you have senior leadership sitting in with them,"" Lance says. ""In the other direction, senior leadership may not want to seem nontechnical or stupid in front of their technical resources, so they might not open up as much. [With both groups involved], you have too loud of a voice in the room.""Learning Through Realistic ScenariosIn addition to failing to provide a realistic scenario, facilitators of tabletop exercises also can falter by failing to keep a group engaged or by being more of an observer than a leader, says Curtis Fechner, cyber practice leader and engineering fellow at cybersecurity consulting and integration provider Optiv. Participant engagement is the biggest factor in a tabletop's success, he adds.""If I'm very passive,"" Fechner says, ""if I'm not prompting questions or challenging their responses and just passively letting them talk, or if you get a group of people [complaining] among themselves about a problem, that kills the exercise, the momentum, and the energy.""However, if you've planned for a relevant scenario and kept the participants engaged, it's difficult for a tabletop exercise to fail, he says. A well-facilitated discussion will result in participants learning about their organization's incident response plans and identifying areas that could be improved.Most cybersecurity exercises contain a learning curve for everyone involved, says Peter Manev, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Stamus Networks, a network detection and response provider. In December, Stamus Networks participated in a live-fire exercise called Crossed Swords, organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence (CCDCOE).The best outcomes to tabletop exercises are when ""the teams are clicking together, learning together, exchanging information and experiences, and, of course, making progress,"" Manev says. ""In my view, if that happens, you've already accomplished something.""At the end of an exercise, Fechner likes to take a half hour to discuss the lessons learned throughout. He asks participants what they think they did well and where the pain points were.""That, to me, is a successful tabletop right there — when you get those people to actually do that sort of self-analysis and come out with that introspection,"" he says. ""When problems get called out, that, to me, defines a successful tabletop exercise.""As they assess their exercise, participants should be focused on continuous improvement of cybersecurity practices, Fechner adds. ""The nice thing with a tabletop is it's a no-failure sort of event,"" he says. ""Realistically, it's all about exposing these opportunities to grow and improve.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Why Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingFeb 8, 2024|5 Min ReadAs Smart Cities Expand, So Do the ThreatsFeb 6, 2024|5 Min ReadName That Edge Toon: The Great EscapeFeb 5, 2024|1 Min ReadA Cyber Insurer's Perspective on How to Avoid RansomwareJan 29, 2024|5 Min Read",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE
Stealthy Zardoor Backdoor Targets Saudi Islamic Charity Organization,"An unnamed Islamic non-profit organization in Saudi Arabia has been targeted as part of a stealthy cyber espionage campaign designed to drop a previously undocumented backdoor called Zardoor.Cisco Talos, which discovered the activity in May 2023, said the campaign has likely persisted since at least March 2021, adding it has identified only one compromised target to date, although it's suspected that there could be other victims.""Throughout the campaign, the adversary used living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins) to deploy backdoors, establish command-and-control (C2), and maintain persistence,"" security researchers Jungsoo An, Wayne Lee, and Vanja Svajcer said, calling out the threat actor's ability to maintain long-term access to victim environments without attracting attention.The intrusion targeting the Islamic charitable organization involved the periodic exfiltration of data roughly twice a month. The exact initial access vector used to infiltrate the entity is currently unknown.The foothold obtained, however, has been leveraged to drop Zardoor for persistence, followed by establishing C2 connections using open-source reverse proxy tools such as Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP), sSocks, and Venom.""Once a connection was established, the threat actor used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to move laterally and spread the attacker's tools — including Zardoor — by spawning processes on the target system and executing commands received from the C2,"" the researchers said.The as-yet-undetermined infection pathway paves the way for a dropper component that, in turn, deploys a malicious dynamic-link library (""oci.dll"") that's responsible for delivering two backdoor modules, ""zar32.dll"" and ""zor32.dll.""While the former is the core backdoor element that facilitates C2 communications, the latter ensures that ""zar32.dll"" has been deployed with administrator privileges. Zardoor is capable of exfiltrating data, executing remotely fetched executables and shellcode, updating the C2 IP address, and deleting itself from the host.The origins of the threat actor behind the campaign are unclear, and it does not share any tactical overlaps with a known, publicly reported threat actor at this time. That said, it's assessed to be the work of an ""advanced threat actor.""",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
China Caught Dropping RAT Designed for FortiGate Devices,"Dutch military intelligence warns that new malware, called ""Coathanger,"" was found in multiple FortiGate devices during an incident response, and that Chinese-state actors are using the persistent RAT for espionage.February 8, 2024The Netherlands' Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) is warning that it has uncovered a new malware strain, persistent and difficult to detect, being deployed by the Chinese government against an existing FortiGate flaw, and that it's part of a wider political espionage campaign.The new remote access Trojan (RAT), called ""Coathanger,"" was used to spy on the Dutch Ministry and Defense (MOD) in 2023, according to a new advisory. During the response to the intrusion, Dutch intelligence service officials discovered the malware was being delivered through a known FortiGate flaw (CVE-2022-42475).Fortinet's FortiGate devices provide network firewall protections.The report stresses that Coathanger doesn't take advantage of a new zero-day exploit and is deployed as second-stage malware. However, the advisory added, ""Coathanger could be used along with an any future FortiGate device vulnerability.""Dutch officials explained, ""The Coathanger malware is stealthy and persistent. It hides itself by hooking system calls that could reveal its presence. It survives reboots and firmware upgrades.""Edge Devices in Cyberattack CrosshairsThe Coathanger malware is part of a wider campaign being waged by Chinese state-sponsored threat actors against Internet-facing edge devices including firewalls, VPN servers, and email servers, according to Dutch authorities.""Chinese threat actors are known to perform wide and opportunistic scanning campaigns for both published (nday) as well as unpublished (0-day) software vulnerabilities on internet-facing (edge) devices,"" the advisory cautioned. ""They do so with a high operational tempo, sometimes abusing vulnerabilities on the day they are published.""Fortinet devices are a popular cyberattack target, so businesses should stay on top of patches: Just this week, Fortinet reported two max-severity bugs in its FortiSIEM solution required immediate patching.Recommendations from intelligence analysts in the Netherlands to keep Coathanger at bay also include performing a regular risk analysis on edge devices, limiting Internet access on edge devices, scheduled logging analysis, and replacing any hardware no longer supported.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
"'Coyote' Malware Begins Its Hunt, Preying on 61 Banking Apps","Brazil, the world's center for banking Trojan malware, has produced one of its most advanced tools yet. And as history shows, Coyote may soon expand its territory.February 8, 2024Researchers have discovered a novel banking Trojan they dubbed ""Coyote,"" which is hunting for credentials for 61 different online banking applications.""Coyote,"" detailed by Kaspersky in an analysis today, is notable both for its broad targeting of banking-sector apps (the majority, for now, in Brazil), and its sophisticated interweaving of different rudimentary and advanced components: a relatively new open source installer called Squirrel; NodeJs; an unsung programming language called ""Nim""; and more than a dozen malicious functionalities. In all, it represents a notable evolution in Brazil's thriving market for financial malware — and could spell big trouble down the line for security teams if it expands its focus.""They've been developing banking Trojans for more than 20 years — they started in the year 2000,"" Fabio Assolini, head of the Latin American Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky, says of Brazilian malware developers. ""In 24 years of developing and bypassing new authentication methods and new protection technologies, they've been very creative, and you can see it now with this very new Trojan.""It may be a Brazil-focused threat to consumers for now, but as mentioned, there are clear reasons for organizations to be aware of Coyote. For one, as Assolini warns, ""the malware families that had success in tackling the Brazil market in the past have also expanded abroad. That's why corporations and banks must be prepared to deal with it.""And another reason for security teams to pay attention to the emergence of new banking Trojans is their history of evolving into fully fledged initialaccess Trojans and backdoors; this was the case with Emotet and Trickbot, for instance, and more recently, QakBot and Ursinif.Coyote has functionality in the wings to follow suit: It can execute a range of commands, including directives to take screenshots, log keystrokes, kill processes, shut down the machine, and move its cursor. It can also outright freeze the machine with a fake ""Working on updates …"" overlay.The Coyote Trojan Runs With Squirrel & NimSo far in its attacks, Coyote behaves like any other modern banking Trojan: When a compatible app is triggered on an infected machine, the malware pings an attacker-controlled command-and-control (C2) server displays an appropriate phishing overlay on the victim's screen in order to capture a user's login information. Coyote stands out most, though, for how it combats potential detections.Most banking Trojans utilize Windows Installers (MSI), Kaspersky noted in its blog post, making them an easy red flag for cybersecurity defenders. That's why Coyote opts for Squirrel, a legitimate open source tool for installing and updating Windows desktop apps. Using Squirrel, Coyote attempts to mask its malicious initial stage loader as a perfectly honest update packager.>Its final stage loader is even more unique, as it's written in a relatively niche programming language called ""Nim."" This is the very first banking Trojan Kaspersky has identified using Nim.""Most of the old banking Trojans were written in Delphi, which is quite old and utilized across a lot of families. So over the years, the detection of Delphi malware got very good, and the efficiency of infections was slowing down over the years,"" Assolini explains. With Nim, ""they have a more modern language to program with new features and a low rate of detection by security software.""Brazilian Banking Trojans Are a Global ProblemIf Coyote has to do so much to distinguish itself, it's because the world's fifth-largest nation has in recent years become the world's premier hub for banking malware.And for as much as they terrorize Brazilians, these programs also have a habit of crossing bodies of water.""These guys are very experienced in developing banking Trojans, and they're eager to expand their attacks worldwide,"" Assolini emphasizes. ""Right now, we can find Brazilian bank Trojans attacking companies and people as far away as Australia and Europe. This week, a member of my team found a new version of one in Italy.""To demonstrate the potential future for a tool like Coyote, Assolini points to Grandoreiro, a similar Trojan that made serious inroads into Mexico and Spain but also well beyond. By the end of last fall, he says, it had reached a total of 41 countries.A byproduct of that success, however, was increased scrutiny from law enforcement. In a step toward disrupting its free-flowing cyber underground for this kind of malware, Brazilian police made a rare move: They executed five temporary arrest warrants and 13 search and seizure warrants, for the architects behind Grandoreiro across five Brazilian states.""The problem in Brazil is they don't have very good local law enforcement for punishing these attackers. It works better when you have an entity outside of the country applying some pressure, as happened with Granadoreiro, when the police and banks in Spain were pressuring Brazilian federal police to catch these guys,"" Assolini says.So, he concludes, ""they're getting better, but there's a long way to go, because a lot of cybercriminals are still free [in Brazil] and committing lots of attacks worldwide.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
New Webinar: 5 Steps to vCISO Success for MSPs and MSSPs,"2024 will be the year of the vCISO. An incredible 45% of MSPs and MSSPs are planning to start offering vCISO services in 2024. As an MSP/MSSP providing vCISO services, you own the organization's cybersecurity infrastructure and strategy. But you also need to position yourself as a reliable decision-maker, navigating professional responsibilities, business needs and leadership requirements. A new webinar by Cynomi, vCISO platform leader, hosting CISO and vCISO veteran Jesse Miller from PowerPSA Consulting, provides MSPs and MSSPs with an effective 100-day plan to build themselves up for success.The webinar provides a tangible five-step 100-day action plan that any MSP/MSSP can follow when they engage with a new vCISO client. It also provides guidance on vCISO goals and pitfalls to avoid. By watching the webinar, you can position yourself as a strategic and long-term partner for your clients. They will see you as capable of driving security transformation and managing security continuously and dynamically.Some of the main highlights covered in the webinar:vCISO GoalsWhen starting as a vCISO, it's important to understand the vCISO's goals and use them to guide you throughout your role:- Establishing, overseeing and managing organizational security in a flexible and robust manner.- Fostering trust with security goals through alignment, to get leadership and stakeholder buy-in.- Making security a business enabler, contributing to compliance, operational efficiency, a competitive advantage, financial responsibility, and more.Pitfalls to AvoidAt the same time, stay clear of pitfalls that can disrupt your ability to provide high-quality services. Some tips for avoiding pitfalls include:- Stay strategic and resist the temptation to put out fires.- Maintain objectivity and avoid getting caught up in organizational politics.- Use automation, not manual processes. Those are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient compared.- Ensure compliance to avoid grave legal and reputational consequences.- Delegate and build the infrastructure rather than doing everything yourself.- And moreThe 5 Phases: Your 100 Day Action PlanPhase 1: Research (Days 0-30)Welcome to your new client! Start by researching the current state of the organization's security posture and business objectives. This involves building relationships with stakeholders and the IT/security team, reviewing management practices, policies and configurations, and assessing vendor management processes and third-party risks. These actions will help you understand the potential vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of existing security controls and procedures.Phase 2 Understand (Days 0-45)Now, it's time to bring your findings together. This starts with conducting a security risk assessment with a standard onboarding questionnaire and scanning tool. Then, use all the information from the assessment and from phase one to create a clear picture of security maturity and the security posture. After presenting this posture and existing gaps to management, you will be able to develop a list of short-term and long-term needs based on risks and business objectives. In the list, make sure to demonstrate the business value of your security investments. When possible, use automation for efficiency.Phase 3: Prioritize (Days 15-60)The third step is about shaping actionable plans.Draft short, mid and long-term goals and develop the plan and required budget to achieve these goals. Identify 2-3 quick wins that will improve security and your organizational stance and share all these deliverables, together with a risk register, with management.Phase 4: Execute (Days 30-80)Now is the time to execute. This will establish your vCISO credibility and set the tone for ongoing security management. Once you have stakeholder and management buy-in, communicate your plan across the board, creating a sense of shared responsibility and success. Start executing the tasks that will help you achieve your goals: implementing automated systems, the quick wins you identified, high-priority policy creation, and new tools and products. As soon as possible, set up the reporting cadence to help you demonstrate improvement. And as always, in a fast-moving environment, be prepared to adjust as needed.Phase 5 - Report (Days 45-100)Reporting is key for demonstrating success. Collect data that reflects progress and success, like reduced incident response times or fewer successful phishing attempts. Make sure to communicate this data to management in a way that shows the business impact, successes and challenges, and security progress. On top of this frequent reporting, conduct an additional full assessment after 3-4 months to demonstrate progress and identify any new or unresolved vulnerabilities. Based on these reports, continuously adapt and improve your processes and controls to keep security measures effective and relevant.Your Next Steps as a vCISOMaking meaningful choices, measuring your impact, and maintaining a flexible mindset will set you up for success on your vCISO journey. To get more insights, understand how this plan comes together and to get a complete list of tasks and a checklist to guide you throughout your first 100 days, watch the webinar here.",news and industry updates,vulnerability reports,FALSE

IoT/OT Network Adversaries Advance Amidst Bug Barrage,"February 8, 2024New telemetry data from Internet of Things and operational technology networks brings into sharp focus the risks associated with IoT and OT installations: These networks are subject to highly sophisticated attacks, while in tandem, the volume of vulnerabilities associated with each explodes. And consequently, IoT and OT networks pose even greater risks than generally acknowledged.Data from the last half of 2023 analyzed by Nozomi Networks showed the largest portion of threats to IoT and OT networks were network anomalies and attacks, with sophisticated tactics like TCP flood and network scans being most popular, the company said in a new report.""These trends should serve as a warning that attackers are adopting more sophisticated methods to directly target critical infrastructure, and could be indicative of rising global hostilities,"" Chris Grove, director of cybersecurity strategy at Nozomi Networks, said in a statement about the new data. ""The significant uptick in anomalies could mean that the threat actors are getting past the first line of defense while penetrating deeper than many would have initially believed, which would require a high level of sophistication.""Meanwhile, tried-and-true IoT and OT cyberattack approaches like access control and authorization threats, including brute force and multiple login attacks, were up too — by 123%.A bit of good news: There was a 12% dip in daily cyberattacks against IoT devices during the last half of 2023.Vulnerabilities Add to IoT/OT ThreatPiling additional cyber-risk onto IoT and OT network defenders was the mounting number of vulnerabilities affecting industrial control systems (ICS) identified by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which rose 38% over the previous six months, the Nozomi Networks analysis added. Manufacturing vulnerabilities dominated the CISA list, with a 230% increase in discoveries over the previous half-year.Similarly, the number of vendors impacted by CISA-reported ICS bugs was up by 19%.Grove tells Dark Reading that it's unrealistic to think any network can be 100% secure.""That's why it's important to focus not only on security defenses but also adopt a post-breach mentality,"" Grove adds. ""To minimize risk and maximize operational resiliency, prioritize strategies that include network segmentation, asset discovery, vulnerability management, patching, logging, endpoint detection, and threat intelligence.""Actionable asset and threat intelligence should also be part of the cyber defense mix, Grove says.""In an increasingly complex threat landscape, resiliency will be the key to effective defenses,"" he adds.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Google Starts Blocking Sideloading of Potentially Dangerous Android Apps in Singapore,"Google has unveiled a new pilot program in Singapore that aims to prevent users from sideloading certain apps that abuse Android app permissions to read one-time passwords and gather sensitive data.""This enhanced fraud protection will analyze and automatically block the installation of apps that may use sensitive runtime permissions frequently abused for financial fraud when the user attempts to install the app from an Internet-sideloading source (web browsers, messaging apps or file managers),"" the company said.The feature is designed to examine the permissions declared by a third-party app in real-time and look for those that seek to gain access to sensitive permissions associated with reading SMS messages, deciphering or dismissing notifications from legitimate apps, and accessibility services that have been routinely abused by Android-based malware for extracting valuable information.As part of the test, users in Singapore who attempt to sideload such apps (or APK files) will be blocked from doing so via Google Play Protect and displayed a pop-up message that reads: ""This app can request access to sensitive data. This can increase the risk of identity theft or financial fraud.""""These permissions are frequently abused by fraudsters to intercept one-time passwords via SMS or notifications, as well as spy on-screen content,"" Eugene Liderman, director of the mobile security strategy at Google, said.The change is part of a collaborative effort to combat mobile fraud, the tech giant said, urging app developers to follow best practices and review their apps' device permissions to ensure it does not violate the Mobile Unwanted Software principles.Google, which launched Google Play Protect real-time scanning at the code level to detect novel Android malware in select markets like India, Thailand, Singapore, and Brazil, said the effort allowed it to detect 515,000 new malicious apps and that it issued no less than 3.1 million warnings or blocks of those apps.The development also comes as Apple announced sweeping changes to the App Store in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) ahead of the March 6, 2024, deadline. The changes, including Notarization for iOS apps, are expected to go live with iOS 17.4.The iPhone maker, however, repeatedly emphasized that distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces exposes E.U. users to ""increased privacy and security threats,"" and that it does not intend to bring them to other regions.""This includes new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats,"" Apple said.

Chinese Hackers Operate Undetected in U.S. Critical Infrastructure for Half a Decade,"The U.S. government on Wednesday said the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as Volt Typhoon had been embedded into some critical infrastructure networks in the country for at least five years.Targets of the threat actor include communications, energy, transportation, and water and wastewater systems sectors in the U.S. and Guam.""Volt Typhoon's choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions,"" the U.S. government said.The idea is to pre-position themselves on IT networks by maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time for disruptive or destructive cyber attacks against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the country.The joint advisory, which was released by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was also backed by other nations that are part of the Five Eyes (FVEY) intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K.Volt Typhoon – which is also called Bronze Silhouette, Insidious Taurus, UNC3236, Vanguard Panda, or Voltzite – is a stealthy China-based cyber espionage group that's believed to be active since June 2021.It first came to light in May 2023 when FVEY and Microsoft revealed that the hacking crew managed to establish a persistent foothold into critical infrastructure organizations in the U.S. and Guam for extended periods of time sans getting detected by principally leveraging living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques.""This kind of tradecraft, known as 'living off the land,' allows attackers to operate discreetly, with malicious activity blending in with legitimate system and network behavior making it difficult to differentiate – even by organizations with more mature security postures,"" the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said.Another hallmark tactic adopted by Volt Typhoon is the use of multi-hop proxies like KV-botnet to route malicious traffic through a network of compromised routers and firewalls in the U.S. to mask its true origins.Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, in a report published in June 2023, called out its reliance on an extensive arsenal of open-source tooling against a narrow set of victims to achieve its strategic goals.""Volt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre-exploitation reconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment; tailor their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the victim's environment; and dedicate ongoing resources to maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time, even after initial compromise,"" the agencies noted.""The group also relies on valid accounts and leverages strong operational security, which combined, allows for long-term undiscovered persistence.""Furthermore, the nation-state has been observed attempting to obtain administrator credentials within the network by exploiting privilege escalation flaws, subsequently leveraging the elevated access to facilitate lateral movement, reconnaissance, and full domain compromise.The ultimate goal of the campaign is to retain access to the compromised environments, ""methodically"" re-targeting them over years to validate and expand their unauthorized accesses. This meticulous approach, per the agencies, is evidenced in cases where they have repeatedly exfiltrated domain credentials to ensure access to current and valid accounts.""In addition to leveraging stolen account credentials, the actors use LOTL techniques and avoid leaving malware artifacts on systems that would cause alerts,"" CISA, FBI, and NSA said.""Their strong focus on stealth and operational security allows them to maintain long-term, undiscovered persistence. Further, Volt Typhoon's operational security is enhanced by targeted log deletion to conceal their actions within the compromised environment.""The development comes as the Citizen Lab revealed a network of at least 123 websites impersonating local news outlets spanning 30 countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America that's pushing pro-China content in a widespread influence campaign linked to a Beijing public relations firm named Shenzhen Haimaiyunxiang Media Co., Ltd.The Toronto-based digital watchdog, which dubbed the influence operation PAPERWALL, said it shares similarities with HaiEnergy, albeit with different operators and unique TTPs.""A central feature of PAPERWALL, observed across the network of websites, is the ephemeral nature of its most aggressive components, whereby articles attacking Beijing's critics are routinely removed from these websites some time after they are published,"" the Citizen Lab said.In a statement shared with Reuters, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington said ""it is a typical bias and double standard to allege that the pro-China contents and reports are 'disinformation,' and to call the anti-China ones 'true information.'""",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Super Bowl LVIII Presents a Vast Attack Surface for Threat Actors,"February 8, 2024The outcome of this year's Super Bowl matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers on Feb. 11 at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas will likely remain unknown until the last down of the game. But one thing that is already abundantly clear is that attackers will have no shortage of targets to blitz at the event.The NFL's continuing digitization of almost all aspects of the event, from ticketing to gate access systems and virtually every other point of contact with fans, has opened new vulnerabilities and targets that its security team has had to secure. Concerns include threats to arena security, ransomware attacks on critical systems, phishing and credential theft, and threats to personal data and other sensitive information belonging to fans, NFL employees, players, and coaches.Preparing for the Big (Security) GameIn a conversation with Dark Reading at the beginning of the 2023/2024 season, NFL CISO Tomás Maldonado had identified AI-enabled phishing attacks and deepfake audio and video scams as adding to the slew of other existing security challenges the league has had to contend with in general.The NFL itself has been preparing for some time to identify and assess threats to the Super Bowl—easily the most watched TV event each year—and to implement plans for dealing with them. Last September, league officials in coordination with 100 other stakeholders, including the US Department of Homeland Security and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), conducted a tabletop exercise where they ran through a series of attack scenarios that together had a cascading impact on physical systems supporting the event.That exercise was part of an ongoing effort between the NFL and the other participants to prepare for whatever security challenge might surface at the game. Stakeholders added that the preparation will be especially key considering the heightened geopolitical tensions around events in the Middle East.The Security Implications of Sporting Event DigitizationKarl Mattson, field CISO at Noname Security, views API-related security issues as likely a big focus for attackers this year, given the NFL's extensive digital transformation in recent years.""API threats surrounding the Super Bowl come in three areas: the fan digital experience, advertising, and event infrastructure,"" Mattson says.The most likely scenario, if an API-related attack were to happen, is a large-scale compromise of NFL fan personal information stolen, which may include authentication or biometric information, he notes. The digital fan experience of purchasing tickets, merchandise shopping, online betting, and other interactions all utilize services enabled by APIs. ""Each aspect of a fan consuming the NFL's product involves the exchange of personal or payment information which can be exploited by an attacker who discovers a poorly controlled API,"" he says.The same is true for advertisers who air commercials during the event, and set up a new website or service to field consumer response. Without first battle-testing them for a flood of visitors or DDoS efforts, the effort can fumble. Mattson points to the memorable 2022 Super Bowl ad by Coinbase that included only a bouncing QR code, which pointed viewers to a promotion website the company had set up for the ad. The website ended up crashing shortly after the ad aired because of the sheer volume of visitors.Physical event-specific and public infrastructure to support the Super Bowl are also enabled by API-first technologies. The stadium's 5G network, local security and emergency services, and public utility systems all use API-based services for routine operations that attackers could potentially seek to disrupt, Mattson says.Online Gambling: A Breeding Ground for New ScamsThe rise of online gambling and sports betting opens up a new gridiron for cyberattackers. The phenomenon has created a breeding ground for new and evolving scams targeting events like the Super Bowl, says Stuart Wells, CTO at Jumio.""A plethora of betting apps and websites are readily available at our fingertips, attracting a wider audience, including younger demographics more accustomed to digital interactions,"" Wells says. This accessibility, unfortunately, coincides with a rise in synthetic identity fraud, where criminals create fake identities using a false name and bits and pieces of stolen identity information — such as a real birth date and Social Security numbers.""Synthetic identity fraud, in particular, can be tricky for gaming operators as it makes malicious actors extremely difficult to trace,"" Wells notes. ""If an attacker can bypass defenses and operate under a synthetic identity, they may be able to operate undetected, meaning that operators might not catch a fraudster until a player's account has been manipulated or some kind of fraud has been committed.""Exacerbating the situation is the relative lack of privacy protections in many of the betting apps that people use to make wagers during events like the Super Bowl. A new study by data privacy company Incogni examined seven of the most popular betting apps; most of them are collecting and sharing private data extensively without proper disclosure.The biggest data hog was DraftKings, which Incogni found was gathering 22 data points from users, including their precise location, contacts, messages, photos, and videos. Betting apps from Caesars, Sky Bet, and William Hill were relatively close behind, gathering 17 data points each, including precise location, in-app search history, health information, and purchase histories. Meanwhile, Caesars led the rest when it came to sharing the data it collects from user devices with third parties.Super Bowl fans should also expect a surge of fake tickets and counterfeit merchandise in online marketplaces, tempting fans with jerseys, hats, and memorabilia that look real but are cheaply made and lack official logos, Well says.""All of these scams are likely to make their way to consumers via phishing emails and texts. Consumers should proceed with caution and verify who they are doing business with before handing over any personal information or payment,"" he warns.Business Risk From Unauthorized Streaming SitesKen Carnesi, CEO of DNSFilter, points to unauthorized streaming sites as a risk for organizations that let employees use unmanaged devices for work-related purposes. Data that the company gathered from its network over the last month showed a sharp increase in blocked sites with ""NFL"" in the domain name, he says.""Traffic increased on our network during the playoffs, peaking on Jan. 28, the same day as the AFC and NFC championship game,"" Carnesi says. ""Overall, from Jan. 5 to the peak on Jan. 28, it was a 125% increase in security-blocked traffic.""Risks to organizations that permit work-related devices for personal use without any controls include a heightened likelihood of malware infections and phishing attacks.""Additionally, these streaming activities can create network vulnerabilities, with insecure channels and peer-to-peer connections posing risks to the organization's data integrity,"" Carnesi says. ""Data exfiltration is also an increased possibility, potentially exposing sensitive company information from illicit sites collecting and misusing user data.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
India to make its digital currency programmable,"Reserve Bank also wants a national 2FA frameworkThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced on Thursday it would make its digital currency programmable, and ensure it can be exchanged when citizens are offline.The country's current CBDC retail pilot launched in late 2022. It already enables both person-to-person and person-to-merchant transactions. Apparently, that's going well enough for RBI to add more functions.""It is now proposed to enable additional functionalities of programmability and offline capability in CBDC retail payments,"" stated RBI in its latest monthly governor's statement. ""Programmability will facilitate transactions for specific/targeted purposes, while offline functionality will enable these transactions in areas with poor or limited internet connectivity.""India has plenty of those – both in remote locations and in its mountainous regions where it's hard to create pervasive mobile networks.The new functions are to be introduced gradually through more pilot programs.Indian media report that governor Shaktikanta Das outlined scenarios for the programmable digital rupee, including allowing government agencies to ensure payments to citizens are only used for defined benefits. Businesses, he added, could ""program specified expenditures like business travel for their employees."" Das even envisaged digital cash being tied to geographical areas.- Programmable or 'purpose-bound' money is coming, probably as a feature in central bank digital currencies- Florida man slams 'tyranny' of central bank digital currencies in re-election bid- Use AI to accelerate adoption of central bank digital currencies, says IMF head- Britcoin or Britcon? Bank of England grilled on Digital Pound privacy concernsRBI's e-rupee plans extend beyond making programmable and offline CBDCs. It plans to put in place a principle-based framework for authentication of digital payment transactions. It has already tested additional factor authentication – including SMS-based OTP – but would like some more options.In the governor's message, RBI chief general manager Yogesh Dayal framed these initiatives as an economic development accelerator.""At the current juncture, India's potential growth is propelled by structural drivers like improving physical infrastructure; development of world class digital and payments technology; ease of doing business; enhanced labour force participation; and improved quality of fiscal spending,"" asserted Dayal.Another way India is looking to build its digital economy is by allowing itself to tax more of it. Bloomberg reported the nation will call for the end of a 1998 agreement not to tax digital goods. If India succeeds, tariffs could be allowed on a wide range of items – from software downloads to video games.India has argued that the current international agreements cause loss of tariff revenue and affect its trade competitiveness. ®",emerging threats and attack techniques,vulnerability reports,FALSE

How Hospitals Can Help Improve Medical Device Data Security,"February 8, 2024COMMENTARYHospitals and medical device manufacturers must team up to help create a secure environment to protect the personal health information derived from patient monitors and other medical devices.For some time, this notion of shared responsibility for data security has been recognized as a best practice within the larger technology industry. For example, many cloud service providers follow this model to define the mutual security obligations of the cloud providers and their customers.Within healthcare, a similar model has emerged, with medical researchers, developers, and regulatory bodies agreeing that cybersecurity is, in fact, a shared responsibility. This means medical device manufacturers, hospital software providers, and health organizations must collaborate to shield patient information and medical device systems against cybercriminal activity.Understanding Roles in Medical Device Data SecurityThe US FDA requires medical device manufacturers and software providers to follow a process called security by design, which maintains that certain controls must be embedded in a product to make it easier for hospitals to deploy and use them securely.Features such as configurable encryption, secure login pages, and user authentication requirements are examples of how manufacturers integrate security capabilities into their products. These security features in the product's design often require hospitals to take action to activate them and maintain their viability.Consider the example of product access control. Typically, a device manufacturer or software provider can implement access controls in product functionalities by verifying or authenticating the identity of a clinical user. Looking at a hospital's Active Directory service and utilizing necessary passwords and protocols can determine if the user belongs to a group the product recognizes through its configuration.Only the healthcare organization can identify which users are authorized to access the system and configure the product appropriately. Using an inappropriate group, allowing too many users, or being lax about maintaining an up-to-date directory can open a network to unnecessary risk.Even mobile and cloud-based applications require shared responsibility. Hospitals must ensure that browsers and mobile devices are up to date with security features enabled to optimize the manufacturer's cloud-based security controls, such as multifactor authentication.Therefore, to facilitate secure product implementation, medical equipment manufacturers must embed security controls using proven algorithms and designs guided by the security-by-design process. At the same time, hospitals have their own share of responsibilities and activities to ensure the product is used securely.With different products available throughout their facilities, it can be difficult for IT leaders to know how to proceed. For security measures to be successful, hospitals and manufacturers must collaborate to determine what will best meet the hospital's needs. Every hospital has processes and procedures to secure its IT infrastructure, which extend to all products within a system.Before a hospital deploys a device, its manufacturer must be transparent about the security features that the hospital can use, as well as their expectations of the hospital environment. Hospitals, in turn, should educate themselves about those security features and determine if they meet their expectations.How Do Hospitals Know Their Role?Manufacturers usually make it easy for hospitals to understand how to optimize medical data security. They often provide clinical users and system administrators with information and guidelines such as the Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2), software bills of materials (SBOMs), hardening guides, and other security guidance materials.These documents provide step-by-step blueprints for healthcare providers to follow to do their part to protect medical device data from intrusion. Recommended steps may include restricting login access to specific personnel, securing connections between systems using network segmentation and restricted ports, using trusted certificates to verify the identity of medical devices and clinical data receiving systems, and other actions specific to the hospital's network.Read Manufacturers' Recommended Security GuidelinesManufacturers' product documentation and guides tell hospitals how to leverage a medical device or software's embedded security features for optimal use. It's important to review these guides every time a new version of a product or software is deployed because enhanced security controls may require additional measures, such as updated encryption configurations or new private keys.It's also not uncommon for some security controls, such as systems access needs or password requirements, to degrade over time as clinical users make configuration or access changes. Use these guides regularly to control the effectiveness of the current security configuration.Cybercriminals only need one weak spot to infiltrate a network for nefarious purposes. To thwart their activity, manufacturers and hospitals need to team up and be clear about each other's roles and shared responsibilities in an end-to-end secure data environment.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Global Coalition and Tech Giants Unite Against Commercial Spyware Abuse,"A coalition of dozens of countries, including France, the U.K., and the U.S., along with tech companies such as Google, MDSec, Meta, and Microsoft, have signed a joint agreement to curb the abuse of commercial spyware to commit human rights abuses.The initiative, dubbed the Pall Mall Process, aims to tackle the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber intrusion tools by establishing guiding principles and policy options for States, industry, and civil society in relation to the development, facilitation, purchase, and use of such tools.The declaration stated that ""uncontrolled dissemination"" of spyware offerings contributes to ""unintentional escalation in cyberspace,"" noting it poses risks to cyber stability, human rights, national security, and digital security.""Where these tools are used maliciously, attacks can access victims' devices, listen to calls, obtain photos and remotely operate a camera and microphone via 'zero-click' spyware, meaning no user interaction is needed,"" the U.K. government said in a press release.According to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), thousands of individuals are estimated to have been globally targeted by spyware campaigns every year.""And as the commercial market for these tools grows, so too will the number and severity of cyber attacks compromising our devices and our digital systems, causing increasingly expensive damage and making it more challenging than ever for our cyber defenses to protect public institutions and services,"" Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said at the U.K.-France Cyber Proliferation conference.Notably missing from the list of countries that participated in the event is Israel, which is home to a number of private sector offensive actors (PSOAs) or commercial surveillance vendors (CSVs) such as Candiru, Intellexa (Cytrox), NSO Group, and QuaDream.Recorded Future News reported that Hungary, Mexico, Spain, and Thailand – which have been linked to spyware abuses in the past – did not sign the pledge.The multi-stakeholder action coincides with an announcement by the U.S. Department of State to deny visas for individuals that it deems to be involved with the misuse of dangerous spyware technology.""Until recently, a lack of accountability has enabled the spyware industry to proliferate dangerous surveillance tools around the world,"" Google said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. ""Limiting spyware vendors' ability to operate in the U.S. helps to change the incentive structure which has allowed their continued growth.""One hand, spyware such as Chrysaor and Pegasus are licensed to government customers for use in law enforcement and counterterrorism. On the other hand, they have also been routinely abused by oppressive regimes to target journalists, activists, lawyers, human rights defenders, dissidents, political opponents, and other civil society members.Such intrusions typically leverage zero-click (or one-click) exploits to surreptitiously deliver the surveillanceware onto the targets' Google Android and Apple iOS devices with the goal of harvesting sensitive information.That having said, ongoing efforts to combat and contain the spyware ecosystem have been something of a whack-a-mole, underscoring the challenge of fending off recurring and lesser-known players who provide or come up with similar cyber weapons.This also extends to the fact that CSVs continue to expend effort developing new exploit chains as companies like Apple, Google, and others discover and plug the zero-day vulnerabilities.|Source: Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG)""As long as there is a demand for surveillance capabilities, there will be incentives for CSVs to continue developing and selling tools, perpetrating an industry that harms high risk users and society at large,"" Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said.An extensive report published by TAG this week revealed that the company is tracking roughly 40 commercial spyware companies that sell their products to government agencies, with 11 of them linked to the exploitation of 74 zero-days in Google Chrome (24), Android (20), iOS (16), Windows (6), Adobe (2), and Mozilla Firefox (1) over the past decade.Unknown state-sponsored actors, for example, exploited three flaws in iOS (CVE-2023-28205, CVE-2023-28206, and CVE-2023-32409) as a zero-day last year to infect victims with spyware developed by Barcelona-based Variston. The flaws were patched by Apple in April and May 2023.The campaign, discovered in March 2023, delivered a link via SMS and targeted iPhones located in Indonesia running iOS versions 16.3.0 and 16.3.1 with an aim to deploy the BridgeHead spyware implant via the Heliconia exploitation framework.

HijackLoader Evolves: Researchers Decode the Latest Evasion Methods,"The threat actors behind a loader malware called HijackLoader have added new techniques for defense evasion, as the malware continues to be increasingly used by other threat actors to deliver additional payloads and tooling.""The malware developer used a standard process hollowing technique coupled with an additional trigger that was activated by the parent process writing to a pipe,"" CrowdStrike researchers Donato Onofri and Emanuele Calvelli said in a Wednesday analysis. ""This new approach has the potential to make defense evasion stealthier.""HijackLoader was first documented by Zscaler ThreatLabz in September 2023 as having been used as a conduit to deliver DanaBot, SystemBC, and RedLine Stealer. It's also known to share a high degree of similarity with another loader known as IDAT Loader.Both the loaders are assessed to be operated by the same cybercrime group. In the intervening months, HijackLoader has been propagated via ClearFake and put to use by TA544 (aka Narwhal Spider, Gold Essex, and Ursnif Gang) to deliver Remcos RAT and SystemBC via phishing messages.""Think of loaders like wolves in sheep's clothing. Their purpose is to sneak in, introduce and execute more sophisticated threats and tools,"" Liviu Arsene, director of threat research and reporting at CrowdStrike, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.""This recent variant of HijackLoader (aka IDAT Loader) steps up its sneaking game by adding and experimenting with new techniques. This is similar to enhancing its disguise, making it stealthier, more complex, and more difficult to analyze. In essence, they're refining their digital camouflage.""The starting point of the multi-stage attack chain is an executable (""streaming_client.exe"") that checks for an active internet connection and proceeds to download a second-stage configuration from a remote server.The executable then loads a legitimate dynamic-link library (DLL) specified in the configuration to activate shellcode responsible for launching the HijackLoader payload via a combination of process doppelgänging and process hollowing techniques that increases the complexity of analysis and the defense evasion capabilities.""The HijackLoader second-stage, position-independent shellcode then performs some evasion activities to bypass user mode hooks using Heaven's Gate and injects subsequent shellcode into cmd.exe,"" the researchers said.""The injection of the third-stage shellcode is accomplished via a variation of process hollowing that results in an injected hollowed mshtml.dll into the newly spawned cmd.exe child process.""Heaven's Gate refers to a stealthy trick that allows malicious software to evade endpoint security products by invoking 64-bit code in 32-bit processes in Windows, effectively bypassing user-mode hooks.One of the key evasion techniques observed in HijackLoader attack sequences is the use of a process injection mechanism called transacted hollowing, which has been previously observed in malware such as the Osiris banking trojan.""Loaders are meant to act as stealth launch platforms for adversaries to introduce and execute more sophisticated malware and tools without burning their assets in the initial stages,"" Arsene said.""Investing in new defense evasion capabilities for HijackLoader (aka IDAT Loader) is potentially an attempt to make it stealthier and fly below the radar of traditional security solutions. The new techniques signal both a deliberate and experimental evolution of the existing defense evasion capabilities while also increasing the complexity of analysis for threat researchers.""",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
No one's happy with latest US cyber incident reporting plan,"IT suppliers hacked off with Uncle Sam's demands in aftermath of cyberattacksPlan says to hand over keys to networks – and report intrusions within eight hours of discoveryOrganizations that sell IT services to Uncle Sam are peeved at proposed changes to procurement rules that would require them to allow US government agencies full access to their systems in the event of a security incident.The rules were unveiled in a draft update to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that refreshes security reporting standards for government contractors in line with President Biden's 2021 executive order on the topic.Among the potential incoming requirements are:- Contractors would have just eight hours to report a detected incident to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which would have to be updated every 72 hours thereafter;- A software bill of materials (SBOM) would need to be maintained;- After an incident, contractors would provide ""full access"" to IT systems and personnel for CISA and federal law enforcement agencies.The above ideas – developed by Department of Defense (DoD), General Services Administration (GSA), and NASA – have been suggested in light of the many infosec threats facing the USA.""SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange, and the Colonial Pipeline incident are a sobering reminder that US public and private sector entities increasingly face sophisticated malicious cyber activity from both nation-state actors and cyber criminals,"" the update from the three agencies reads.India's absurd infosec reporting rules get just 15 followersREAD MORE""These incidents share commonalities, including insufficient cyber security defenses that leave public and private sector entities more vulnerable to incidents,"" the trio added.

With more than 80 responses, it's clear many stakeholders wanted to have their say – and all the aforementioned provisions were questioned.The Cloud Service Providers Advisory Board, (CSP-AB), which counts multiple major US cloud service firms among its members, described the new rules as ""burdensome … on information technology companies who are already meeting a high security and compliance bar across the federal marketplace.""The CSP-AB took particular umbrage with the FAR update's SBOM requirements, arguing cloud service providers shouldn't be required to submit them since they're so frequently subject to change – sometimes ""up to hundreds of times"" per day.- Future of America's Cyber Safety Review Board hangs in balance amid calls for rethink- Ransomware more efficient than ever, and baddies are still after your logs- India's absurd infosec reporting rules get just 15 followers- Europe moves closer to stricter cybersecurity standards, reporting regsThe Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC), which represents a laundry list of heavy hitters, expressed dissatisfaction over the proposed reporting rules, describing them as adding ""another hue of color to the kaleidoscope of incident reporting regimes"" being passed by the US federal government of late.ITIC said the eight-hour reporting requirement was ""unduly burdensome and inconsistent"" with other reporting rules, adding that the 72-hour update period ""does not reflect the shifting urgency throughout an incident response.""Even bug bounty biz HackerOne weighed in, arguing among other things that the provision requiring access to contractor systems by federal law enforcement in the wake of a security incident ""has the potential to expose data and information from the contractor's non-federal customers.""""Non-federal customers may be reluctant to continue working with federal contractors, potentially forcing federal contractors to choose between selling to non-federal customers or the government,"" HackerOne warned.Reporting rules are myriad and inconsistentThere's room to debate some of the complaints raised by commenters, but one thing's for certain: Uncle Sam's cyber incident reporting rules are growing in number – and each set of regulations is different.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implemented a rule last summer requiring victims to report cyberattacks to it within four days when the incident could have a ""material"" impact on the business or investors. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) followed suit in the fall with its own incident reporting rule, giving non-banking financial organizations 30 days to inform the commission of a successful break-in of their systems.Volt Typhoon not the only Chinese crew lurking in US energy, critical networksREAD MORECISA, meanwhile, plans to follow suit with its own rules outlined by the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), signed into law by President Biden in March 2022, with a two-year deadline to propose a rule. Due next month, CIRCIA will give companies in critical infrastructure sectors three days to report an incident.Congressional representatives have expressed discontent with the SEC's reporting rules and introduced a bill to kill its reporting requirement – citing too short a deadline and the fact that incident reporting should fall under CISA's purview. The proposed FAR updates, as mentioned, give a mere eight hours.All of these various reporting requirements are likely to lead to what the ITIC describes as ""misalignment"" among reporting requirements, with the council calling for ""the establishment of one authoritative incident reporting process across the federal government and regulated sectors.""""Several incident reporting regimes are potentially suitable candidates,"" ITIC EVP of public sector policy Gordon Bitko wrote in the org’s submission, suggesting rules set by CIRCIA and the SEC as suitable alternatives.""The rule should identify one coordinating agency, ideally CISA [which] should be the focal point for all reporting and subsequent investigations,"" Bitko added, echoing calls from other commenters and representative Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), who introduced a House bill to kill the SEC's reporting requirements.We've asked NASA, the GSA, and DoD for comment, and have not received a response at the time of publication. ®",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
"Rust can help make software secure, but it's not a cure-all","Rust can help make software secure – but it's no cure-allSecurity is a process, not a product. Nor a languageMemory-safety flaws represent the majority of high-severity problems for Google and Microsoft, but they're not necessarily associated with the majority of vulnerabilities that actually get exploited.So while coding with Rust can help reduce memory safety vulnerabilities, it won't fix everything.Security biz Horizon3.ai has analyzed CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities in 2023 and found, as chief attack engineer Zach Hanley put it, that ""Rust won’t save us, but it will help us.""We feel this is something that can't be said enough right now; if it's already obvious to you, well done. Rust will stop you using data after it's been freed, or try its best to stop you, but it can't really prevent you introducing logic bugs or passing unfiltered user input to a command interpreter.The most common vulnerabilities in 2023 had to do with insecure exposed functions, representing 48.8 percent of last year's crop. These include flaws like CVE-2023-33246 in Apache RocketMQ, in which the application ""insecurely exposed an endpoint that calls Java'sgetRuntime().exec() with an attacker-controlled variable.""Or CVE-2023-22515 in Atlassian Confluence, in which the application insecurely exposed an endpoint that allowed a server's configuration state to be modified.Memory safety flaws tied for second place alongside web routing and path abuse – categories each representing 19.5 percent of 2023 vulnerabilities.CVE-2023-34362, the Progress MOVEit Transfer vulnerability, is an example of path abuse. In this instance, the application tried to limit access locally but contained a header parsing but that exposed functions.- Simon Willison interview: AI software still needs the human touch- Thousands of Juniper Networks devices vulnerable to critical RCE bug- Memory-safe languages so hot right now, agrees Lazarus Group as it slings DLang malware- Dump C++ and in Rust you should trust, Five Eyes agencies urgeWhile memory safety vulnerabilities may not have been the largest source of problems last year, they tend to have a significant impact because they're often identified at the time they're first actively exploited, before patches have been prepared.Horizon3.ai found that 75 percent of the memory safety bugs analyzed were exploited as zero-day flaws and that 25 percent of them were initially believed to have been spotted by security researchers who later discovered that others had already been exploiting them.""When vulnerabilities are exploited as zero-days they typically have a much more widespread effect on the world given that patches often lag by weeks once they are discovered,"" wrote Hanley.Hanley says that most of the vulnerabilities that are being exploited are simple to abuse. So while coding in Rust will help, more attention needs to be paid to the risks complex software presents.That work is already underway, through initiatives to harden the software supply chain and related projects.Amid the rush to Rust – which has Microsoft recruiting developers to rewrite C# code in Rust and Google donating to improve Rust tooling – it's easy to forget that security is a process, rather than a product.

Hyundai Motor Europe hit by Black Basta ransomware attack,"Car maker Hyundai Motor Europe suffered a Black Basta ransomware attack, with the threat actors claiming to have stolen three terabytes of corporate data.Hyundai Motor Europe is Hyundai Motor Company's European division, headquartered in Germany.BleepingComputer first learned of the attack in early January, but when we contacted Hyundai, we were told they were just experiencing IT issues.""Hyundai Motor Europe is experiencing IT issues, which the company is working to resolve as quickly as possible,"" Hyundai told BleepingComputer at the time.""Trust and security are fundamental to Hyundai's business and our priority is the protection of our customers, employees, investors, and partners.""However, after sharing additional information we had learned about data being stolen, Hyundai confirmed to BleepingComputer that they suffered a cyberattack.""Hyundai Motor Europe is investigating in a case in which an unauthorised third party has accessed a limited part of the network of Hyundai Motor Europe,"" Hyundai Motor Europe told BleepingComputer.""Our investigations are ongoing, and we are working closely with external cybersecurity and legal experts. Relevant local authorities have also been notified. Trust and security are fundamental to our business, and our priority is the protection of our customers, employees, investors, and partners.""The company did not specify what type of attack they suffered, but BleepingComputer learned the Black Basta ransomware operation conducted it in early January when they claimed to have stolen 3 TB of data from Hyundai Motor Europe.In an image seen by BleepingComputer, the threat actors shared lists of folders that were allegedly stolen from numerous Windows domains, including those from KIA Europe.While it is not known what data was stolen, the folder names indicate its related to various departments at the company, including legal, sales, human resources, accounting, IT, and management.Hyundai previously disclosed a data breach in April 2023 that impacted Italian and French car owners and those who booked a test drive.More recently, Hyundai MEA's X account was hacked to promote sites with crypto wallet drainers.Who is Black Basta?The Black Basta ransomware gang launched its operation in April 2022 and quickly launched a stream of double-extortion attacks.By June 2022, Black Basta had partnered with the QBot malware operation (QakBot) to drop Cobalt Strike for remote access on corporate networks. Black Basta would use this access to spread to other devices on the network, steal data, and ultimately encrypt devices.Since its launch, the threat actors have been responsible for a wide range of attacks, including those against the Toronto Library, Capita, American Dental Association, Sobeys, Knauf, and Yellow Pages Canada.A report from Corvus Insurance and Elliptic in November 2023 says that Black Basta is believed to have received over $100 million in ransom payments since its launch.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

"QR Code 'Quishing' Attacks on Execs Surge, Evading Email Security","The use of QR codes to deliver malicious payloads jumped in Q4 2023, especially against executives, who saw 42 times more QR code phishing than the average employee.February 8, 2024Email attacks relying on QR codes surged in the last quarter, with attackers specifically targeting corporate executives and managers, reinforcing recommendations that companies place additional digital protections around their business leadership.Making matters worse, phishing emails using QR codes (aka ""quishing"") can often get by spam filters, with attacks targeting users of Microsoft 365 and DocuSign successfully landing in email inboxes, according to a report published this week by Abnormal Security, a provider of cloud email security.In the fourth quarter of 2023, the average top executive in the C-suite saw 42 times more phishing attacks using QR codes compared to the average employee. Other managerial roles suffered an increase in attacks as well, although significantly smaller, with these non-C-suite executives encountering five times more QR-code-based phishing attacks, according to the company's report.Overall, the data demonstrates that attackers have executives — and other privileged users — in their sites, says Mike Britton, CISO for Abnormal Security.""If I'm an attacker, I want to attack the people that have the ability for me to get paid and have credentials that give me access to the most interesting information,"" he says. ""Or I want to pretend to be those people, because once again, social engineering requires that trust, [for a victim to think,] hey, this VP of sales or this VP of HR is asking me to do something, [making them] typically more likely ... to take action.""While QR codes have been around for three decades, they became much more popular during the pandemic, as restaurants and other businesses directed customers to contact-free and online ordering. In a business context, a top use case for QR codes is offering links to ease the sign-up process for multifactor authentication (MFA). Cyberattackers have hopped on: More than a quarter of QR code attacks (27%) in Q4 were fake notices of MFA, for example, while about one-in-five attacks (21%) were fake notifications about a shared document, according to Abnormal Security's report.Top executives see 42 times more attacks using QR codes than regular employees. Source: Abnormal SecurityBecause attackers hide their phishing link in an image, QR code phishing bypasses user suspicions and some email security products. In addition, malicious QR codes can be placed in physical spaces using a simple sticker, bypassing digital security altogether.""Attacks exploit users' inherent trust in QR codes, embedding them in everyday items like parking meters or posters,"" says Monique Becenti, director of product at mobile-security firm Zimperium. ""The success rate of phishing with QR codes will surpass traditional phishing methods because they often bypass users' typical suspicion triggers, such as typos in the URL, leading to a higher likelihood of scanning them.""Yet Another Way to Steal Exec's CredentialsFor the most part, quishing attackers who focus on executives are after the credentials — usernames and passwords — of privileged users. Credential phishing is the most popular form of email attack, accounting for 73% of all attacks through the vector and 84% of attacks using a QR code; and they often lead to more significant compromises, says Abnormal Security's Britton.""The primary goal is getting at a user to steal their credentials,"" he says. ""Once I have your credentials, I can do a lot more damage, and I can do a lot of lasting damage. If I have your credentials, I can log into your account, I can see who you've sent emails to, I can send emails pretending to be you, and I can create mail filter rules.""That last point is a common way to abuse mail credentials, Britton says. The attacker will create a blind carbon copy (BCC) rule that forwards all emails to the attacker's account.Further, ""threat actors also recognize that often multiple people have access to an executive's inbox, such as executive assistants,"" the report stated. ""Consequently, every individual who knows the login credentials for a VIP's inbox represents a potential entry point that can be exploited by an attacker.""Thwarting Quishing Takes Technology & Training the HumanThe good news is, since October, QR-code phishing has subsided to a large degree, after accounting for 22% of phishing attacks, according to human-risk management firm Hoxhunt. ""Since last October, we've seen evidence that email filters are catching up to the QR phishing technique,"" says Jon Gellin, threat team lead at Hoxhunt. ""As fewer of these attacks are bypassing email filters, there's been a resultant decrease in their popularity.""However, even if quishing subsides, it will remain a tool for attackers, much in the way that shortened URLs and image spam continue to be used in cyberattacks. The best way to protect users is to train them, Gellin says. About 5% of users respond to a phishing attack within the first few minutes, suggesting that a well-trained pool of employees can help blunt an attack.""As the QR phishing trend has shown, some threats will always slip past even the most sophisticated filters,"" he says. ""At that point, it's up to the human layer to have the skills and tools to deal with the threat effectively.""Training is important, but because a single failure can have a significant impact, technical controls are necessary, says Abnormal Security's Britton.""There, there are some phishing attacks that I've seen that even I have to get a second opinion from people because they look so real,"" he says. ""How do I expect an HR person to get that right every time? How do I expect an accounts payable person? How do I expect a financial analyst?""""Training is important, but we're going to fail, and it only takes one failure,"" he says.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Iran-Israel Cyber War Goes Global,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Iran-Israel Cyber War Goes GlobalWhat started off as posturing from the Islamic Republic has turned into more serious cyberattacks against the US, Albania, and more.February 8, 2024Iran's cyber conflict with Israel has reached global proportions, with cyberattacks against businesses and government agencies on other continents causing arguably as much ruckus as those in Israel itself.It's a classic case of cyber imitating life. While US military bases and international shipping routes are peppered by its proxy terrorist outfits — most notably, the dernier cri Houthis — Iran's cyber threat cloud has been spreading its attacks into the US and Europe, against targets perceived to be aligned with its bête noire.In a report published this week, Microsoft characterized this global proliferation as a ""Phase 3"" in Iran's hebraic cyber offensive.""This is highly likely to be part of the Iranian government's strategic pressure campaign,"" says a threat intelligence analyst from Recorded Future's Insikt Group, who chose not to be named for this story. ""Tehran is hoping to influence governments directly and not [get] directly involved in the conflict via the ability to impact economies. They are highly likely aiming to influence business communities to pressure their governments to support a cessation of Israeli military activities in the Gaza Strip.""Among the latest victims of this Phase 3 pressure offensive: an Albanian government organization and Iran's military guard itself.The Latest in Iran's Global Cyber OffensiveThe most recent known case occurred on Feb. 1. Albania's Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) disclosed on Facebook that a cyberattack ""which aimed to damage INSTAT's data has caused the Internet services of the official website and email to be interrupted.""In an official statement, the country's National Authority for Electronic Certification and Cyber Security (AKCESK) clarified that the affected INSTATE systems ""are not currently classified as critical or important information infrastructure.""On Telegram, the Iranian APT commonly known as ""Homeland Justice"" told a somewhat different story. Claiming the attack for itself, it described the event as more extortion than denial-of-service (DoS), with more than 100 terabytes of population and geographic information system data copied and then deleted from the organization's servers.As Microsoft noted in its report, Homeland Justice has previously targeted Albania, alongside other countries perceived to be in support of Israel. In a series of Telegram posts, the group framed the stolen data in the wider context of Albania's support of ""the terrorists,"" including Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian dissident group with ties to Israel's secret service.Meanwhile, not one day after Albania's statistics snafu, Iran's cyberattack net once again reached US shores, when the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned six officials with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC).The action follows a December intrusion into Vision Series programmable logic controllers (PLCs), developed by the Israeli-American company Unitronics, and utilized in both countries' critical infrastructure.""US authorities took remarkably fast action to sanction multiple Iranian cyber officials associated with these attacks,"" says Scott Small, director of threat intel at Tidal Cyber. ""This could provide limited deterrence against future attacks, but we also know Iranian cyber actors are persistently intent on attacking US-based targets, especially government entities.""Though it might at first seem short-sighted for Iran to unnecessarily drag the US into a cyber conflict, the Insikt analyst suggests that it could be a well-calculated risk.""Iran has been trying to de-escalate a kinetic tit-for-tat to minimize the risk of US retaliation against its territory. It is possible more aggressive and more global cyber operations will allow them to mitigate that risk while still contributing to the anti-Israel agenda,"" they suggest.The Three Phases of the ConflictAccording to Microsoft, Iran's pseudo-cyber war against Israel can be split into three distinct phases.Phase 1, during the initial days following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack, was rather amateurish, the report claims. Iran-nexus groups performed light opportunistic attacks, leveraged pre-existing access to claim attacks against Israeli organizations, and repackaged old and publicly available data as new ""leaks.""Phase 2, beginning in mid-to-late October, ratcheted up the volume. The number of groups working actively against Israel rose from nine to at least fourteen. Iran conducted ten cyber-enabled influence operations in that month alone, alongside more coordinated and destructive campaigns. Still, much of the winnings from its most successful campaigns were overstated.In Phase 3 the attacks have become even more honed, utilizing more advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), targeting more significant businesses and critical infrastructure operators, and weaving in more effective messaging aimed at undermining Israeli morale and pressuring Israel's allies.""This concern will only increase heading further into election season, since we know Iran has regularly sought to interfere with past US votes,"" Small warns.If recent months are anything to go by, we won't know until it happens what the next Iranian cyberattack will look like.""Recent cases demonstrate that the whole range of attack methods are considered fair game for these cyber operations, including Web app exploits, credential harvesting, and even ransomware and cryptomining. This creates a wide range for potential disruptions to critical operations, plus potential fuel for influence operations whether or not the attacks cause notable material impact,"" Small says.Read more about:DR Global Middle East & AfricaAbout the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
How 'Big 4' Nations' Cyber Capabilities Threaten the West,"February 9, 2024COMMENTARYThere are four nations deemed by the US and UK governments to pose the greatest threat to the West. They're called the ""Big Four"": Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.Each nation has its own overarching threat behaviors and agenda to meet its ruling government's ambitions on the world stage. Russia's cyber-threat activities are primarily focused on offensive cyber operations, China's are focused on cyber espionage, Iran's on influence operations, and North Korea's on financial gain.Events of the 20th century, developments since the dawn of the millennium, and the intense geopolitics since the start of 2022 have contributed to recent actions taken by the Big Four. Industry analysts see plenty of evidence to link cybersecurity offenses around the globe to nation state-sponsored groups associated with these four countries.RussiaA multitude of geopolitical factors have influenced Russia's actions in recent years, including NATO's expansion east across Europe to Russia's borders and NATO's support for Ukraine.Russia is forming greater economic and military partnerships with China, Iran, and North Korea to boost its economy and resupply its military hardware. After Europe closed its door to Russian oil, the country had to sell its natural resources to developing Asian markets. As a result, India imported 40% of discounted oil from Russia in 2023, up from just 3% two years earlier. Strong economic dependencies often produce an uptick in cyber-espionage operations due to the need for foreign policy information surrounding these deals.As Russia is engaged in open warfare, the state has conducted a growing number of overt attacks. Reports indicate that 16 different ""families"" of wiper malware have been used against Ukraine over the past 12 months, up from just one instance in the previous two years. ESET senior researcher Anton Cherepanov stated, ""this is the most intense use of wipers in all computer history.""Notably, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom are the world's top donors of Ukrainian military aid and are also the most targeted nations outside of Ukraine.ChinaIn 2023, China emerged as the world's second great power, with extensive ambitions to further its influence by way of global infrastructure investment through the Belt and Road Initiative and political domination of East Asia. China is assessed to be the most advanced threat nation in terms of both cyberattacks and cyber-espionage capabilities. Its strategic interests reside in:Preserving the existence and legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by reunification with Taiwan.Protecting China's national interests, including expansion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.Asserting China's power globally.These strategic interests are realized in several key areas. First, in 2015, China announced its Made in China 2025 plan, which aims to advance China's manufacturing base by rapidly developing 10 high-tech industries. If China can create advanced semiconductors, the Taiwanese monopoly on semiconductor manufacturing will be severely undermined and thus one of the main deterrents for a possible Chinese invasion will be removed.China also aims to emerge on the world stage as a hard counter to Western (and particularly US) dominance. As former US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Gen. Keith Alexander said, China is undertaking ""the greatest transfer of intellectual wealth in history.""IranIran's modern political landscape began in 1979 with the toppling of the monarchy and the accession of the religious-based Islamic Republic. Since then, Iran has cemented itself as a strong state with great influence in the Middle East.Iran's cyber characteristics fall into two categories: offensive operations and actions to exert influence to bolster the government. Since June 2022, multiple Iranian threat groups have deployed cyber-enabled influence operations (IO). This combines offensive operations with messaging in a coordinated and manipulative fashion to further Iran's geopolitical objectives by shifting perceptions, behaviors, and decisions towards the regime.In addition, tensions have been significantly high with Israel, leading to economic and covert military support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian areas.In 2022, Iran's cyber capabilities were considered the most basic of the Big Four. However, in 2023, Iranian state actors used increasingly sophisticated tradecraft, rolling out a larger number of custom implants and becoming much faster at exploiting the latest exploits. These demonstrate a clear jump in Iranian cyber capabilities.North KoreaA state of war has technically existed between North Korea and South Korea since 1950: The countries never signed a peace deal in the Korean War, only a ceasefire agreement. The North Korean leadership sees the state's and the Kim regime's survival as under direct threat from the United States and its allies. To shield itself from the perceived threat of imminent invasion, the Kim government has built a deterrent by aiming thousands of artillery pieces at South Korea's capital, Seoul, and by developing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles.This aggressive tactic has led to strict economic sanctions, inhibiting the outside world from trading with North Korea. In response, the state has conducted numerous financially motivated attacks and crypto heists to steal money to prop up the government and fund weapons. It also runs intellectual property theft operations. The United States is by far the most targeted nation, accounting for over 40% of targeting over the past 12 months. Second and third are South Korea and Japan respectively.What Lies Ahead?In the next 12 months, around two-thirds of eligible citizens in democratic nations will have the opportunity to vote in presidential or national elections. So, cyber-influence campaigns targeting elections are expected to increase throughout 2024 by all Big Four nations.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Deepfake Democracy: AI Technology Complicates Election Security,"February 9, 2024Recent events, including an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated deepfake robocall impersonating President Biden urging New Hampshire voters to abstain from the primary, serve as a stark reminder that malicious actors increasingly view modern generative AI (GenAI) platforms as a potent weapon for targeting US elections.Platforms like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini (formerly Bard), or any number of purpose-built Dark Web large language models (LLMs) could play a role in disrupting the democratic process, with attacks encompassing mass influence campaigns, automated trolling, and the proliferation of deepfake content.In fact, FBI Director Christopher Wray recently voiced concerns about ongoing information warfare using deepfakes that could sow disinformation during the upcoming presidential campaign, as state-backed actors attempt to sway geopolitical balances.GenAI could also automate the rise of ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" networks that attempt to develop audiences for their disinformation campaigns through fake news outlets, convincing social media profiles, and other avenues — with the goal of sowing discord and undermining public trust in the electoral process.Election Influence: Substantial Risks & Nightmare ScenariosFrom the perspective of Padraic O'Reilly, chief innovation officer for CyberSaint, the risk is ""substantial"" because the technology is evolving so quickly.""It promises to be interesting and perhaps a bit alarming, too, as we see new variants of disinformation leveraging deepfake technology,"" he says.Specifically, O'Reilly says, the ""nightmare scenario"" is that microtargeting with AI-generated content will proliferate on social media platforms. That's a familiar tactic from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the company amassed psychological profile data on 230 million US voters, in order to serve up highly tailored messaging via Facebook to individuals in an attempt to influence their beliefs — and votes. But GenAI could automate that process at scale, and create highly convincing content that would have few, if any, ""bot"" characteristics that could turn people off.""Stolen targeting data [personality snapshots of who a user is and their interests] merged with AI-generated content is a real risk,"" he explains. ""The Russian disinformation campaigns of 2013–2017 are suggestive of what else could and will occur, and we know of deepfakes generated by US citizens [like the one] featuring Biden, and Elizabeth Warren.""The mix of social media and readily available deepfake tech could be a doomsday weapon for polarization of US citizens in an already deeply divided country, he adds.""Democracy is predicated upon certain shared traditions and information, and the danger here is increased balkanization among citizens, leading to what the Stanford researcher Renée DiResta called 'bespoke realities,'"" O'Reilly says, aka people believing in ""alternative facts.""The platforms that threat actors use to sow division will likely be of little help: He adds that, for instance, the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has gutted its quality assurance (QA) on content.""The other platforms have provided boilerplate assurances that they will address disinformation, but free speech protections and lack of regulation still leave the field wide open for bad actors,"" he cautions.AI Amplifies Existing Phishing TTPsGenAI is already being used to craft more believable, targeted phishing campaigns at scale — but in the context of election security that phenomenon is event more concerning, according to Scott Small, director of cyber threat intelligence at Tidal Cyber.""We expect to see cyber adversaries adopting generative AI to make phishing and social engineering attacks — the leading forms of election-related attacks in terms of consistent volume over many years — more convincing, making it more likely that targets will interact with malicious content,"" he explains.Small says AI adoption also lowers the barrier to entry for launching such attacks, a factor that is likely to increase the volume of campaigns this year that try to infiltrate campaigns or take over candidate accounts for impersonation purposes, among other potentials.""Criminal and nation-state adversaries regularly adapt phishing and social engineering lures to current events and popular themes, and these actors will almost certainly try to capitalize on the boom in election-related digital content being distributed generally this year, to try to deliver malicious content to unsuspecting users,"" he says.Defending Against AI Election ThreatsTo defend against these threats, election officials and campaigns must be aware of GenAI-powered risks and how to defend against them.""Election officials and candidates are constantly giving interviews and press conferences that threat actors can pull sound bites from for AI-based deepfakes,"" says James Turgal, vice president of cyber-risk at Optiv. ""Therefore, it is incumbent upon them to make sure they have a person or team in place responsible for ensuring control over content.""They also must make sure volunteers and workers are trained on AI-powered threats like enhanced social engineering, the threat actors behind them and how to respond to suspicious activity.To that end, staff should participate in social engineering and deepfake video training that includes information about all forms and attack vectors, including electronic (email, text and social media platforms), in-person and telephone-based attempts.""This is so important — especially with volunteers — because not everyone has good cyber hygiene,"" Turgal says.Additionally, campaign and election volunteers must be trained on how to safely provide information online and to outside entities, including social media posts, and use caution when doing so.""Cyber threat actors can gather this information to tailor socially engineered lures to specific targets,"" he cautions.O'Reilly says long term, regulation that includes watermarking for audio and video deepfakes will be instrumental, noting the Federal government is working with the owners of LLMs to put protections into place.In fact, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just declared AI-generated voice calls as ""artificial"" under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), making use of voice cloning technology illegal and providing state attorneys general nationwide with new tools to combat such fraudulent activities.""AI is moving so fast that there is an inherent danger that any proposed rules may become ineffective as the tech advances, potentially missing the target,"" O'Reilly says. ""In some ways, it is the Wild West, and AI is coming to market with very little in the way of safeguards.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
5 AI Priorities to Stay Competitive,"February 8, 2024COMMENTARYArtificial intelligence (AI): Since the invention of the operating system, we haven't seen a technology poised to have such far-reaching impact on the way we work and live. And organizations are keen to get in on the action. In fact, according to a recent study by Avanade, in which we surveyed more than 3,000 business and IT executives globally, 92% of respondents agree that their organization needs to shift to an AI-first operating model this year to stay competitive.But rather than shifts, I see sprints. Many organizations are reacting to the hype, rushing to satisfy board curiosity and deploying AI somewhere (anywhere) to check a box. They're often jumping ahead of the important and tough work of finding the right problem for the technology (be it a new revenue stream, higher profitability, process optimization, or cost savings), understanding their AI readiness, and designing a road map that matches it.The technology industry at large has some important but tough work ahead, too, ensuring that we're leading by example and designing and applying AI responsibly. After all, just because we can use AI for everything doesn't mean that we should.Closing the Gap, Mitigating Bias, and MoreSo, as we all absorb the mania we were exposed to in 2023, I recommend that individuals, organizations, and the overall technology industry focus on these five priorities in 2024.Closing the gap between AI advancements and government regulations. Although the United States government and the European Union announced policies around the use of AI, we're still living with a Wild West-type framework. Advancements in the application of AI will require access to tons of data, and this will clash with privacy concerns. And yet we must address how to maintain privacy in a way that still allows innovation to happen. I believe there's a huge opportunity for technology firms to do what matters and come forward to invest in privacy-preserving technologies.Mitigating bias and ensuring ethical use. Mitigating bias in AI is essential for fairness and equality, as biased systems can perpetuate social inequalities. Accurate and reliable outcomes depend on unbiased AI, especially in critical applications like law enforcement and hiring. Public trust in AI technology hinges on its perceived fairness and lack of bias. Legal and regulatory compliance as AI governance evolves mandates vigilance against bias. I believe that ethical AI practice is crucial for a company's reputation and commercial success, reflecting a commitment to global and cultural sensitivity.Strengthening explainability. Closely tied to ethical use is that AI and everything surrounding it must be explainable, auditable, and defensible. Technology professionals must be able to tell the story of how the data is calculated, linked, and transformed to those who are asked to sign off on projects and budgets. Stakeholders will be wary of what they don't understand and what doesn't seem transparent, especially around fairness and bias.Developing AI talent. What expertise do you need to be a practitioner of AI? Yes, deep programming skills and a solid foundation in mathematics are table stakes, but gone are the days when you can throw something to a programmer in the corner who doesn't interact with people. An AI specialist needs to possess soft skills and collaborative capabilities. They'll be working with legal, finance, marketing, and human resources, and they must communicate in an effective and straightforward way.Embedding AI across the business responsibly. AI is a strategic business capability that can and should impact all parts of an organization, and it's going to foster collaboration like you've never seen. You must therefore have a business strategy for its use, assess the readiness of your people, processes, and platforms, and put a framework in place for its responsible use. This is a critical component of understanding and managing risk tolerance, being compliant, and most importantly, building confidence and trust in AI technologies.As the hype of last year settles, AI's transformative potential is there for the taking in 2024, if we can get these five priorities right. Let's get to work.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",emerging threats and attack techniques,marketing,FALSE
Cybercrime gang targeted jobseekers across Asia,"Crime gang targeted jobseekers across Asia, looted two million email addressesThat listing for a gig that looked too good to be true may have been carrying SQL injection codeSingapore-based infosec firm Group-IB has detected a group that spent the last two months of 2023 stealing personal info from websites operated by jobs boards and retailers websites across Asia.The actors, dubbed “ResumeLooters” by Group-IB, used SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks to steal databases from the sites. That tactic produced over two million email addresses, plus names, phone numbers, dates of birth, and employment history.""The initial victims that we identified were mainly job search websites. Additionally, the group focuses on selling data stolen from recruiting agencies,"" Nikita Rostovcev, a senior analyst from the cyber security firm, told The Reg.Rostovcev declined to name the retailers hit by the looters, but confirmed that they included ""e-commerce companies of various sizes, including some that are quite popular in their respective markets.""- Interpol's latest cybercrime intervention dismantles ransomware, banking malware servers- Either the FBI is recruiting in Iran – or some govt Google ad buyers are getting a lousy deal- H-1B fraud consultancies grow, with application abuse openly discussed online- Volt Typhoon not the only Chinese crew lurking in US energy, critical networksWhile SQL injection was the gang’s main tool, XSS scripts were used on four legitimate job search websites. The threat actors prepared fake profiles on job search sites that would inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by victims, allowing the attacker to steal information, manipulate content, or perform other malicious actions. Group-IB believes the main goal was to steal admin credentials, but found no evidence the gang succeeded with that effort.""The presence of this code on these pages does not necessarily imply that it was executed on every device. However, it does indicate the persistence of the attackers and their attempts to inject their XSS scripts into all possible input fields on the targeted websites. Group-IB has also found evidence that the XSS script was executed on some of the visitors' devices,"" noted Group-IB’s infosec analysts.Although all compromised websites were found at the end of 2023, Group-IB believes the attacks began as early as January of the same year.Some 70 percent of victims were in the APAC region, with only a minority elsewhere. The largest number of hacked websites came from India (12), with Taiwan (10), Thailand (9) and Vietnam (7) following close behind.Group-IB identified a malicious server that contained the logs of multiple penetration testing tools. The group favored open source tools –, like sqlmap, Acunetix, the Beef Framework, X-Ray, Metasploit, ARL, and Dirsearch.Commands on the server led Group-IB to believe that the threat actors were attempting to gain shell access on target systems to download and execute additional payloads and hunt for additional data while in control of a victim's server. However it's unknown if ResumeLooters succeeded.The threat actor's server contained an open directory in which the crims stored stolen source code pages, cookies and notes about victims. They failed to disable its directory listing, however, which led to its discovery.Group-IB traced the email address employed by ResumeLooters in their campaign to two different Chinese-language Telegram accounts, one of which listed the stolen data for sale. One account was named ""渗透数据中心,"" which translates to ""Penetration Data Center"" in simplified Chinese. The other was called ""万国数据阿力"" which translates to ""World Data Ali.""The Reg was told that many of the comments in the code were made in Chinese – supporting an assumption the attackers hail from the Middle Kingdom.Rostovcev commented that it is believed the threat actors targeted their home region, as it is more familiar to them. ®",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
MoqHao Android Malware Evolves with Auto-Execution Capability,"Threat hunters have identified a new variant of Android malware called MoqHao that automatically executes on infected devices without requiring any user interaction.""Typical MoqHao requires users to install and launch the app to get their desired purpose, but this new variant requires no execution,"" McAfee Labs said in a report published this week. ""While the app is installed, their malicious activity starts automatically.""The campaign's targets include Android users located in France, Germany, India, Japan, and South Korea.MoqHao, also called Wroba and XLoader (not to be confused with the Windows and macOS malware of the same name), is an Android-based mobile threat that's associated with a Chinese financially motivated cluster dubbed Roaming Mantis (aka Shaoye).Typical attack chains commence with package delivery-themed SMS messages bearing fraudulent links that, when clicked from Android devices, lead to the deployment of the malware but redirect victims to credential harvesting pages impersonating Apple's iCloud login page when visited from an iPhone.In July 2022, Sekoia detailed a campaign that compromised at least 70,000 Android devices in France. As of early last year, updated versions of MoqHao have been found to infiltrate Wi-Fi routers and undertake Domain Name System (DNS) hijacking, revealing the adversary's commitment to innovating its arsenal.The latest iteration of MoqHao continues to be distributed via smishing techniques, but what has changed is that the malicious payload is run automatically upon installation and prompts the victim to grant it risky permissions without launching the app, a behavior previously spotted with bogus apps containing the HiddenAds malware.What's also received a facelift is that the links shared in the SMS messages themselves are hidden using URL shorteners to increase the likelihood of the attack's success. The content for these messages is extracted from the bio (or description) field from fraudulent Pinterest profiles set up for this purpose.MoqHao is equipped with several features that allow it to stealthily harvest sensitive information like device metadata, contacts, SMS messages, and photos, call specific numbers with silent mode, and enable/disable Wi-Fi, among others.McAfee said it has reported the findings to Google, which is said to be ""already working on the implementation of mitigations to prevent this type of auto-execution in a future Android version.""The development comes as Chinese cybersecurity firm QiAnXin revealed that a previously unknown cybercrime syndicate named Bigpanzi has been linked to the compromise of Android-based smart TVs and set-top boxes (STBs) in order to corral them into a botnet for conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.The operation, active since at least 2015, is estimated to control a botnet comprising 170,000 daily active bots, most of which are located in Brazil. However, 1.3 million distinct Brazilian IP addresses have been associated with Bigpanzi since August 2023.The infections are made possible by tricking users into installing booby-trapped apps for streaming pirated movies and TV shows through sketchy websites. The campaign was first disclosed by Russian antivirus vendor Doctor Web in September 2023.""Once installed, these devices transform into operational nodes within their illicit streaming media platform, catering to services like traffic proxying, DDoS attacks, OTT content provision, and pirate traffic,"" QiAnXin researchers said.""The potential for Bigpanzi-controlled TVs and STBs to broadcast violent, terroristic, or pornographic content, or to employ increasingly convincing AI-generated videos for political propaganda, poses a significant threat to social order and stability.""",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
FBI's latest defense of warrantless S. 702 snooping is China,"FBI: Give us warrantless Section 702 snooping powers – or China winsNever mind the court orders obtained to thwart Volt Typhoon botnetAnalysis The FBI's latest PR salvo, as it fights to preserve its warrantless snooping powers on Americans via FISA Section 702, is more big talk of cyberattacks by the Chinese government.During a US House subcommittee meeting last week on cyber threats from Beijing, FBI boss Christopher Wray told lawmakers that ""702 is the greatest tool the FBI has to combat PRC hacking groups."" PRC being People's Republic of China.Wray cited an example he's used previously about how, last year, Section 702 of America's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allowed the FBI to observe Chinese government snoops trying to break into an unnamed US transportation hub and take action.""We were able to quickly notify the entity and share technical details, which enabled them to be able to kick the Chinese off the networks before harm could be done — before some of the more apocalyptic scenarios we've been talking about here could transpire,"" Wray told the House select committee hearing on competition with China.Section 702 is a contentious amendment to FISA that is supposed to allow US intelligence agencies to spy on foreign intelligence targets located overseas. In reality, the private communications of some US persons may be warrantlessly swept up in these Section 702 dragnets and analyzed by agents, which alarms privacy campaigners.Failure to reauthorize Section 702 ... would be a form of unilateral disarmament in the face of the Chinese Communist PartyThe amendment is due to expire by April 19 this year unless Congress votes to reauthorize it. Lawmakers have the option of tweaking the rules so that, for instance, warrants are required in certain circumstances or some other protections are put in place. The Feds aren't a fan of some of the changes to 702 right now under consideration, as they argue things like warrant requirements for all those queries they run each month will slow down and hamper investigations.""Failure to reauthorize Section 702, or for that matter, reauthorizing it in a way that severely restricted our ability to use it, would be a form of unilateral disarmament in the face of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Wray continued. ""I can assure the American people, the Chinese government is not tying its hands behind its back. It's going the other direction, and we need to do the same.""At yesterday's press briefing on China's Volt Typhoon crew infiltrating US critical infrastructure facilities' IT networks, Cynthia Kaiser, deputy assistant director for the FBI's cybersecurity division, revealed her agents, using spying powers granted under Section 702, ""also identified other Chinese-state cyber actors"" breaking into vital American systems.""And in fact, we only know about many critical infrastructure entities compromised by the Chinese, because of FBI FISA 702 collections,"" she added.Later on the call, when asked if Section 702 was used in the FBI's operation to remotely kill Volt Typhoon's KV botnet, Kaiser said she couldn't get into specifics. ""But I want to end by noting how critical 702 is to all of our operations, especially within cyberspace.""We don't know all of the details, and don't have a seat in the war room where the FBI and other US agencies fight nation-state snoops on the regular.But we do know, specific to the Volt Typhoon takedown: The FBI obtained warrants that allowed it to remotely search US-based routers that had been infected with backdoor malware by China. The Feds wanted to hunt for information about Beijing's espionage efforts before wiping that malicious code from the compromised devices.Keyword here being ""warrants."" It is possible for the FBI to get court orders to conduct searches on remote equipment and perform other special operations, and it has done so many times in the past. The Feds draw the line at having to get a warrant for each and every query they run that may involve a US citizen, resident, or organization, it seems.MotivationWithin the FISA Section 702 debate, the FBI is fighting to retain its powers to conduct, without a warrant, surveillance that may accidentally or otherwise vacuum up US persons' data – powers that have been abused millions of times by the FBI. The Feds last year said auditors determined FBI agents had achieved a 96 percent compliance rate for FISA queries.Drilling deeper, FISA Section 702 allows the FBI and its fellow federal organizations to monitor foreigners' electronic communications beyond America's borders. But if these emails, texts, and phone calls are with or about US persons, those individuals and organizations' data can get pulled in as well for analysis, along with anyone those US persons also talked to.It's a wide net, and this has led to extreme cases of misuse — especially from the FBI, which has used 702 powers to conduct warrantless surveillance on US citizens including protesters, political campaign donors, and elected officials including a US senator.In terms of cyber value, we've seen little evidence of queries providing valueBecause of these abuses, and, you know, the constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures, there's been a big push to reform Section 702 and require all US intelligence agencies to obtain a warrant before conducting a US person query.Currently, there are four bills in Congress to reauthorize Section 702. But only two of them, the Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act (aka the Protect Liberty Act) and the even broader-reaching Government Surveillance Reform Act of 2023, include a warrant requirement.""In terms of cyber value, we've seen little evidence of queries providing value, and in cases where it has, the Protect Liberty Act's exceptions for queries with consent (which critical infrastructure being targeted would certainly provide), queries focused on malware code, and metadata queries (which can map out unusual network traffic and intrusion attempts) mean that proposed reforms wouldn't inhibit operations,"" Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Security and Surveillance Project, told The Register.""The bottom line is the FISA 702 debate isn't about whether the authority is valuable, it's whether reforms unduly interfere with that value,"" he added. ""The answer is a resounding no.""- Volt Typhoon not the only Chinese crew lurking in US energy, critical networks- Congress told how Chinese goons plan to incite 'societal chaos' in the US- Four more months of Section 702 snooping slipped into $890B US defense budget bill- As NSA buys up Americans' browser records, Uncle Sam is asked to simply knock it offStill, arguing the Feds can't fight terrorism and other serious crimes perpetrated by foreign governments without warrantless searches of Americans seems like a shell game at best, especially in light of the FBI's Volt Typhoon disruption, which involved court-issued search warrants.""I think this is the same issue that has come up again and again in the government's rhetoric,"" Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, told The Register.""They continue to speak to what they view as the overall value of Section 702 surveillance without making the case as to why this necessitates violating the constitutional rights of Americans. And I think it continues to be a disingenuous argument when it comes to cyberthreats from China.""One week it's needed to combat fentanyl, the next it's international polluters, or cyberthreats from ChinaOther organizations also advocating for reining in government snooping powers agree with this assessment.""Remember the old television serials in which the antagonists often were monsters of the week, villains who'd show up for one episode to be vanquished by the heroes just in time for them to face a new monster in the next episode?"" Electronic Frontier Foundation senior policy analyst Matthew Guariglia said.This, he said, sounds an awful lot like Uncle Sam's strategy to convince the public of the need to renew Section 702.""One week it's needed to combat fentanyl, the next it's international polluters, or cyberthreats from China, or Russia,"" he told The Register. Maybe the Feds are just that busy.Ultimately, this surveillance tool, intended to be used overseas for national-security reasons, ""has morphed into an invasive domestic spying program which can and has been used to investigate regular law enforcement matters in the US without a warrant,"" Guariglia said.

New Coyote Trojan Targets 61 Brazilian Banks with Nim-Powered Attack,"Sixty-one banking institutions, all of them originating from Brazil, are the target of a new banking trojan called Coyote.""This malware utilizes the Squirrel installer for distribution, leveraging Node.js and a relatively new multi-platform programming language called Nim as a loader to complete its infection,"" Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said in a Thursday report.What makes Coyote a different breed from other banking trojans of its kind is the use of the open-source Squirrel framework for installing and updating Windows apps. Another notable departure is the shift from Delphi – which is prevalent among banking malware families targeting Latin America – to an uncommon programming language like Nim.In the attack chain documented by Kaspersky, a Squirrel installer executable is used as a launchpad for a Node.js application compiled with Electron, which, in turn, runs a Nim-based loader to trigger the execution of the malicious Coyote payload by means of DLL side-loading.The malicious dynamic-link library, named ""libcef.dll,"" is side-loaded by means of a legitimate executable named ""obs-browser-page.exe,"" which is also included in the Node.js project. It's worth noting that the original libcef.dll is part of the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF).Coyote, once executed, ""monitors all open applications on the victim's system and waits for the specific banking application or website to be accessed,"" subsequently contacting an actor-controlled server to fetch next-stage directives.It has the capability to execute a wide range of commands to take screenshots, log keystrokes, terminate processes, display fake overlays, move the mouse cursor to a specific location, and even shut down the machine. It can also outright block the machine with a bogus ""Working on updates..."" message while executing malicious actions in the background.""The addition of Nim as a loader adds complexity to the trojan's design,"" Kaspersky said. ""This evolution highlights the increasing sophistication within the threat landscape and shows how threat actors are adapting and using the latest languages and tools in their malicious campaigns.""The development comes as Brazilian law enforcement authorities dismantled the Grandoreiro operation and issued five temporary arrest warrants and 13 search and seizure warrants for the masterminds behind the malware across five Brazilian states.It also follows the discovery of a new Python-based information stealer that's related to the Vietnamese architects associated with MrTonyScam and distributed via booby-trapped Microsoft Excel and Word documents.The stealer ""collects browsers' cookies and login data [...] from a wide range of browsers, from familiar browsers such as Chrome and Edge to browsers focused on the local market, like the Cốc Cốc browser,"" Fortinet FortiGuard Labs said in a report published this week.",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
"Americans lost record $10 billion to fraud in 2023, FTC warns","The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says Americans lost over $10 billion to scammers in 2023, marking a 14% increase in reported losses compared to the previous year.To put this into context, Chainalysis says ransomware gangs also had a record year, with ransomware payments having reached over $1.1 billion in 2023.Over 2.6 million consumers filed fraud reports with the FTX the previous year, a figure almost identical to 2022. Imposter scams emerged as the most frequently reported fraud category, with notable upticks in business and government impersonation reports.Following closely behind were online shopping scams, trailed by reports concerning prizes, sweepstakes, and lotteries, as well as investment scams and business or job opportunity schemes.""Consumers reported losing more money to investment scams—more than $4.6 billion—than any other category in 2023. That amount represents a 21% increase over 2022,"" the FTC said.""The second highest reported loss amount came from imposter scams, with losses of nearly $2.7 billion reported. In 2023, consumers reported losing more money to bank transfers and cryptocurrency than all other methods combined.""The FTC added 5.4 million consumer reports to its Consumer Sentinel Network (Sentinel) secure online database last year, with more than 1.1 million reports of identity theft received through the agency's IdentityTheft.gov website.However, the data shared today by the FTC reflects just a fraction of the actual harm inflicted by scammers in 2023 since most frauds are never reported.Those who fell victim to fraud can report incidents at ReportFraud.ftc.gov or file identity theft reports at IdentityTheft.gov.After being included in the FTC's Sentinel database, the reports are made available to roughly 2,800 federal, state, local, and international law enforcement professionals. They help investigators track down fraudsters, making it easier to discover trends and educate the public against scam attempts.A full breakdown of reports received in 2023, including state and metropolitan area stats, can be found on the FTC's data analysis site at ftc.gov/exploredata.""Digital tools are making it easier than ever to target hard-working Americans, and we see the effects of that in the data we're releasing today,"" said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.Commentsitsonlym3 - 1 day agolooks like you have a typo/missing word(s) here, ""The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says Americans over $10 billion to scammers in 2023"".serghei - 1 day agoFixed, thanks!",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
VexTrio network of hijacked websites used to spread malware,"Meet VexTrio, a network of 70K hijacked websites crooks use to sling malware, fraudSome useful indicators of compromise right hereMore than 70,000 presumably legit websites have been hijacked and drafted into a network that crooks use to distribute malware, serve phishing pages, and share other dodgy stuff, according to researchers.This mesh of compromised sites is known as VexTrio, and has been mostly flying under the radar since its inception in 2017 or earlier, though lately more details about the operation have emerged.The process is simple, and mirrors the traffic distribution systems, or TDSes, that the marketing world uses to direct netizens to particular sites based on their interests or similar.In the case of VexTrio, tens of thousands of websites are compromised so that their visitors are redirected to pages that serve up malware downloads, show fake login pages to steal credentials, or perform some other fraud or cyber-crime.It's said at least 60 affiliates are involved in the network in some way. Some partners provide the compromised websites, which send marks to VexTrio's own TDS infrastructure, which in turn directs those victims' browsers to harmful pages. The TDS typically only redirects people if they meet certain criteria.VexTrio takes a fee from the crooks running the fraudulent sites for directing web traffic their way, and the miscreants who provided the compromised websites in the first place get a cut. We're told the TDS also sends netizens to scam websites operated by the VexTrio crew itself, allowing the criminals to profit directly from their fraud.In its January global threat index, Check Point on Friday labeled VexTrio a ""considerable"" security risk, citing its reach and sophisticated setup.""VexTrio is yet another reminder of how commercially-minded the [cybercrime] industry has become,"" Check Point veep of research Maya Horowitz commented.This follows an extensive investigation by Infoblox published last month, with the help of infosec bod Randy McEoin, that concluded VexTrio was the ""single most pervasive threat"" to its own customers. Of the TDS crew's 70,000-odd known domains, references or links to almost half were apparently spotted in those customers' networks.In its technical report, co-written by McEoin and staff researcher Christopher Kim, Infoblox disclosed signs of compromise that you can look out for on your own IT environments.The security shop has been tracking VexTrio for two years, and first flagged up the group in June 2022. Back then, however, ""we didn't fully appreciate the breadth of their activities and depth of their connections within the cybercrime industry,"" the biz said last month.- Malware loader lowdown: The big 3 responsible for 80% of attacks so far this year- Raspberry Robin devs are buying exploits for faster attacks- LockBit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children's hospital- Fortinet's week to forget: Critical vulns, disclosure screw-ups, and that toothbrush DDoS attack claimInterestingly enough, and perhaps as an indicator of the TDS's reach, one strain of malware pushed via VexTrio is SocGholish, aka FakeUpdates, which topped Check Point's list of the most prevalent malware in January, affecting four percent of observed organizations worldwide. This downloader even outpaced Qbot last month, which had a global impact of three percent, we're told.SocGholish, which is written in JavaScript, is usually triggered when visiting a compromised website, and targets Windows machines, pretends to offer a browser update that when accepted and run by a mark infects their PC with backdoor malware, ransomware, and other stuff. In January, SocGholish was observed bringing GootLoader, Dridex, NetSupport, DoppelPaymer, and AZORult onto victims' machines.Also, according to Check Point's report, and perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone who follows news headlines, ransomware crews had a decent start to 2024. This part deserves a big caveat, however. The security firm bases this info on about 200 ransomware groups' leak sites, and these aren't always the most reliable measure of which organizations have suffered infections, and by whom.Victims' names are frequently removed by the crims during negotiations, or sometimes they never even make the sites if they pay up quickly. Plus, extortionists aren't always the most honest folks.

"New Fortinet RCE bug is actively exploited, CISA confirms","CISA confirmed today that attackers are actively exploiting a critical remote code execution (RCE) bug patched by Fortinet on Thursday.The flaw (CVE-2024-21762) is due to an out-of-bounds write weakness in the FortiOS operating system that can let unauthenticated attackers execute arbitrary code remotely using maliciously crafted HTTP requests.Admins who can't immediately deploy security updates to patch vulnerable appliances can remove the attack vector by disabling SSL VPN on the device.CISA's announcement comes one day after Fortinet published a security advisory saying the flaw was ""potentially being exploited in the wild.""While the company has yet to share more details regarding potential CVE-2022-48618, CISA has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, warning that such bugs are ""frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors"" posing ""significant risks to the federal enterprise.""The cybersecurity agency also ordered U.S. federal agencies to secure FortiOS devices against this security bug within seven days, by February 16, as required by the binding operational directive (BOD 22-01) issued in November 2021.Confusing disclosuresFortinet patched two other critical RCE vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109) in its FortiSIEM solution this week.Initially, the company denied that the CVEs were real and claimed they were duplicates of a similar flaw (CVE-2023-34992) fixed in October.However, Fortinet's disclosure process was very confusing, with the company first denying the CVEs were real and claiming they were mistakenly generated due to an API issue as duplicates of a similar flaw (CVE-2023-34992) fixed in October.As later revealed, the bugs were discovered and reported by Horizon3 vulnerability expert Zach Hanley, with the company eventually admitting the two CVEs were variants of the original CVE-2023-34992 bug.Since remote unauthenticated attackers can use these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable appliances, it's strongly advised to secure all Fortinet devices as soon as possible immediately.For instance, Fortinet said on Wednesday that the Chinese Volt Typhoon hacking group used two FortiOS SSL VPN flaws (CVE-2022-42475 and CVE-2023-27997) in attacks where they deployed the Coathanger custom malware.Coathanger is a remote access trojan (RAT) that targets Fortigate network security appliances and was recently used to backdoor a military network of the Dutch Ministry of Defence.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

A look at Fortinet's week to forget,"Fortinet's week to forget: Critical vulns, disclosure screw-ups, and that toothbrush DDoS attack claimAn orchestra of fails for the security vendorWe've had to write the word ""Fortinet"" so often lately that we're considering making a macro just to make our lives a little easier after what the company's reps will surely agree has been a week sent from hell.It all culminated this Friday with the disclosure of yet another critical security vulnerability in FortiOS, impacting its SSL VPN.Tracked as CVE-24-21762, the 9.6 severity out-of-bounds write issue allows for remote unauthenticated attackers to achieve code execution. There's also evidence to suggest it's already been exploited as a zero-day.Security researchers have urged users to patch vulnerable VPNs as soon as possible since the vulnerability is understood to be easily exploitable.There are various different affected versions of FortiOS and different patches available. The vulnerability also impacts unsupported versions, so now is definitely the time to make that upgrade if FortiOS 6.0.x is still running.|Version|Affected|Solution|FortiOS 7.6|Not affected|Not applicable|FortiOS 7.4|7.4.0 through 7.4.2|Upgrade to 7.4.3 or above|FortiOS 7.2|7.2.0 through 7.2.6|Upgrade to 7.2.7 or above|FortiOS 7.0|7.0.0 through 7.0.13|Upgrade to 7.0.14 or above|FortiOS 6.4|6.4.0 through 6.4.14|Upgrade to 6.4.15 or above|FortiOS 6.2|6.2.0 through 6.2.15|Upgrade to 6.2.16 or above|FortiOS 6.0|6.0 all versions|Migrate to a fixed releaseThe only workaround recommended by Fortinet is to disable the SSL VPN. Disabling webmode won't mitigate the vulnerability, it said.Other vulnerabilities were also disclosed alongside it, such as CVE-2024-23113 – a critical RCE bug in FortiOS fgfmd daemon, but these haven't been exploited in the wild.Buggy bug disclosure and an angry kettleSome of you Reg readers will have been following the Fortinet-related coverage this week and perused the story about a confusing double bug disclosure on February 6. This was just the start of hell week.The story immediately attracted our attention since it's not too often we hear about two maximum severity bugs being disclosed on the same day, impacting a major security product like FortiSIEM.However, that's what happened on Tuesday with both CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109 appearing in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The confusing part was that both vulnerabilities were submitted by Fortinet, but both linked back to a separate, earlier October advisory, revealing no details about these seemingly huge new flaws.So, hungry vultures we are, we swooped down and picked that story up immediately, shooting Fortinet a request for clarity on the matter and why it hadn't published details on them.Many readers will likely have seen that story since it was among the most-read for a few days, but some may be wondering why we didn't update it with the latest available information per our usual high standards.It took Fortinet more than 73 hours to issue us with an official response. It came through after we started writing this on February 9.For those not in tune with how the media works, this is very, very poor form on the vendor's part. A response given to a publication even beyond just 24 hours, especially with no explanation as regards the delay, is considered unprofessional.In the meantime, the company has issued two separate statements to our competitors explaining what exactly has gone wrong with this disclosure. We didn't publish this for a number of editorial-related reasons, and prior to the statement issued today, we've only received apologies for the radio silence. Not even copies of the statements given to other publications.If a 24-hour wait is considered unprofessional, more than three days is a slap in the face.So, all of that is why our coverage hasn't been as timely as we, and you as readers, expect from us.But, since we're providing an overview of the vendor's week, what actually happened here was that it absolutely bungled the disclosure of these vulnerabilities.Firstly, Fortinet backtracked and said these weren't vulnerabilities at all, instead explaining that they were issued in error and were duplicates of the single vulnerability mentioned in the aforementioned October advisory – CVE-2023-34992.Then, within hours of this, the company backtracked again saying that yes, actually, these are two new vulnerabilities – two bypasses for October's CVE-2023-34992. This came after the researcher credited with the discoveries published the email from Fortinet confirming the findings were indeed actual vulnerabilities. Fortinet retained its 10/10 severity ratings, while the NVD downgraded both to 9.8.Fortinet's statement from today addressed the 'why' behind the disclosure, blaming it on ""exceptional circumstances.""According to a Fortinet spokesperson:Timely and ongoing communications with our customers is a key component in our efforts to help protect and secure their organization. Fortinet PSIRT policy diligently balances our commitment to the security of our customers and our culture of researcher collaboration and transparency.There are instances where confidential advance customer communications can include early warning on advisories to enable customers to further strengthen their security posture, prior to the advisory being publicly released to a broader audience. This process follows best practices for responsible disclosure to provide our customers timely information to help them make informed decisions.Due to exceptional circumstances that include the premature dissemination of mitigation guidance and in an effort to help protect our customers, Fortinet distributed its monthly advisory on February 8 ahead of its anticipated February 13 publication date to provide important details to customers considering these circumstances. For more on Fortinet's responsible disclosure process, visit the Fortinet Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT).That damned toothbrush storySecurity-minded readers or otherwise, you will all have surely seen the story circulating this week about Java-based, malware-laden toothbrushes being recruited in a 3 million-strong botnet that's DDoS-ing Switzerland.Unlike many major national newspapers, and even some well-read tech press, we brushed over this one as something didn't quite seem right about it. For Fortinet, it was yet another mess to clean up.The Swiss newspaper that originally published the story claimed a director of systems engineering at [you can guess the company] told their reporter during an interview that the toothbrush DDoS-ing was actually happening in the real world.After many strongly worded suspicions that the claim was false, and a litany of memes pasted over tech social media, Fortinet responded by saying the claim was simply just lost in translation and that there was no actual massive toothbrush botnet. It was just a hypothetical situation.The writer at the Swiss German daily who first reported the story snapped back, disputing Fortinet's response, saying: ""What the Fortinet headquarters in California is now calling a 'translation problem' sounded completely different during the research: Swiss Fortinet representatives described the toothbrush case as a real DDoS at a meeting that discussed current threats.""Stefan Zuger, the Fortinet engineer who gave the interview, provided specific details of the DDoS incident, including for how long the attack had been ongoing and the potential damage to the unnamed website it affected, the reporter claimed.The Swiss journo also said the article was proofread by Fortinet before publication and nothing in the report was corrected by the vendor.TGIF, right?The weekend will doubtless be a welcome reprieve, especially for members of Fortinet's publicity team who will have been working tirelessly to undo all the company-wide errors from the past week.To their credit, they will also be dealing with the response to the reports that were also published this week about Chinese cyberspies exploiting FortiGate vulnerabilities using custom malware.We at El Reg lovingly welcome errors and messes of all kinds. We hate slow news days, so long may it continue… just as long as we're not ignored while it's happening. ®",vulnerability reports,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
US govt ups bounty on Hive ransomware gang members to $15M,"Uncle Sam sweetens the pot with $15M bounty on Hive ransomware gang membersHonor among thieves about to be put to the testThe US government has placed an extra $5 million bounty on Hive ransomware gang members – its second such reward in a year. And it also comes a little over 11 months since the FBI said it had shut down the criminal organization's network.On Thursday, the State Department reaffirmed it will pay up to $10 million for information leading to the identification and/or location of anyone holding or held ""key"" leadership positions in the organized crime crew. The FBI has also put up an additional $5 million award for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of any person ""conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in Hive ransomware activity.""The multi-million-dollar rewards come a little more than a year after the FBI, working with international law enforcement, seized control of the gang's servers and websites following a seven-month covert surveillance operation.The FBI was as a result ultimately able to provide decryption keys to more than 1,300 current and previous victims of Hive around the globe, saving them a collective $130 million in ransomware payments and ""crippling Hive's ability to sting again,"" FBI director Christopher Wray boasted at the time.A few days later, the State Department offered a $10 million reward for intel on Hive ransomware criminals' identities and whereabouts, even seeking information on Hive members ""acting under the direction or control of a foreign government.""The crew, which appeared in 2021, is believed to have ties to the Russian state.- FBI smokes ransomware Hive after secretly buzzing around gang's network for months- Uncle Sam slaps $10m bounty on Hive while Russia ban-hammers FBI, CIA- As lawmakers mull outlawing poor security, what can they really do to tackle online gangs?- New kids on the ransomware block in 2023: Akira and 8Base lead dozens of newbiesChainalysis, in its 2023 review published this week, estimated that ransomware crews raked in more than $1 billion in extorted cryptocurrency payments from victims last year, compared to $567 million in 2022.The cryptocurrency analytics firm also noted that the Hive takedown likely played a non-trivial role in the 2022 drop in ransomware payments, which otherwise have been escalating since 2019.The FBI's $130 million estimate ""may not tell the whole story,"" the report noted, because it only takes into account ransoms directly averted by the decryptor keys. For its part, Chainalysis reckoned the Hive bust more likely averted at least $210.4 million in ransomware payments.""During the six months the FBI infiltrated Hive, total ransomware payments across all strains hit $290.35 million,"" Chainalysis observed.

Middle East Cybersecurity Teams Want More Budget,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Middle East Cybersecurity Teams Want More BudgetMeanwhile, cyber threats are spiking in the region.February 9, 2024More than half of cybersecurity leaders in the Middle East cite a lack of funding as the top challenge in doing their jobs.According to new research from Deloitte, some 51% of respondents cited the lack of funding, compared to 36% of security leaders worldwide.That said, cybersecurity spending in the Middle East and Africa is set to top $238 billion in 2024, according to Gartner — a huge rise from a projected $2.6 billion in 2022 — in light of increased attacks against targets in the regions.Guy Rosenthal, vice president of product at DoControl, says that is evidence of the focus and concern about cybersecurity in markets such as the Middle East.""It's very common even in markets like Europe and Eastern Asia for organizations to prioritize cybersecurity only after they reach a certain size,"" he says. ""Now that organizations in the Middle East are gaining attention from threat actors, they have to up their game — and therefore their spending on cybersecurity.""Easier to Start FreshSpending on cybersecurity varies from organization to organization, Rosenthal says, but ramping up a cybersecurity program is easier nowadays, and without the the technical debt of long-standing cyber programs.""[These security leaders] are free to explore and embrace new innovations like enterprise browsers to solve multiple problems like secure Web gateway, zero trust, etc. instead of embracing complex — and at times expensive — secure access service edge implementations,"" he says. ""There are pros and cons to starting fresh, and the pros, like being able to nimbly embrace innovation, are often overlooked.""Jose Seara, CEO and founder at DeNexus, says adoption of tools built on automation and artificial intelligence can be easier and faster to deploy, as well as more effective in detecting new generations of cyber threats.""With evidence-based data showing where their business and infrastructures are most vulnerable, what types of cyberattacks have the highest probability, and what's the potential return of risk mitigation strategies, [organizations] can optimize their cybersecurity budget to address the most acute cybersecurity weaknesses,"" Seara says.Cyber Training Is CrucialNearly 70% of respondents in the Deloitte report say training and certification programs are key to engaging, retaining, and developing cybersecurity talent.Tariq Ajmal, cyber leader at Deloitte Middle East, says training programs and certifications are available in the Middle East, especially with the prominence of the English language in the region's business ecosystem — particularly in cybersecurity.""Organizations across the region need to ensure their people get the opportunity to upskill themselves and evolve to keep up with the continuously changing landscape,"" Ajmal says.

Canada to ban the Flipper Zero to stop surge in car thefts,"The Canadian government plans to ban the Flipper Zero and similar devices after tagging them as tools thieves can use to steal cars.The Flipper Zero is a portable and programmable pen-testing tool that helps experiment with and debug various hardware and digital devices over multiple protocols, including RFID, radio, NFC, infrared, and Bluetooth.Users have been demonstrating Flipper Zero's features in videos shared online since its release, showcasing its capacity to conduct replay attacks to unlock cars, open garage doors, activate doorbells, and clone various digital keys.""Criminals have been using sophisticated tools to steal cars. And Canadians are rightfully worried,"" Canadian Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne tweeted on Wednesday.""Today, I announced we are banning the importation, sale and use of consumer hacking devices, like flippers, used to commit these crimes.""Champagne's announcement comes after a national summit on combatting auto theft hosted this week by the Government of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario.According to the Canadian government, around 90,000 vehicles (or one car every six minutes) are reported stolen every year, with car theft resulting in $1 billion in annual losses, including insurance costs for fixing and replacing stolen cars.The figures shared by the Canadian government when describing the car theft surge currently impacting Canada align with the most recent data shared by the Statistics Canada government agency, which shows an increasing number of car theft reports since 2021.Canadian police also reported that motor vehicle theft had the most significant impact on an increase in the national Crime Severity Index in 2022.The Canadian government's Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) department (and the country's industry and commerce regulator) says that it will ""pursue all avenues to ban devices used to steal vehicles by copying the wireless signals for remote keyless entry, such as the Flipper Zero, which would allow for the removal of those devices from the Canadian marketplace through collaboration with law enforcement agencies.""Flipper Devices: Cars built after the 1990s are safeWhile the Canadian government insists that the Flipper Zero is one of the reasons behind the current surge of car thefts in the country, Flipper Devices, the company behind the devices, says the gadget can't be used to steal vehicles built within the last 24 years.""Flipper Zero can't be used to hijack any car, specifically the ones produced after the 1990s, since their security systems have rolling codes,"" Flipper Devices COO Alex Kulagin told BleepingComputer.""Also, it'd require actively blocking the signal from the owner to catch the original signal, which Flipper Zero's hardware is incapable of doing.""Flipper Zero is intended for security testing and development and we have taken necessary precautions to ensure the device can't be used for nefarious purposes.""Amazon has also banned the sale of the Flipper Zero since April 2023 for being a card skimming device after the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency began seizing incoming Flipper Zero purchases in March 2023 due to its alleged use by criminals.CommentsEndangeredPootisBird - 1 day agoClassic, a penetration testing tool used more for crime than for legitimate purposesJimscard - 1 day agoExcept it can’t do most of the things described in the article.

"CISO Corner: DoD Regs, Neurodiverse Talent & Tel Aviv's Light Rail","February 9, 2024Welcome to CISO Corner, Dark Reading's weekly digest of articles tailored specifically to security operations readers and security leaders. Every week, we'll offer articles gleaned from across our news operation, The Edge, DR Tech, DR Global, and our Commentary section. We're committed to bringing you a diverse set of perspectives to support the job of operationalizing cybersecurity strategies, for leaders at organizations of all shapes and sizes.In this issue:How the SEC's Rules on Cybersecurity Incident Disclosure Are ExploitedManaged Everything? Vendors Shift Focus to ServicesDR Global: Q&A: Tel Aviv Railway Project Bakes in Cyber DefensesWorld Govs, Tech Giants Sign Spyware Responsibility PledgeThe DoD's CMMC Is the Starting Line, Not the FinishWhy Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingHow Neurodiversity Can Help Fill the Cybersecurity Workforce ShortageQR Code 'Quishing' Attacks on Execs Surge, Evading Email SecurityHow the SEC's Rules on Cybersecurity Incident Disclosure Are ExploitedCommentary by Ken Dunham, Cyber Threat Director, Qualys Threat Research UnitCyber hygiene is no longer a nice-to-have but necessary for organizations that want to survive the relentless barrage of cyberattacks being unleashed daily.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently adopted new rules that require publicly traded companies to report cyberattacks with a material impact. Failure to do so likely will result in financial penalties and reputational damage.While that's a boon for company stakeholders in theory, threat actors are seeing an extortion opportunity. For instance, the ALPHV ransomware gang allegedly breached MeridianLink's network in November, exfiltrating data without encrypting systems. When MeridianLink failed to pay a ransom to protect its data, ALPHV sent a complaint directly to the SEC outing the breach.It's a glimpse of how things could go moving forward in the fast-evolving world of extortion tactics, particularly given the sheer volume of opportunity for compromising companies these days. There were 26,447 vulnerabilities disclosed in 2023 according to Qualys analysts, and of those categorized as high-risk or critical, hackers pounced upon a quarter of them and published ""n-day"" exploits on the same day that they were disclosed.Thankfully, there are some steps companies can take to thwart this kind of pressure.Managed Everything? Vendors Shift Focus to ServicesBy Robert Lemos, Contributing Writer, Dark ReadingMore companies are opting for managing complex security capabilities, such as data detection and response.Threat management firm Rapid7 and data security firm Varonis announced new managed services this week, becoming the latest security companies to bundle complex security capabilities together in managed offerings.In many ways, managed detection and response (MDR) covers a lot of ground and, so far, has done well for vendors and their customers. Vendors have happy clients, exceptionally rapid growth rate, and a very high margin for the service. Meanwhile, businesses can focus on the threats themselves, leading to faster detection and response. Focusing on the data could improve the response time, but that is far from certain.Offering a managed version of an emerging security service will be an increasingly common approach, as the creation of an in-house cybersecurity capability is expensive, according to analyst firm Frost & Sullivan.""In light of the shortage of cybersecurity professionals, organizations are looking for ways to automate the process of threat detection and response,"" the report stated. ""The new generation of solutions and services promises to deploy machine learning and artificial intelligence, automating decision-making to improve the overall performance of the security stack.""Find out more about the move to managed: Managed Everything?

The tools usually make use of zero-day exploits for initial access and sell for millions of dollars, meaning that their target market tends to consist of global government clients and large commercial interests.This week, a coalition of dozens of countries including France, the UK, and the US, along with tech giants such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, and the NCC Group, have signed a joint agreement to combat the use of commercial spyware in ways that violate human rights.UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden announced the kickoff for the spyware initiative, dubbed the ""Pall Mall Process,"" which will be a ""multi-stakeholder initiative … to tackle the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercially available cyber-intrusion capabilities,"" he explained.More specifically, the coalition will establish guidelines for developing, selling, facilitating, purchasing, and using these types of tools and services, including defining irresponsible behavior and creating a framework for their transparent and accountable use.Find out how why commercial spyware pledge matters: World Govs, Tech Giants Sign Spyware Responsibility PledgeThe DoD's CMMC Is the Starting Line, Not the FinishCommentary by Chris Petersen, Co-Founder & CEO, RADICLCybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) and a harden, detect, and respond mindset are key to protecting defense and critical infrastructure companies.As threat actors like Volt Typhoon continue to target critical infrastructure, the US Department of Defense's Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) may soon will become a strictly enforced mandate.Companies that achieve adherence to CMMC (which has been aligned to NIST 800-171 at the ""Advanced"" certification level) will become a harder target, but true cyber threat protection and resilience means going beyond ""check-the-box"" CMMC / NIST 800-171 compliance. That means moving to ""harden-detect-respond (HDR)"" operations.Proactively identifying, fixing, and returning IT and operational weaknesses to a hardened state.Immediately detecting and investigating possible intrusions into the IT environment, 24x7.Hunting and rooting out embedded threats within the IT environment.Quickly containing, mitigating, and fully responding to incidents.CMMC/NIST 800-171 mandate most HDR capabilities. However, a company's rigor and depth in realizing them can make the difference between remaining vulnerable to the advances of a nation-state cyber threat or remaining protected.Here are the 7 critical HDR practices: CMMC Is the Starting Line, Not the FinishWhy Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingBy Grant Gross, Contributing Writer, Dark ReadingTabletop exercises can be an effective and affordable way to test an organization's defense and response capabilities against cyberattack.Cybersecurity drills come in many forms, but one of the least expensive and most effective is the tabletop exercise. These drills typically run for two to four hours and can cost less than $50,000 (sometimes much less), with much of the expense related to planning and facilitating the event.The common approach to tabletop exercises is old-school and low-tech, but proponents say a well-run scenario can expose holes in organizations' response and mitigation plans. And demand for tabletop exercises has grown exponentially in the past two years, driven by compliance issues, board directives, and cyber-insurance mandates.In fact, the nonprofit Center for Internet Security calls tabletops ""a must,"" stressing that they help organizations better coordinate separate business units in response to an attack and identify the employees who will play critical roles during and after an attack.Read more on getting the most from tabletop exercises: Why Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingHow Neurodiversity Can Help Fill the Cybersecurity Workforce ShortageCommentary by Dr. Jodi Asbell-Clarke, Senior Research Leader, TERCMany people with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and other neurodiverse conditions bring new perspectives that can help organizations solve cybersecurity challenges.The ISC2, which says the global workforce gap is 3.4 million, advocates for companies to recruit a more diverse population, which many interpret as meaning inclusion efforts around race and gender. While that's crucial, there's another area to expand into: Neurodiversity.Many top STEM companies, including Microsoft, SAP, and EY, have neurodiversity workforce initiatives. While most neurodiversity hiring programs originally focused on autism, many employers are expanding to include individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, and other (sometimes nonlabeled) differences.Neurodiversity is a competitive advantage: Some people with autism for instance excel in detailed pattern recognition and systematic thinking — perfect for jobs involving monitoring and detecting security breaches. ADHD and dyslexia meanwhile are associated with increased idea generation and the ability to see connections between new ideas — valuable for approaching problems in new and different ways.One problem these companies face is not finding enough neurodivergent talent. Fortunately, there are strategies to overcome difficulties in uncovering these individuals.How to recruit neurodiverse talent: How Neurodiversity Can Help Fill the Cybersecurity Workforce ShortageQR Code 'Quishing' Attacks on Execs Surge, Evading Email SecurityBy Robert Lemos, Contributing Writer, Dark ReadingThe use of QR codes to deliver malicious payloads jumped in Q4 2023, especially against executives, who saw 42 times more QR code phishing than the average employee.Cyberattackers are embracing QR codes as a way to specifically target executives: In the fourth quarter of 2023, the average top executive in the C-suite saw 42 times more phishing attacks using QR codes compared to the average employee.Other managerial roles suffered an increase in attacks as well, although significantly smaller, with these non-C-suite executives encountering five times more QR-code-based phishing attacks, according to the company's report.The focus on the upper tiers of an organization could be because of the effectiveness of ""quishing"" in getting past endpoint defenses, which may be more stringent on higher-ups' machines. Because attackers hide their phishing link in an image, QR code phishing bypasses user suspicions and some email security products.More than a quarter of QR code attacks (27%) in Q4 were fake notices about turning on MFA, while about one-in-five attacks (21%) were fake notifications about a shared document.How security teams can tackle quishing: QR Code 'Quishing' Attacks on Execs Surge, Evading Email SecurityAbout the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",marketing,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
UK to replace physical biometric immigration cards with e-visas,"By 2025, Britain is set to ditch physical immigration status documents such as Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs) and Biometric Residence Cards (BRCs) in a bid to make its borders digital, which is in-line with developed countries like Australia.Understand what the new Home Office development means for existing BRP and BRC holders, and what you need to do.e-Visas to replace biometric residence cardsPresently, students, workers, immigrants and their dependents from non-EU countries residing in the UK are eventually issued Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs), cards which are proof of their immigration status in the country. Much like e-Passports, these plastic cards contain a chip that can be used by a Border Force officer to cryptographically verify the authenticity of the document itself and a person's identity via biometrics (facial photograph and fingerprints) stored in that chip.Some developed nations such as Australia, much like the UK, also collect biometrics from immigrants but in contrast, do not issue physical cards or in-passport vignettes (physical visa stickers and stamps). Instead, applicants are granted an e-visa that can be verified online and serves a digital proof of their immigration status.All UK BRPs issued up until today are set to expire December 31, 2024—even if your immigration status is valid beyond that date, or has no time limit on it (i.e. permanent residents with an 'Indefinite Leave to Remain'). The reason for this being, while the UK was a part of the European Union (EU), regulations required the government to implement next-generation encryption technology into its immigration documents, and as such the UK planned on rolling out enhanced cards after the end of this year, while phasing existing ones out.Since post-Brexit, however, EU requirements no longer apply to the UK and the Home Office has decided to discontinue BRPs altogether by 2025.""You will not need a BRP from 1 January 2025. You'll be able to prove your immigration status online, without a BRP,"" reads a webpage on the GOV.UK website.""[UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI)] will update their information on how to prove your immigration status in early 2024. You do not need to do anything and your immigration status will not be affected.""Advantages and disadvantagesAn eVisa is an electronic record of a person's immigration status and provides customers with the ability to view and prove their immigration status digitally, explains Home Office. It removes the need for physical documents such as, the Biometric Residence Permit (BRP), ink stamps and visa vignette stickers in a customer's passport or the Biometric Residence Card (BRC).This also saves an applicant the inconvenience associated with submitting their physical passport to a consulate for visa issuance, waiting for weeks, and subsequently arranging its collection.Despite their drawbacks, a key advantage of physical documents, especially chip-based ones, is their ability to be reliably verified offline, given the basics of public-key encryption. When combined with security features such as UV holograms and watermarks built into these documents, the dependence on an always-online system is practically eliminated.In other words, one can even use an NFC-powered smartphone app to securely read and verify the authenticity of a BRP card (or an ePassport) without being connected to the Internet. The card holder's personal details and photograph—all digitally signed by the issuing government, are stored in the chip itself. Despite this, passengers have faced chaos at airports in the past when eGates went down.What happens should the internet-connected IT systems used by the airlines and border officials face an outage? In such a case, how can the identity of arriving passengers with eVisas, as opposed to physical biometric documents, be reliably verified?What will the new process look like?Because we are already in February, those with BRP cards expiring over the next few months may be wondering what they need to do.BleepingComputer reached out to the Home Office to better understand the upcoming changes and what will the new process to prove and renew immigration status look like.""EVisas provide secure confirmation of someone's UK immigration status and make it easier for those who need to check status, such as employers and landlords, via online services,"" a Home Office spokesperson told BleepingComputer.""Replacing physical immigration documents with eVisas by 2025 is a key part of the transformation and digitisation of the border and immigration system, delivering enhanced security and cost-savings for the UK public and greater convenience for customers and status checkers.""UKVI accounts to open for allOur understanding is that the physical biometric cards and printed visa stickers will entirely be replaced by e-visas, similar to the ones issued by Australia, where immigrants currently use the Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) system to prove their status digitally.Similarly, starting 2025, existing UK BRP holders are expected to register for a UKVI online account to view or prove immigration status.For a few years now, proving your Right to Work to an employer, or your Right to Rent to a landlord has already been a digital process, conducted through the GOV.UK website by using details from your physical document:Furthermore, millions of people with an 'EU settled status' or those who have used the 'UK Immigration: ID Check' app already hold a UKVI account and use e-visas to prove their right to enter and live in the UK.The upcoming changes are expected to extend these conveniences to nationals of all countries.An eVisa, much like a physical BRP, will be securely linked to its holder's unique biometric information to safeguard against identity fraud.Immigrants who already have an eVisa do not need to do anything while changes are being implemented, but are advised to keep their UKVI account up to date with current personal particulars, including changed contact details or details of a new passport.Starting this summer, the Home Office plans on providing airlines, train and ferry operators with integrated secure access to passenger immigration information to enhance border security and reduce unnecessary passenger delays.With the move towards e-Visas, public government bodies like the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the NHS in England and Wales will be able to automatically and securely access an individual's status when they apply to access benefits and public services.It is important to note, until the new system gets a green light, the process to renew an existing BRP or replace a lost one remains the same until the end of this year.Home Office customers including existing BRP and physical document holders should monitor www.gov.uk/evisa over the next few months for upcoming information on what they need to do and when.While the UK government is on track to deliver a digital border and immigration system, including plans to trial contactless entry using just facial recognition, there are no plans at the moment to replace physical passports with digital equivalents, such as those piloted by Finland, BleepingComputer understands.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

Kenya Detected Over 1B Cyber Threats in Q4,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Kenya Detected Over 1B Cyber Threats in Q4Officials attribute the massive volume to the nation's enhanced cyber threat monitoring capabilities.February 9, 2024Kenyan officials said more than one billion cyber threats hit the nation in the final quarter of last year.That's a massive jump from the 123 million cyber threats detected in the previous quarter. The Communications Authority of Kenya attributed the increase to a recent enhancement of the country's cyber-threat monitoring capabilities, as well as the increased exploitation of vulnerabilities by attackers targeting the increased number of Internet devices in Kenya.Local media reports said of the 1.2 billion detections, 13.2 million contained malware, and 9.7 million were brute-force entry attempts. It was unclear how many of the cyberattacks detected were successful.Edward Kisiang'ani, principal secretary for Broadcast and Telecommunications at the Kenyan Ministry of ICT, said the government is upgrading its threat detection systems, and training staff to deal with such threats.

Ivanti discloses fifth vulnerability,", doesn't credit researchers who found itSoftware company's claim of there being no active exploits also being questionedIn disclosing yet another vulnerability in its Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA gateways, Ivanti has confused the third-party researchers who discovered it.Researchers at watchTowr blogged today about not being credited with the discovery of CVE-2024-22024 – the latest in a series of vulnerabilities affecting Ivanti gateways as the vendor continues to develop patches for supported versions.The high-severity authentication bypass flaw only affects a limited number of supported versions, unlike the zero-days that came before it, and, according to Ivanti, it was discovered in-house.However, watchTowr claims its researchers were the first to bring Ivanti's attention to the bug on February 2, publishing screenshots of the emails exchanged between it and Ivanti as proof.Commenting on the above excerpt from Ivanti's advisory, watchTowr said: ""Today, Friday February 9, 2024, we are pleased to see that Ivanti has released an advisory for this vulnerability.""We did find this comment a little curious, but perhaps we have a new set of colleagues?"" It went on to say it was ""surprised"" about seeing the missing credit, but assumes it was done without malice.The vulnerability itself, to the delight of admins across the land, isn't as serious as the others that were disclosed over the past few weeks.In addition to fewer versions being vulnerable, those that applied the updated mitigation provided on January 31 are automatically protected.Those who applied the patch to their devices when it became available and completed a factory reset of their device(s) are also protected. There is no evidence to suggest it's been actively exploited as a zero-day, Ivanti said, although that's been disputed.The limited versions impacted by the vulnerability are:-Ivanti Connect Secure (version 9.1R14.4, 9.1R17.2, 9.1R18.3, 22.4R2.2 and 22.5R1.1)-Ivanti Policy Secure (version 22.5R1.1)-ZTA (version 22.6R1.3)A quick recapSimilar to Fortinet recently, Ivanti's been having a tough time with security of late.- Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security hole- Ivanti releases patches for VPN zero-days, discloses two more high-severity vulns- Ivanti and Juniper Networks accused of bending the rules with CVE assignments- Ivanti zero-day exploits explode as bevy of attackers get in on the actIn mid-January came the first reports of two zero-days in Ivanti's products being exploited by attackers that were either pro-China or state-sponsored by Beijing.Since then, Ivanti has continued to work on developing patches in accordance with its staggered schedule, which is to say it's developing patches for the versions with the most users, and working down from there. In the meantime, it released a mitigation to keep people safe while they wait for patches.This patching schedule was supposed to conclude on February 19, but in announcing the first patch at the end of January, Ivanti said this has been delayed.What it also announced alongside the first patch, and it would be funny if it weren't so serious, was that in fixing the first two zero-days, it found another two vulnerabilities, one of which was also exploited as a zero-day.Better yet, Ivanti also said attackers had devised workarounds for the mitigation it provided, so it was forced to make a new one and this is still working to the best of our knowledge.So that's four big security holes in the space of a few weeks… today's takes it to five.The zero-days were under ""mass exploitation"" status within days, since proof of concept (PoC) code was published before Ivanti could develop patches. It was suspected at the time that 1,700 devices had backdoors implanted in them.Underlining the severity of the situation, CISA issued its second emergency directive last week instructing federal agencies to disconnect the products entirely. This followed an initial advisory adding the first two zero-days to its ""must-patch"" list the same day Ivanti disclosed them.The UK's NCSC was also prompted into action today, publishing its own advisory urging immediate patches for all five Ivanti vulnerabilities. ®",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

Hands-on Review: Myrror Security Code-Aware and Attack-Aware SCA,"IntroductionThe modern software supply chain represents an ever-evolving threat landscape, with each package added to the manifest introducing new attack vectors. To meet industry requirements, organizations must maintain a fast-paced development process while staying up-to-date with the latest security patches. However, in practice, developers often face a large amount of security work without clear prioritization - and miss a significant portion of the attack surface altogether.The primary issue arises from the detection and prioritization methods used by traditional Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools for vulnerabilities. These methods lack the organizational-specific context needed to make an informed scoring decision: the score, even if critical, might not actually be critical for an organization because its infrastructure works in a unique way - affecting the actual impact the vulnerability might have.In other words, since these tools depend on a relatively naive methodology to determine a vulnerability's risk, they end up with primarily irrelevant vulnerability scores - making determining which vulnerabilities to address first much harder.Furthermore, they do not address many supply chain attacks, such as typosquatting, malicious code injection, CI/CD attacks, etc. This oversight misleads Application Security (AppSec) teams and developers into focusing on less critical issues, thus delaying the development process and leaving the organization vulnerable to significant attack vectors.Myrror Security develops innovative solutions to these challenges by revolutionizing how organizations detect, prioritize and remediate their supply chain risks. Myrror's platform ensures that AppSec and engineering teams tackle the right issues at the right time by utilizing binary-to-source analysis for every third-party package in the codebase. Unlike traditional SCA tools that assess impact using version-level detection in manifest files, Myrror uses a proprietary reachability vulnerability analysis algorithm. This algorithm identifies which vulnerabilities are actually reachable in production, thus enabling Myrror to prioritize security issues accurately.This Platform Review will guide you through the entire Myrror user journey, from the initial SCM integration to the remediation plan generator, and provide a concise overview of the innovations Myrror Security has introduced to prevent alert fatigue, empower your organization to work more effectively and protect it from the threats of the modern software supply chain. To get a personalized demo, visit their website here.Getting Started and SetupMyrror is designed for easy installation on the organization's existing source code management platform. When Myrror is connected to your SCM, a discovery process of the organization's dependencies begins. The organization can later select specific repositories for active vulnerability and supply chain attack scanning, providing a prioritized overview of identified risks.The Discovery SectionThis section enables you to take stock of the supply chain risk associated with your codebase and determine the actual threat landscape you're exposed to from your open-source dependencies.The Repositories tab shows you all the issues in each monitored repository and allows you to choose which to monitor and which to ignore. This will allow you to remove some noise associated with repositories that are not in active use, will soon be deprecated, or are simply irrelevant. This tab serves as the control panel over all of your repositories. It complements the issues screen by pointing you toward your most at-risk repositories - allowing for a project- or application-level ""bird's eye"" view of the threats.The Dependencies tab aggregates every open-source dependency in your codebase and creates a graph of all the repositories in which each one is used. This key overview allows you to get a complete picture of the open-source libraries your organization relies upon. Despite the immense increase in open-source repositories in basically every software project, organizations don't have any control over external dependencies; taking inventory of what is being used in your code is the first step to controlling what's happening.The Myrror DashboardOnce the installation is complete and the user chooses the repositories to scan, the Myrror dashboard is populated with information about your repositories, their dependencies, and the issues they contain. When the user chooses to monitor additional repositories or connect more SCM sources, the dashboard is automatically updated with more information about the new codebases.The dashboard provides high-level insights into the issues across the entire set of the organization's codebase, including:- Detection Status- Issues by category- Dependencies with Security Status- The Riskiest Repository- Issues per code language,- Status of Remediation- Out-of-data Dependencies- And moreThese charts and graphs generate a detailed and complete overview, providing organizations with clear insights into areas requiring the most work. Note the repository filter on the top right - this allows specific teams to get accurate information about their work and the repositories they are in charge of and export only the relevant data for them.The Issues ScreenThis is the core of the Myrror Security platform. Here, all your issues are prioritized and flagged according to their actual severity, reachability, and exploitability for a clear understanding of what to tackle next. Various parameters are organized into columns, offering more profound insights into each specific issue.Among these parameters, the reachability column sets Myrror apart from traditional SCA platforms. It assesses whether the issue is actually reachable in production, which factors into the prioritization - ensuring reachable vulnerabilities can be tackled first.But the platform doesn't stop at prioritizing vulnerabilities according to reachability - it also considers whether this is a direct or indirect dependency, whether a fix is available to remediate the issue, and whether an exploit has been confirmed to exist in the wild. All of these parameters help the platform prioritize issues accurately and reliably.You can see all the following pieces of information about each vulnerability:- Severity (taking all the above factors into account)- Origin- Reachability- Dependency File(s)- Category - Vulnerability / Supply Chain Attack (see more in the Detecting Supply Chain Attacks section)- Exploit Availability- Fix Availability- Dependency Relationship- First Seen- Original CommitFilters (including a repository filter) are available here too, along with an option to export the table and download insights for report creation. This assists security teams in maintaining records in local storage and generating internal audit reports. These reports, emailed to the user, contain comprehensive information directly from the platform that can be shared with other team members and stakeholders.Note that there are 3 different tabs available on this screen:- The ""All"" tab contains all the issues combined, providing data insights in a single page about the overall supply chain threat landscape - including vulnerabilities and attacks.- The ""recommended"" tab contains the specific issues recommended for remediation per severity and reachability - essentially your ""go-to"" pane when deciding what to tackle first.- Finally, the ""Low Risk"" tab has issues that you can deal with at a later point in time.Each issue also has its in-depth analysis, with insights on the impact, scope, and origin of the issues shown on one screen. This detailed overview provides external links to the CVE to learn more about it, as well as information about the affected repositories and a concrete remediation plan to ensure swift action can be taken on each issue.The primary tabs available on this screen are:- Details - a primary overview of the vulnerability or supply chain attack- Affected Repositories - a list of all repositories that depend on this package, allowing you to ""connect the dots"" across the entire monitored codebase- Remediation Plan - Myrror calculates the optimal path of remediation, ensuring that the smallest amount of newly-introduced vulnerabilities end up in the codebase after the remediation process is complete- Attack Overview (see next section for more details)Detecting Supply Chain AttacksKeep in mind that Myrror does more than just detect vulnerabilities - it also detects various forms of supply chain attacks - including but not limited to:- Typosquatting- Dependency Confusion- Malicious Code In Repo / Code Injection- CI/CD AttackWhen it detects those attacks, the detection mechanism and remediation plan might not be as straightforward as normal vulnerabilities. In those cases, Myrror will show a more in-depth analysis of the attack, enabling practitioners to grasp the situation and pinpoint the concrete link in the chain that's at fault. See below for an example of Myrror's analysis of a code injection attack:The Remediation Plan GeneratorPlanning your remediation efforts typically requires comprehending the new threats introduced during patching. In most cases, applying a patch results in a new set of vulnerabilities due to the new dependencies (and their transitive dependencies) it introduces.For every monitored repository, Myrror simplifies the issue remediation process by automatically calculating the number of fixes available for all the issues, how many new vulnerabilities will be introduced during the remediation process, and how many issues will remain at the end.ConclusionAppSec teams suffer from profound alert fatigue today, driven by an overwhelming amount of security issues and a lack of clear prioritization of what to work on first. In addition, most teams are completely unaware of the supply chain attacks they are exposed to and have no clear path for detecting them or offering proper remediation.Myrror's Reachability-based prioritization offers a way out of vulnerability hell. At the same time, their binary-to-source analysis mechanism enables detection of more than just simple vulnerabilities - and allows you to defend against a host of supply chain attacks.You can book a demo to learn more on their website here.",marketing,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
MacOS Targeted by New Backdoor Linked to ALPHV Ransomware,"February 9, 2024Researchers have discovered a new backdoor targeting macOS that appears to have ties to an infamous ransomware family that historically targets Windows systems.Researchers at Bitdefender say the so-called Trojan.MAC.RustDoor is likely linked to BlackCat/ALPHV. The newly discovered backdoor is written in Rust coding language and impersonates an update for Visual Studio code editor.Bitdefender in its advisory said there have been multiple variants of the new backdoor, and that it has been in action for at least three months.The macOS malware gathers data from the Desktop and Documents folders, along with user notes, and then compresses the information into a ZIP archive and sends it to a command-and-control (C2) server.""While the current information on Trojan.MAC.RustDoor is not enough to confidently attribute this campaign to a specific threat actor, artifacts and IoCs (indicators of compromise) suggest a possible relationship with the BlackBasta and (ALPHV/BlackCat) ransomware operators,"" Bitedefender researcher Andrei Lapusneau wrote in the company's report. ""Specifically, three out of the four command and control servers have been previously associated with ransomware campaigns targeting Windows clients.""The researcher also noted the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware is likewise written in Rust. The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware group traditionally has favored Windows targets such as Microsoft Exchange Services.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Raspberry Robin malware evolves with early access to Windows exploits,"Recent versions of the Raspberry Robin malware are stealthier and implement one-day exploits that are deployed only on systems that are susceptible to them.One-day exploits refer to code that leverages a vulnerability that the developer of the impacted software patched recently but the fix has either not been deployed to all clients or it has not been applied on all vulnerable systems.From the moment the vendor discloses the vulnerability, which usually comes with publishing a patch, threat actors rush to create an exploit and use it before the fix propagates to a large number of systems.According to a report from Check Point, Raspberry Robin has recently used at least two exploits for 1-day flaws, which indicates that the malware operator either has the capability to develop the code or has sources that provide it.Raspberry Robin backgroundRaspberry Robin is a worm that Red Canary, a managed detection and response company, first identified in 2021. It spreads primarily through removable storage devices such as USB drives to establish a foothold on infected systems and facilitate the deployment of additional payloads.Since its discovery, Raspberry Robin has continuously evolved, adding new features, evasion techniques, and adopting several distribution methods. One example of evasion trick it implemented was to drop fake payloads to mislead researchers.Check Point reports that it has observed an uptick in Raspberry Robin's operations starting October 2023, with large attack waves targeting systems worldwide.A notable switch in recent campaigns is the use of the Discord platform to drop malicious archive files onto the target, likely after emailing the links to the target.The archives contain a digitally signed executable (OleView.exe) and a malicious DLL file (aclui.dll) that is side-loaded when the victim runs the executable, thus activating Raspberry Robin in the system.Targeting n-day flawsWhen Raspberry Robin is first run on a computer, it will automatically attempt to elevate privileges on the device using a variety of 1-day exploits.Check Point highlights that the new Raspberry Robin campaign leverages exploits for CVE-2023-36802, and CVE-2023-29360, two local privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Microsoft Streaming Service Proxy and the Windows TPM Device Driver.In both cases, the researchers say, Raspberry Robin started exploiting the flaws using a then-unknown exploit less than a month after the security issues were disclosed publicly, on June 13 and September 12, 2023.As illustrated in the timeline diagram below, Raspberry Robin exploited the two flaws before security researchers first published proof of concept exploit code for the two flaws.Specifically, regarding CVE-2023-36802, which enables attackers to escalate their privileges to the SYSTEM level, Cyfirma reported that an exploit had been available for purchase on the Dark Web since February 2023, a full seven months before Microsoft acknowledged and addressed the issue.This timeline suggests that Raspberry Robin acquires 1-day exploits from external sources almost immediately after their disclosure, as their cost as zero days is likely too much even for larger cybercrime operations.Check Point found evidence that points to this theory as well, since the exploits used by Raspberry Robin were not embedded into the main 32-bit component, but deployed as external 64-bit executables, and also lack the heavy obfuscation typically seen with this malware.New evasion mechanismsCheck Point's report also highlights several advancements in the latest Raspberry Robin variants, which include new anti-analysis, evasion, and lateral movement mechanisms.To evade security tools and OS defenses, the malware now attempts to terminate specific processes like 'runlegacycplelevated.exe,' related to Use Account Control (UAC), and patches the NtTraceEvent API to evade detection by Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).Moreover, Raspberry Robin now checks if certain APIs, like 'GetUserDefaultLangID' and 'GetModuleHandleW', are hooked by comparing the first byte of the API function to detect any monitoring processes by security products.Another interesting new tactic is the implementation of routines that use APIs like 'AbortSystemShutdownW' and 'ShutdownBlockReasonCreate' to prevent system shutdowns that could interrupt the malware's activity.To conceal the command and control (C2) addresses, the malware first randomly engages with one of the 60 hard-coded Tor domains pointing to well-known sites to make initial communications appear benign.Finally, Raspberry Robin now uses PAExec.exe instead of PsExec.exe to download the payload directly from the hosting location. This decision was likely made to increase its stealth, as PsExec.exe is known to be misused by hackers.The researchers believe that Raspberry Robin will keep evolving and add new exploits to its arsenal, seeking code that has not been released publicly. Based on observations during the malware analysis, it is likely that the operators of the malware does not create is connected to a developer that provides the exploit code.Check Point's report provides a list of indicators of compromise for Raspberry Robin, which consists in hashes for the malware, multiple domains in the Tor network, and Discord URLs for downloading the malicious archive.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

New RustDoor macOS malware impersonates Visual Studio update,"A new Rust-based macOS malware spreading as a Visual Studio update to provide backdoor access to compromised systems uses infrastructure linked to the infamous ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware gang.The campaign delivering the backdoor started since at least November 2023 and is still underway distributing newer variants of the malware.Written in Rust, the malware can run on Intel-based (x86_64) and ARM (Apple Silicon) architectures, say researchers at cybersecurity company Bitdefender, who are tracking it as RustDoor.Potential link to ransomware operationsWhile analyzing RustDoor, malware researchers at Bitdefender discovered that the malware communicated with four command and control (C2) servers.Looking at threat intelligence data, the analysts found that three of them had been used in attacks potentially linked to ransomware attacks from an ALPHV/BlackCat affiliate.However, the researchers highlight that this is insufficient evidence to confidently link the use of RustDoor to a particular threat actor and that ""artifacts and IoCs [indicators of compromise] suggest a possible relationship with the BlackBasta and ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware operators.""With cybercriminals having less freedom in choosing their infrastructure and being restricted to hosting services that provide anonymity and condone illegal activity, it is common for multiple threat actors to use the same servers for attacks.While encryptors for the macOS system exist, builds for Apple M1 from LockBit created before December 2022, there are no public reports at this time of ransomware attacking Apple's operating system.Most operations target Windows and Linux systems as enterprise environments use servers running these operating systems.Distribution detailsRustDoor is distributed primarily as an updater for Visual Studio for Mac, Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE) for the macOS platform, which will be discontinued this year on August 31.The macOS backdoor is delivered under multiple names, including 'zshrc2,' 'Previewers,' 'VisualStudioUpdater,' 'VisualStudioUpdater_Patch,' 'VisualStudioUpdating,' 'visualstudioupdate,' and 'DO_NOT_RUN_ChromeUpdates'.According to Bitdefender, the malware has been under active distribution and have been undetected for at least three months.The researchers discovered three versions of the malware, which come as FAT binaries that include Mach-O files for both x86_64 Intel and ARM architectures but do not come bundled in typical parent files such as Application Bundles or Disk Image.Bitdefender says this atypical distribution method reduces the campaign's digital footprint and the likelihood of security products flagging the backdoor as suspicious.Backdoor capabilitiesIn a report this week, the researchers say that RustDoor has commands to control the compromised system and to exfiltrate data, and it can persist on the device by modifying system files.After infecting a system, the malware communicates with command and control (C2) servers using specific endpoints for registration, task execution, and data exfiltration.The commands supported by the malware include the following:- ps: Lists running processes, useful for monitoring system activity.- shell: Executes arbitrary shell commands, giving attackers direct control.- cd: Changes the current directory, allowing navigation through the file system.- mkdir: Creates a new directory, useful for organizing stolen data or malware components.- rm: Removes files, potentially for deleting important files or cleaning up traces of the malware.- rmdir: Removes directories, similar to rm but for directories.- sleep: Pauses execution for a set time, possibly to evade detection or synchronize actions.- upload: Sends files to a remote server, used for exfiltrating stolen data.- botkill: Terminates other malware processes, possibly to eliminate competition or free system resources.- dialog: Displays messages or prompts to the user, potentially for phishing or to execute commands with user privileges.- taskkill: Ends specified processes, useful for stopping security software or other processes interfering with malware.- download: Retrieves files from a remote server, used for bringing additional malware components or updates onto the infected system.The backdoor uses Cron jobs and LaunchAgents to schedule its execution at specific times or when the user logs in, thus making sure it survives system reboots.Moreover, it modifies the ~/.zshrc file to execute in new terminal sessions or add it to the Dock with system commands, which helps it blend in with legitimate applications and user activities.Bitdefender notes that there are at least three variants of RustDoor, the earliest one seen since early October 2023.The next one was seen November 22 and appeared to be a testing version that preceded an updated version observed on November 30, which includes ""a complex JSON configuration as well as an embedded Apple script used for exfiltration"" of files with specific extensions.The researchers provide a list of known indicators of compromise for RustDoor, which includes binaries, download domains, and URLs for the four command and control servers discovered.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a

Combined Security Practices Changing the Game for Risk Management,"A significant challenge within cyber security at present is that there are a lot of risk management platforms available in the market, but only some deal with cyber risks in a very good way. The majority will shout alerts at the customer as and when they become apparent and cause great stress in the process. The issue being that by using a reactive, rather than proactive approach, many risks just sit there, dormant, until an emergency happens.'Dealing with SOC Operations for more than a decade, I have seen nearly 60 percent of SOC Incidents are repeat findings that keep re-surfacing due to underlying unmitigated Risks. Here the actors may be different, however the risk is mostly the same. This is causing significant alert fatigue.' – Deodatta Wandhekar, Head of Global SOC, SecurityHQ.Combining Frameworks and Best PracticesThese risks can be prevented. A platform that combines the best practices of multiple frameworks is the solution to tackle this issue.What is NIST?The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plays a central role in presenting companies with an opportunity to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity posture to prevent or lessen the impact of cyberattacks. NIST provides a comprehensive and structured approach to assess, manage, and mitigate cybersecurity risks effectively.Read 'Building a Resilient Digital Future: NIST's Impact on Cybersecurity' for more details on NIST structures.What is MITRE?The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) framework is a knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). These TTP's are based on real-world observations, used by numerous threat actors, that have been made globally accessible to be used as the foundation for threat models and methodologies. MITRE has a 'mission to solve problems for a safer world, by bringing communities together to develop more effective security.'Read 'How the MITRE ATT&CK Framework Has Revolutionized Cyber Security' for more information on MITRE practices.What is NCSC?The National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) combines expertise from CESG (the information assurance arm of GCHQ), the Centre for Cyber Assessment, CERT-UK, and the Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure (National Protective Security Authority, NPSA). It is a London-based organization with the aim of making the UK a safer online place. They work collaboratively with other law enforcement, defense, intelligence, and security agencies and international partners to ensure their data is as accurate and actionable as possible.Risk Intelligence Combined with SHQ Response PlatformThe SHQ Response Platform from SecurityHQ started as a sophisticated cyber incident response solution designed for swift detection, analysis, and mitigation of security threats. It has now significantly evolved so that, according to a recent press release, 'SecurityHQ has combined its intellectual property and knowledge on risk mitigation and cybersecurity, and merged this with several recognized sources in the industry, including NIST, NCSC, and MITRE to provide actions on how to identify, map, and raise risks.''SHQ Response Platform will help reduce this alert fatigue by focusing on mitigating the common risk. Not just that, it will be quintessential to translate a mere one liner Risk Statement into an actionable mitigation plan. SHQ Response platform makes Risk Creation a very simple process by providing the user with a library of intricately linked Threat Events, Impacts and Controls by leveraging industry standard knowledge base of NIST, MITRE and NVD.' – Deodatta Wandhekar, Head of Global SOC, security- Calculate the impact of security threats on business.- Calculate the likelihood of risks happening.- Identify different tactics and techniques.- Know how to mitigate risks.- Access everything from a single platform point.What to Do NextOrchestrate and enable collaboration, prioritize incidents, visualize risks, and empower integration with Incident Response.Calculate the impact of security threats and the likelihood of risks happening, and highlight how best to mitigate these risks with Risk Management.No matter how great a tool's capability is, remember that a tool is only as good as the experts running/controlling it.

Former CIA Engineer Sentenced to 40 Years for Leaking Classified Documents,"A former software engineer with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been sentenced to 40 years in prison by the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for transmitting classified documents to WikiLeaks and for possessing child pornographic material.Joshua Adam Schulte, 35, was originally charged in June 2018. He was found guilty in July 2022. On September 13, 2023, he was convicted on charges of receiving, possessing, and transporting child pornography. In addition to the prison term, Schulte has been sentenced to a lifetime of supervised release.""Schulte's theft is the largest data breach in the history of the CIA, and his transmission of that stolen information to WikiLeaks is one of the largest unauthorized disclosures of classified information in the history of the U.S.,"" the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said.The sensitive information shared by Schulte included a tranche of hacking tools and exploits that were denominated as Vault 7 and Vault 8. It was published by WikiLeaks starting March 7, 2017, over a period of eight months.The charges stem from Schulte's actions when he was working as a software developer in the Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) from 2012 to 2016, where he developed tools pertaining to offensive cyber operations conducted by the CIA. According to evidence presented at the trial, he abused his administrator privileges to plunder ""copies of the entire CCI tool development archives"" in 2016.This information included methods to ""collect foreign intelligence against America's adversaries,"" including an arsenal of cyber weapons and zero-day exploits that made it possible to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers, and widely-used desktop and mobile operating systems.The leak, described as a ""digital Pearl Harbor,"" cost the agency ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" and ""severely harmed U.S. national security and directly risked the lives of CIA personnel,"" prosecutors said.Schulte was also accused of repeatedly lying to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his involvement as well as ""spinning fake narratives"" about how the information could have been obtained from CIA computers in an attempt to deflect suspicion.A subsequent search of his New York apartment in March 2017 unearthed a stockpile of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) encompassing approximately 3,400 images and videos, some of which were collected during his employment with the CIA from the dark web and Russian websites.During detention pending trial, he was found to have used contraband cell phones in jail to create anonymous, encrypted email, and social media accounts, and attempted to transmit protected discovery materials to WikiLeaks and publish classified information about CIA cyber techniques and tools.Schulte's goal, the DoJ said, quoting a journal maintained by him, was to ""break up diplomatic relationships, close embassies, [and] end U.S. occupation across the world.""""Joshua Schulte was rightly punished not only for his betrayal of our country, but for his substantial possession of horrific child pornographic material,"" FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said.

Belarusian National Linked to BTC-e Faces 25 Years for $4 Billion Crypto Money Laundering,"A 42-year-old Belarusian and Cypriot national with alleged connections to the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e is facing charges related to money laundering and operating an unlicensed money services business.Aliaksandr Klimenka, who was arrested in Latvia on December 21, 2023, was extradited to the U.S. and is currently being held in custody. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.BTC-e, which had been operating since 2011, was seized by law enforcement authorities in late July 2017 following the arrest of another key member Alexander Vinnik, in Greece.The exchange is alleged to have received deposits valued at over $4 billion, with Vinnik laundering funds received from the hack of another digital exchange, Mt. Gox, through various online exchanges, including BTC-e.Court documents allege that the exchange was a ""significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity,"" allowing its users to trade in bitcoin with high levels of anonymity, thereby building a customer base that engaged in criminal activity.This included hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, and narcotics distribution rings.""BTC-e's servers, maintained in the United States, were allegedly one of the primary ways in which BTC-e and its operators effectuated their scheme,"" the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said.These servers were leased to and maintained by Klimenka and Soft-FX, a technology services company controlled by the defendant.BTC-e has also been accused of failing to establish an anti-money laundering process or know-your-customer (KYC) verification in accordance with U.S. federal laws.In June 2023, two Russian nationals – Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner – were charged for their roles in masterminding the 2014 digital heist of Mt. Gox.News of Klimenka's indictment comes as the DoJ charged Noah Michael Urban, 19, of Palm Coast, Florida, with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft for offenses that led to the theft of $800,000 from at least five different victims between August 2022 and March 2023.Urban, who went by the aliases Sosa, Elijah, King Bob, Anthony Ramirez, and Gustavo Fring, is said to be a key member of the cybercrime group known as Scattered Spider, according to KrebsOnSecurity, as well as a ""top member"" of a broader cybercrime ecosystem that calls itself The Com.It also follows the Justice Department's announcement of charges against three individuals, Robert Powell, Carter Rohn, and Emily Hernandez, in relation to a SIM swapping attack aimed at crypto exchange FTX to steal more than $400 million at the time of its collapse in 2022.Powell (aka R, R$, and ElSwapo1), Rohn (aka Carti and Punslayer), and Hernandez (aka Em) are accused of running a massive cybercriminal theft ring dubbed the Powell SIM Swapping Crew that orchestrated SIM swapping attacks between March 2021 and April 2023 and stole hundreds of millions of dollars from victims' accounts.Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, in October 2023, said the plunder assets had been laundered through cross-chain crime in collaboration with Russia-nexus intermediaries in an attempt to obscure the trail.",vulnerability reports,news and industry updates,FALSE
"Hackers Exploit Job Boards, Stealing Millions of Resumes and Personal Data","Employment agencies and retail companies chiefly located in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region have been targeted by a previously undocumented threat actor known as ResumeLooters since early 2023 with the goal of stealing sensitive data.Singapore-headquartered Group-IB said the hacking crew's activities are geared towards job search platforms and the theft of resumes, with as many as 65 websites compromised between November 2023 and December 2023.The stolen files are estimated to contain 2,188,444 user data records, of which 510,259 have been taken from job search websites. Over two million unique email addresses are present within the dataset.""By using SQL injection attacks against websites, the threat actor attempts to steal user databases that may include names, phone numbers, emails, and DoBs, as well as information about job seekers' experience, employment history, and other sensitive personal data,"" security researcher Nikita Rostovcev said in a report shared with The Hacker News.""The stolen data is then put up for sale by the threat actor in Telegram channels.""Group-IB said it also uncovered evidence of cross-site scripting (XSS) infections on at least four legitimate job search websites that are designed to load malicious scripts responsible for displaying phishing pages capable of harvesting administrator credentials.ResumeLooters is the second hacking group after GambleForce that has been found staging SQL injection attacks in the APAC region since the latter's public disclosure in late December 2023.A majority of the compromised websites are based in India, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Australia, and Turkey, although compromises have also been reported from Brazil, the U.S., Turkey, Russia, Mexico, and Italy.The modus operandi of ResumeLooters involves the use of the open-source sqlmap tool to carry out SQL injection attacks and drop and execute additional payloads such as the BeEF (short for Browser Exploitation Framework) penetration testing tool and rogue JavaScript code designed to gather sensitive data and redirect users to credential harvesting pages.The campaign appears to be financially motivated, given the fact that ResumeLooters have set up two Telegram channels named 渗透数据中心 and 万国数据阿力 as of last year to sell the information.""ResumeLooters is yet another example of how much damage can be made with just a handful of publicly available tools,"" Rostovcev said. ""These attacks are fueled by poor security as well as inadequate database and website management practices.""""It is striking to see how some of the oldest yet remarkably effective SQL attacks remain prevalent in the region. However, the tenacity of the ResumeLooters group stands out as they experiment with diverse methods of exploiting vulnerabilities, including XSS attacks.""",data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,TRUE
"After FBI Takedown, KV-Botnet Operators Shift Tactics in Attempt to Bounce Back","The threat actors behind the KV-botnet made ""behavioral changes"" to the malicious network as U.S. law enforcement began issuing commands to neutralize the activity.KV-botnet is the name given to a network of compromised small office and home office (SOHO) routers and firewall devices across the world, with one specific cluster acting as a covert data transfer system for other Chinese state-sponsored actors, including Volt Typhoon (aka Bronze Silhouette, Insidious Taurus, or Vanguard Panda).Active since at least February 2022, it was first documented by the Black Lotus Labs team at Lumen Technologies in mid-December 2023. The botnet is known to comprise two main sub-groups, viz. KV and JDY, with the latter principally used for scanning potential targets for reconnaissance.Late last month, the U.S. government announced a court-authorized disruption effort to take down the KV cluster, which is typically reserved for manual operations against high-profile targets chosen after broader scanning via the JDY sub-group.Now, according to new findings from the cybersecurity firm, the JDY cluster fell silent for roughly fifteen days following public disclosure and as a byproduct of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) undertaking.""In mid-December 2023, we observed this activity cluster hovering around 1,500 active bots,"" security researcher Ryan English said. ""When we sampled the size of this cluster in mid-January 2024 its size dwindled to approximately 650 bots.""Given that the takedown actions began with a signed warrant issued on December 6, 2023, it's fair to assume that the FBI began transmitting commands to routers located in the U.S. sometime on or after that date to wipe the botnet payload and prevent them from being re-infected.""We observed the KV-botnet operators begin to restructure, committing eight straight hours of activity on December 8, 2023, nearly ten hours of operations the following day on December 9, 2023, followed by one hour on December 11, 2023,"" Lumen said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.During this four-day period, the threat actor was spotted interacting with 3,045 unique IP addresses that were associated with NETGEAR ProSAFEs (2,158), Cisco RV320/325 (310), Axis IP cameras (29), DrayTek Vigor routers (17), and other unidentified devices (531).Also observed in early December 2023 was a massive spike in exploitation attempts from the payload server, indicating the adversary's likely attempts to re-exploit the devices as they detected their infrastructure going offline. Lumen said it also took steps to null-route another set of backup servers that became operational around the same time.It's worth noting that the operators of the KV-botnet are known to perform their own reconnaissance and targeting while also supporting multiple groups like Volt Typhoon. Interestingly, the timestamps associated with exploitation of the bots correlates to China working hours.""Our telemetry indicates that there were administrative connections into the known payload servers from IP addresses associated with China Telecom,"" Danny Adamitis, principal information security engineer at Black Lotus Labs, told The Hacker News.What's more, the press statement from the U.S. Justice Department described the botnet as controlled by ""People's Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored hackers.""This raises the possibility that the botnet ""was created by an organization supporting the Volt Typhoon hackers; whereas if the botnet was created by Volt Typhoon, we suspect they would have said 'nation-state' actors,"" Adamitis added.There are also signs that the threat actors established a third related-but-distinct botnet cluster dubbed x.sh as early as January 2023 that's composed of infected Cisco routers by deploying a web shell named ""fys.sh,"" as highlighted by SecurityScorecard last month.But with KV-botnet being just ""one form of infrastructure used by Volt Typhoon to obfuscate their activity,"" it's expected that the recent wave of actions will prompt the advanced persistent threat (APT) actors to presumably transition to another covert network in order to meet their strategic goals.""A significant percent of all networking equipment in use around the world is functioning perfectly well, but is no longer supported,"" English said. ""End users have a difficult financial choice when a device reaches that point, and many aren't even aware that a router or firewall is at the end of its supported life.""Advanced threat actors are well aware that this represents fertile ground for exploitation. Replacing unsupported devices is always the best choice, but not always feasible.""""Mitigation involves defenders adding their edge devices to the long list of those they already have to patch and update as often as available, rebooting devices and configuring EDR or SASE solutions where applicable, and keeping an eye on large data transfers out of the network. Geofencing is not a defense to rely on, when the threat actor can hop from a nearby point.""",news and industry updates,regulatory changes and compliance,FALSE

'ResumeLooters' Attackers Steal Millions of Career Records,"The cyberattackers used SQL injection and XSS to target 65 retail companies and job recruiters, stealing databases with unique emails and other sensitive records.February 6, 2024Attackers used SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) to target at least 65 job-recruitment and retail websites with legitimate penetration-testing tools, stealing databases containing more than 2 million emails and other personal records of job seekers in just a month's time.Dubbed ""ResumeLooters"" by researchers in Group-IB's Threat Intelligence Unit — who discovered the campaign — the group targeted mainly victims in India, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Australia, stealing emails and other data containing personal information from people's resumes, researchers revealed in a blog post on Feb. 6. The data included names, phone numbers, and dates of birth, as well as information about job seekers’ experience and employment history.All told, the group — believed to be operating since the beginning of 2023 — stole several databases containing 2,079,027 unique emails and other records in attacks that occurred between last November and December, the researchers found. While more than 70% of victims were in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, Group-IB also identified compromised companies in other regions, including Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and the US.Specifically, attackers targeted 26 retail companies and 19 job-seeking sites, as well as a handful of organizations in professional services, delivery, real estate, investment, and other industries. The group then put the stolen data up for sale on Chinese-speaking Telegram channels.Cyberattacks Using Pen-Testing ToolsResumeLooters' attack vector is similar to that of another group called GambleForce, which Group-IB discovered targeting APAC region in September. Like that group, attackers used a variety of publicly available penetration-testing tools to target and inject malicious script into websites. In the case of ResumeLooters, common tools included Acunetix, Beef Framework, X-Ray, Metasploit, ARL (Asset Reconnaissance Lighthouse), and Dirsearch.""ResumeLooters is yet another example of how much damage can be made with just a handful of publicly available tools,"" senior threat analyst Nikita Rostovcev from Group-IB's advanced persistent threat (APT) research team wrote in the post. ""Both GambleForce and ResumeLooters employ very straightforward attack methods.""The team's investigation began with the identification of a malicious server at 139.180.137[.]107, on which they found logs of several penetration-testing tools, including sqlmap, that revealed the attackers were targeting employment websites and retail companies.The most common initial vector used by ResumeLooters is SQL injection via sqlmap, but in some cases attackers injected XSS scripts into legitimate job-search sites to carry out attacks, the researchers found. The attack occurs when the injection triggers the execution of a malicious remote script that displays a phishing form to steal visiting job seekers' data.In one of its XSS attacks, ResumeLooters even created a fake employer profile on a legitimate recruitment website, injecting malicious XSS script into one of the fields in the profile. The profile also included a link to admin.cloudnetsafe[.]com, which the researchers believe could be another domain associated with the group, though it was inaccessible at the time the researchers analyzed it.Evidence also suggested that ResumeLooters attempted to gain shell access on target systems to download and execute additional payloads, and try to find more data, while having full control of the victims' server. However, it's unclear if these attempts were successful, Rostovcev said.Group-IB has notified the victims of the companies targeted in the attacks ""so they could take all necessary steps to mitigate further damage,"" he added.Job Seekers in the Cyber CrosshairsThreat actors often target job seekers through various employment scams, due to the range of information that can be gleaned through communications with them, as well as the opportunity to sway them using social engineering.Indeed, threat groups from North Korea in particular are adept at targeting job seekers worldwide using fake job offers aimed at stealing their personal info and credentials. Attackers also exploit social media platforms, such as Facebook, to target those seeking employment, especially for remote work.Attacks like the ones by ResumeLooters and GambleForce are ""easily avoidable,"" yet company websites can be compromised due to ""poor security as well as inadequate database and website management practices,"" Rostovcev noted.The campaign is a reminder to organizations that they must prioritize cybersecurity and stay vigilant against evolving threats, he said. To do this, Group-IB made several recommendations for organizations to prevent both SQL injection and XSS attacks.For the former, organizations should use parameterized statements or prepared statements provided by their particular programming language or framework when linking together user input directly into SQL queries. ""This helps to separate user input from SQL code,"" Rostovcev wrote.Implementing a Web application firewall can detect and block SQL injection attempts, providing an additional layer of defense against various Web application attacks. Another tactic that can help prevent both SQL injection and XSS attacks is to validate and sanitize user inputs on both the client and server sides, ensuring that inputs adhere to expected formats and length constraints, according to Group-IB.To prevent XSS attacks, the researchers suggested, organizations also can escape special characters to ensure that they are treated as literal text and not interpreted as code before rendering user-generated content.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

Critical vulnerability in Mastodon sparks patching frenzy,"Critical vulnerability in Mastodon is pounced upon by fast-acting adminsDanger of remote account takeovers leaves lead devs scared of releasing many detailsMastodon has called admins to action following the disclosure of a critical vulnerability affecting the decentralized social network favored by erstwhile Twitter lovers.With a 9.4 severity score, exploiting CVE-2024-23832 potentially allows attackers to take over Mastodon accounts remotely.While very little has been released by way of technical details – allowing admins time to patch before attackers devise exploits – vulnerabilities with such high CVSS scores tend to lead to severe consequences on the affected product and are often relatively easy to exploit.""Due to insufficient origin validation in all Mastodon, attackers can impersonate and take over any remote account,"" said Eugen Rochko, CEO and lead developer at Mastodon, in a security advisory.""Every Mastodon version prior to 3.5.17 is vulnerable, as well as 4.0.x versions prior to 4.0.13, 4.1.x version prior to 4.1.13, and 4.2.x versions prior to 4.2.5.""Rochko said that full details of the vulnerability will be published on February 15, giving admins two weeks to upgrade to the latest version. He said that the disclosure of ""any amount of detail would make it very easy to come up with an exploit.""Mastodon is a decentralized social network, meaning it runs on separate servers, independently owned and operated by their respective administrators.Although this brings benefits like enabling specific rules and restrictions for different communities, it also means each must be updated by the admins individually. It's not a case where the entire platform can go down for maintenance for an hour and everything is fixed.""The underlying engineering of the Mastodon platform is different than other social media networks in that it is a decentralized system,"" said Elliott Wilkes, chief technology officer at Advanced Cyber Defence Systems.""Each instance of Mastodon is hosted separately from all others, and while there are common links to allow moving between instances, they are separate, owned, and operated by different people, with different teams managing the security of each. For this reason, each instance of Mastodon requires an economy-of-scale to support its operations, including people to manage infrastructure and security engineering.""This is one of the major trade-offs between Mastodon and a centralized social media company like Meta or Instagram, there's just not the same investment in security because there's not massive revenue supporting the platform, and each owner of an instance has to perform security management on their own.""There aren't enough details here yet to say exactly why Mastodon is vulnerable and other platforms aren't but different source code repositories won't share vulnerabilities unless there is an inherent flaw in one of the open-source packages that are shared between both products.""The good news for Mastodon users is that more than half of all active servers have already upgraded to the latest version in the space of a day, according to data from fediverse network stat collector FediDB.Such a fast patch rate was likely the product of how well the Mastodon community publicized the matter. Not only was Rochko's advisory shared across different instances rapidly, but as screenshots of admin panels show, the platform itself also plastered clear warnings, making it fairly difficult to escape the urgent need to update.A quick scan of the security advisory history at Mastodon shows this isn't the only security issue the platform has had to patch over the past year, with two critical bugs, CVE-2023-36460 and CVE-2023-36459, emerging in July 2023.- How not to write about network security – and I'm speaking from experience- Ivanti and Juniper Networks accused of bending the rules with CVE assignments- Asahi's Fedora remix dazzles and baffles on Apple Silicon- Polish train maker denies claims its software bricked rolling stock maintained by competitorBoth were reported by German pentesting outfit Cure53 during a Mozilla-requested audit. The first scored a near-maximum 9.9 severity rating and involved the abuse of Mastodon's media processing code.Using specially crafted media files could have allowed attackers to create or overwrite any files, allowing for denial of service or remote code execution.The second involved bypassing Mastodon's HTML sanitization to include malicious code in preview cards.""This introduces a vector for Cross-site-scripting (XSS) payloads that can be rendered in the user's browser when a preview card for a malicious link is clicked through,"" the advisory reads. ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
EquiLend back in action as ransom payment rumors swirl,"EquiLend back in the saddle as ransom payment rumors swirlStill no word on how the intruders broke in or the full extent of any possible data compromiseGlobal securities finance tech company EquiLend's systems are now back online after announcing a disruptive ransomware attack nearly two weeks ago.EquiLend was founded in 2001 by some of Wall Street's biggest players – its board of directors includes BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and more – and is primarily known for its Next Generation Trading (NGT) platform, which underpins a large chunk of the sector's securities lending.The platform transacts $113.5 billion every day between more than 120 companies across more than 40 markets. The company also has regulatory tech, data analytics, and securities finance arms.Providing regular updates via a dedicated web page, EquiLend almost completed its full restoration last week, waiting only for its data and analytics solutions to get back up and running.""As our internal team and third-party experts have continued working diligently on recovery, we have reached a much-anticipated milestone: All EquiLend client-facing services are now available,"" said the Wall Street staple.""We look forward to providing the high-quality service and user experience our clients have come to expect from us across all our services, and we remain incredibly grateful for your patience and support as we worked up to this point.""We have and will continue to keep our clients informed with relevant updates. Clients whose questions are not answered by the frequently asked questions linked on this page may contact their client relationship manager.""EquiLend began the full restoration after it pulled systems offline following the discovery of the malicious behavior. According to cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont, LockBit claimed responsibility for the attack but never posted EquiLend to its leak blog, an observation he claims suggests the company negotiated a ransom payment.For clarity, it must be said that EquiLend has not commented on whether a ransom was paid or not. We contacted the business for a comment but it didn't immediately respond.A ransomware group's leak site serves as one of the key tools available to cyber extortionists. The idea is that if a ransom agreement can't be met swiftly, the victim's details are posted online so everyone knows the organization is suffering a ransomware incident.The hope, then, is that the negotiations will be hurried along before the victim's data is posted online – the next move for cybercriminals looking to apply pressure to victims – which can include sensitive identity documents such as passport scans of staff, for example.At the time of the incident's announcement, EquiLend was vocal about how proud it is of its ""rigorous backups,"" hinting that it may snub LockBit's demands and restore itself from those backups instead.As a company whose services are so critical to the smooth running of such a lucrative industry, EquiLend's incentive to pay would have been significant, despite the practice being strictly discouraged by the US and many other nations.The company updated its FAQ page this week to reflect the system restoration but didn't update other sections regarding questions around how the attackers broke in.Nor has EquiLend updated its communication regarding whether any data had been lifted from its systems. However, the official line appears to be carefully worded to confirm client transaction data is safe.- New kids on the ransomware block in 2023: Akira and 8Base lead dozens of newbies- Ignore Uncle Sam's 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your peril- Lurie Children's Hospital back to pen and paper after cyberattack- Interpol's latest cybercrime intervention dismantles ransomware, banking malware servers""While we are continuing to investigate, based on the review to date, we have not identified evidence that client transaction data was accessed or exfiltrated in the cybersecurity incident,"" it said. ""We will continue to share pertinent updates as they become available.""If LockBit was indeed at fault for this, its double extortion MO likely saw one of its affiliates steal a hefty chunk of data to use as leverage for ransom negotiations down the line, if it came to it.Paying a ransom never guarantees the return or destruction of data on the cybercriminals' part, nor does it guarantee the victim will be supplied with a decryptor. That said, the ransomware business model would suffer substantially if decryptors weren't given in exchange for payment.At the time of the attack, there were questions about how disruptive the attack would be, with early signs pointing to possible issues around service quality due to staff resorting to manual operations.However, experts speaking to us at the time expected minimal disruption to EquiLend's business as the effects of disrupted operations, such as revenue losses, would most likely be contained for the most part.The attack came at a difficult time for the company, a week after it announced the sale of a majority stake of its business to private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe – a deal expected to close before the end of the year. ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Netherlands reveals Chinese spies attacked its defense dept,"Chinese Coathanger malware hung out to dry by Dutch defense departmentAttack happened in 2023 using a bespoke backdoor, confirming year-old suspicionsDutch authorities are lifting the curtain on an attempted cyberattack last year at its Ministry of Defense (MoD), blaming Chinese state-sponsored attackers for the espionage-focused intrusion.Specialists from the Netherlands' Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) and the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) were called in to investigate an intrusion at an MOD network last year, uncovering a previously unseen malware they're calling Coathanger.The name, authorities said, was conjured up based on the ""peculiar phrase"" displayed by the malware when encrypting the configuration on disk: ""She took his coat and hung it up.""A deep dive into Coathanger's code revealed the remote access trojan (RAT) was purpose-built for Fortinet's FortiGate next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) and the initial access to the MoD's network was gained through exploiting CVE-2022-42475.According to the MIVD and AIVD, the RAT operates outside of traditional detection measures and acts as a second-stage malware, mainly to establish persistent access for attackers, surviving reboots and firmware upgrades.Even fully patched FortiGate devices could still have Coathanger installed if they were compromised before upgrading.In the cybersecurity advisory published today, authorities said the malware was highly stealthy and difficult to detect using default FortiGate CLI commands, since Coathanger hooks most system calls that could identify it as malicious.They also made clear that Coathanger is definitely different from BOLDMOVE, another RAT targeting FortiGate appliances.""For the first time, the MIVD has chosen to make public a technical report on the working methods of Chinese hackers. It is important to attribute such espionage activities by China,"" said defense minister Kajsa Ollongren in an automatically translated statement. ""In this way, we increase international resilience against this type of cyber espionage.""The advisory also noted that Dutch authorities had previously spotted Coathanger present on other victims' networks too, prior to the incident at the MOD.As for attribution, MIVD and AIVD said they can pin Coathanger to Chinese state-sponsored attackers with ""high confidence.""""MIVD and AIVD emphasize that this incident does not stand on its own, but is part of a wider trend of Chinese political espionage against the Netherlands and its allies,"" the advisory reads.- Where there's a will, there's a way to get US chips into China- China 'readies production' of homegrown high-bandwidth memory- Uncle Sam designates more Chinese tech slingers as military collaborators- Congress told how Chinese goons plan to incite 'societal chaos' in the USThe attackers responsible for the attack were known for conducting ""wide and opportunistic"" scans for exposed FortiGate appliances vulnerable to CVE-2022-42475 and then exploiting it using an obfuscated connection.After gaining an initial foothold inside the network, which was used by the MOD's research and development division, the attackers performed reconnaissance and stole a list of user accounts from the Active Directory server.Not much else was said about the attacker's activity, other than the fact that the overall impact of the intrusion was limited thanks to the MOD's network segmentation.For those worried about whether Chinese cyberspies are lurking in their firewall, the Joint Signal Cyber Unit of the Netherlands (JCSU-NL) published a full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) and various detection methods on its GitHub page.The collection of materials includes YARA rules, a JA3 hash, CLI commands, file checksums, and more. The authorities said each detection method should be seen as independent and used together since some focus on general IOCs and others were developed to spot Coathanger activity specifically.If there is evidence of compromise, it's possible other hosts that are reachable by the FortiGate device are also compromised. There is also an increased likelihood that attackers may perform hands-on-keyboard attacks.Affected users should isolate their device immediately, collect and review logs, and consider calling in third-party digital forensics specialists, the advisory reads. Victims should also inform their country's cybersecurity authority: NCSC, CISA, etc.The only way to remove Coathanger from an infected device is to completely reformat the device, before reinstalling and reconfiguring it.Whiffs of China's involvement in CVE-2022-42475 exploits have long been suspected, but for the first time they're confirmed today.First disclosed in December 2022, a month later Fortinet said it was aware that the vulnerability was tied to the breach of a government or government-related organization that had been infected with custom-made malware.At the time, no fingers were officially pointed other than the fact that this custom malware was compiled on a machine in the UTC+8 timezone, so realistically it was most likely going to be either China or Russia.China was also accused of being behind exploits of separate Fortinet bug in March, again using bespoke malware for the purposes of cyber espionage. ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Fortinet FortiSIEM hit by two 10/10 severity vulns,"Double trouble for Fortinet as it issues critical FortiSIEM vulnsPlease stand by 73 hours for vendor response...*Updated Fortinet's FortiSIEM product is vulnerable to two maximum-severity security vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution, or at least according to two freshly published CVEs.*Both CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109 have been assigned scores of 10 on the CVSS scale, suggesting exploits can be carried out remotely by unauthenticated attackers, are low in complexity, and require no user interaction to pull off.In registering the CVE identities for the vulnerabilities, Fortinet linked to its own advisory to provide more information, but the link directs users to an older issue that was addressed in early October 2023.""Multiple improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiSIEM supervisor may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute unauthorized commands via crafted API requests,"" the advisory's description of the vulnerability reads.Taking a glance at older, cached versions of the same advisory, we can see that the list of affected products has been recently updated, adding additional FortiSIEM versions. Despite Fortinet's advisory not being officially updated (yet), it suggests the two new vulnerabilities may be similar in nature to the one fixed in October, affecting newer versions of FortiSIEM.The Register asked Fortinet for clarity on the matter but did not receive a response.We also spoke to application security expert Sean Wright, who said the most recent two vulnerabilities in FortiSIEM will likely be classified as the same vulnerability from October (CVE-2023-34992), or at least a variation of it that impacts different or additional versions.Hopefully Fortinet will provide some clarity on the matter in the coming days, although discerning the differences between vulnerabilities, especially in the early days of disclosure, can often be confusing for security pros sifting through conflicting details as we are here with the yet-to-be-updated advisory.- Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security hole- Researchers remotely exploit devices used to manage safe aircraft landings and takeoffs- Critical vulnerability in Mastodon is pounced upon by fast-acting admins- Cloudflare sheds more light on Thanksgiving security breach in which tokens, source code accessed by suspected spiesAlthough there is no known publicly available exploit code available, Fortinet customers will want to get these vulnerabilities sorted out as soon as possible given their severity.The following versions are confirmed to be vulnerable:-7.1.0 through 7.1.1-7.0.0 through 7.0.2-6.7.0 through 6.7.8-6.6.0 through 6.6.3-6.5.0 through 6.5.2-6.4.0 through 6.4.2Customers can upgrade to version 7.1.2 today and have these vulnerabilities plugged, or wait for upcoming versions if for whatever reason upgrading to the very latest version is unfeasible.Fortinet said it will be releasing new versions for 7.0.x, 6.7.x, 6.6.x, 6.5.x, and 6.4.x soon, without specifying an expected date. ®Updated to add on February 7 2023* The vendor has since claimed in a quote to another tech outlet that the CVEs were indeed duplicated from last October, and claimed it ""issued duplicate CVEs in error.""Updated to add on February 9 2023* The company later backtracked saying that yes, actually, these are two new vulnerabilities – two bypasses for October's CVE-2023-34992.

Chinese Hackers Exploited FortiGate Flaw to Breach Dutch Military Network,"Chinese state-backed hackers broke into a computer network that's used by the Dutch armed forces by targeting Fortinet FortiGate devices.""This [computer network] was used for unclassified research and development (R&D),"" the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) said in a statement. ""Because this system was self-contained, it did not lead to any damage to the defense network."" The network had less than 50 users.The intrusion, which took place in 2023, leveraged a known critical security flaw in FortiOS SSL-VPN (CVE-2022-42475, CVSS score: 9.3) that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted requests.Successful exploitation of the flaw paved the way for the deployment of a backdoor dubbed COATHANGER from an actor-controlled server that's designed to grant persistent remote access to the compromised appliances.""The COATHANGER malware is stealthy and persistent,"" the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said. ""It hides itself by hooking system calls that could reveal its presence. It survives reboots and firmware upgrades.""COATHANGER is distinct from BOLDMOVE, another backdoor linked to a suspected China-based threat actor that's known to have exploited CVE-2022-42475 as a zero-day in attacks targeting a European government entity and a managed service provider (MSP) located in Africa as early as October 2022.The development marks the first time the Netherlands has publicly attributed a cyber espionage campaign to China. Reuters, which broke the story, said the malware is named after a code snippet that contained a line from Lamb to the Slaughter, a short story by British author Roald Dahl.It also arrives days after U.S. authorities took steps to dismantle a botnet comprising out-of-date Cisco and NETGEAR routers that were used by Chinese threat actors like Volt Typhoon to conceal the origins of malicious traffic.Last year, Google-owned Mandiant revealed that a China-nexus cyber espionage group tracked as UNC3886 exploited zero-days in Fortinet appliances to deploy THINCRUST and CASTLETAP implants for executing arbitrary commands received from a remote server and exfiltrating sensitive data.",data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,TRUE
Why Are Compromised Identities the Nightmare to IR Speed and Efficiency?,"Incident response (IR) is a race against time. You engage your internal or external team because there's enough evidence that something bad is happening, but you're still blind to the scope, the impact, and the root cause. The common set of IR tools and practices provides IR teams with the ability to discover malicious files and outbound network connections. However, the identity aspect - namely the pinpointing of compromised user accounts that were used to spread in your network - unfortunately remains unattended. This task proves to be the most time-consuming for IR teams and has become a challenging uphill battle that enables attackers to earn precious time in which they can still inflict damage.In this article, we analyze the root cause of the identity of IR blind spots and provide sample IR scenarios in which it acts as an inhibitor to a rapid and efficient process. We then introduce Silverfort's Unified Identity Protection Platform and show how its real-time MFA and identity segmentation can overcome this blind spot and make the difference between a contained incident and a costly breach.IR 101: Knowledge is Power. Time is EverythingThe triggering of an IR process can come in a million shapes. They all share a resemblance in that you think – or are even sure – that something is wrong, but you don't know exactly what, where, and how. If you're lucky, your team spotted the threat when it's still building up its power inside but hasn't yet executed its malicious objective. If you're not so lucky, you become aware of the adversarial presence only after its impact has already broken out – encrypted machines, missing data, and any other form of malicious activity.That way or the other, the most urgent task once the IR starts rolling is to dissolve the darkness and get clear insights into the compromised entities within your environment. Once located and validated, steps can be taken to contain the attacks by quarantining machines, blocking outbound traffic, removing malicious files, and resetting user accounts.As it happens, the last task is far from trivial when dealing with compromised user accounts and introduces a yet unaddressed challenge. Let's understand why that is.Identity IR Gap #1: No Playbook Move to Detect Compromised AccountsUnlike malware files or malicious outbound network connections, a compromised account doesn't do anything that is essentially malicious – it merely logs in to resources in the same manner a normal account would. If it's an admin account that accesses multiple workstations and servers on a daily basis – which is the case in many attacks – its lateral movement won't even seem anomalous.Want to learn more about the Silverfort platform's Incident Response capabilities? Schedule a demo today!The result is that the discovery of the compromised account takes place only after the compromised machines are located and quarantined, and even then, it entails manually checking all the accounts that are logged there. And again – when racing against time, the dependency on manual and error-prone investigation creates a critical delay.Identity IR Gap #2: No Playbook Move to Immediately Contain the Attack and Prevent Further SpreadAs in real life, there's a stage of immediate first aid that precedes full treatment. The equivalent in the IR world is to contain the attack within its current boundaries and ensure it doesn't spread further, even prior to discovering its active components. On the network level, it's done by temporarily isolating segments that potentially host malicious activity from those that are not yet compromised. At the endpoint level, it's done by quarantining machines where malware is located.Here again, the identity aspect needs to catch up. The only available containment is disabling the user account in AD or resetting its password. The first option is a no-go due to the operational disruption it introduces, especially in the case of false positives. The second option is not good either; if the suspected account is a machine-to-machine service account, resetting its password is likely to break the critical processes it manages, ending up with additional damage on top of the one the attack has caused. If the adversary has managed to compromise the identity infrastructure itself, resetting the password will be immediately addressed by shifting to another account.Identity IR Gap #3: No Playbook Move to Reduce Exposed Identity Attack Surfaces That Adversaries Target Within the AttackThe weaknesses that expose the identity attack surface to malicious credential access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement are blind spots for the posture and hygiene products in the security stack. This deprives the IR team of critical indications of compromise that could have significantly accelerated the process.Prominent examples are vulnerable authentication protocols like NTLM (or, even worse, NTLMv1), misconfigurations like accounts set with unconstrained delegation, shadow admins, stale users, and many more. Adversaries feast on these weaknesses as they make their Living Off The Land route. The inability to locate and reconfigure or protect accounts and machines that feature these weaknesses turns the IR into a cat herding, where while the analyst is busy analyzing to see if Account A is compromised, the adversaries are already leveraging compromised Account B.Bottom Line: No Tools. No Shortcuts. Just Slow and Manual Log Analysis While the Attack is in Full GearSo, that's the status quo: when the IR team needs to finally discover who the compromised user accounts are that the attacker is using to spread in your environment. This is a secret no one talks about and the true root cause as to why lateral movement attacks are so successful and hard to contain, even when the IR process is taking place.Silverfort Unified Identity Protection for IR OperationsSilverfort's Unified Identity Protection platform integrates with the identity infrastructure on-prem and in the cloud (Active Directory, Entra ID, Okta, Ping, etc.). This integration enables Silverfort to have full visibility into any authentication and access attempt, real-time access enforcement to prevent malicious access with either MFA or access block, and automated discovery and protection of service accounts.Let's see how these capabilities accelerate and optimize the identity IR process:Detection of Compromised Accounts with MFA with Zero Operational DisruptionSilverfort is the only solution that can enforce MFA protection on all AD authentication, including command line tools like PsExec and PowerShell. With this capability, a single policy that requires all user accounts to verify their identity with MFA can detect all compromised accounts in minutes.Once the policy is configured, the flow is simple:- The adversary attempts to continue its malicious access and logs into a machine with the account's compromised credentials.- The true user is prompted with MFA and denies that they have requested access to the specified resource.Goal #1 achieved: There's now evidence beyond doubt that this account is compromised.Side Note: Now that there's a validated compromised account, all we need to do is filter all the machines that this account has logged into in Silverfort's log screen.Contain the Attack with MFA and Block Access PoliciesThe MFA policy we've described above not only serves to detect which accounts are compromised but also to prevent any additional spread of the attack. This enables the IR team to freeze the adversary's foothold where it is and ensure that all the yet non-compromised resources stay intact.Protection with Operational Disruption Revisited: Zoom-in On Service AccountsSpecial attention should be given to service accounts as they are heavily abused by threat actors. These machine-to-machine accounts are not associated with a human user and cannot be subject to MFA protection.However, Silverfort automatically discovers these accounts and gains insights into their repetitive behavioral patterns. With this visibility, Silverfort enables the configuration of policies that block access whenever a service account deviates from its behavior. In that manner, all of the standard service account activity is not disrupted, while any malicious attempt to abuse it is blocked.Goal #2 achieved: Attack is contained and the IR team can rapidly move to investigationEliminating Exposed Weaknesses in the Identity Attack SurfaceSilverfort's visibility into all authentications and access attempts within the environment enables it to discover and mitigate common weaknesses that attackers take advantage of. Here are a few examples:- Setting MFA policies for all shadow admins- Setting block access policies for any NTLMv1 authentications- Discover all accounts that were configured without pre-authentication- Discover all accounts that were configured with unconstrained delegationThis attack surface reduction will usually take place during the initial' first aid' stage.Goal #3 achieved: Identity weaknesses are mitigated and cannot be used for malicious propagation.Conclusion: Gaining Identity IR Capabilities is Imperative - Are You Ready?Compromised accounts are a key component in over 80% of cyber attacks, making the risk of getting hit an almost certainty. Security stakeholders should invest in having IR tools that can address this aspect in order to ensure their ability to respond efficiently when such an attack happens.To learn more about the Silverfort platform's IR capabilities, reach out to one of our experts to schedule a quick demo.",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
FCC Enforces Stronger Rules to Protect Customers Against SIM Swapping Attacks,"The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is adopting new rules that aim to protect consumers from cell phone account scams that make it possible for malicious actors to orchestrate SIM-swapping attacks and port-out fraud.""The rules will help protect consumers from scammers who target data and personal information by covertly swapping SIM cards to a new device or porting phone numbers to a new carrier without ever gaining physical control of a consumer's phone,"" FCC said this week.While SIM swapping refers to transferring a user's account to a SIM card controlled by the scammer by convincing the victim's wireless carrier, port-out fraud occurs when the bad actor, posing as the victim, transfers their phone number from one service provider to another without their knowledge.The new rules, first proposed in July 2023, mandate wireless providers to adopt secure methods of authenticating a customer before redirecting a customer's phone number to a new device or provider.Another requirement ensures that customers are immediately notified whenever a SIM change or port-out request is made on their accounts so that they can take appropriate action to secure against such attacks.SIM swapping has emerged as a serious threat, enabling threat actors like LAPSUS$ and Scattered Spider to infiltrate corporate networks. Migrating the service to an actor-controlled device gives the attackers the ability to divert SMS-based two-factor authentication codes and take over victims' online accounts.""Because we so frequently use our phone numbers for two-factor authentication, a bad actor who takes control of a phone can also take control of financial accounts, social media accounts, the list goes on,"" FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said.""Consumers must be able to count on secure verification procedures and reliable privacy guarantees from their wireless providers. And they should be able to go about their day without fearing that someone, somewhere, might take control of their phone without a single warning sign.""The development comes as the FCC said it's also launching an inquiry to understand the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on robocalls and robotexts.""AI could improve analytics tools used to block unwanted calls and texts and restore trust in our networks,"" the agency said. ""But AI could also permit bad actors to more easily defraud consumers through calls and text messages, such as by using technology to mimic voices of public officials or other trusted sources.""",regulatory changes and compliance,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

CAMC, however, reported itself to the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, from the outset.Despite the wording of the CAMC's disclosure sounding an awful lot like ransomware, and the fact LockBit claimed the attack on its leak blog, the organization has never confirmed that the incident involved ransomware.Without verifying the data, LockBit does have 9.47 GB worth of files allegedly belonging to the CAMC available for download on its website.If ransomware was involved in the attack, the publication of files would generally suggest that the organization didn't pay whatever ransom was set by the criminals. ®",data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,TRUE
DNSSEC vulnerability puts big chunk of the internet at risk,"Just one bad packet can bring down a vulnerable DNS server thanks to DNSSEC'You don't have to do more than that to disconnect an entire network' El Reg told as patches emergeUpdated A single packet can exhaust the processing capacity of a vulnerable DNS server, effectively disabling the machine, by exploiting a 20-plus-year-old design flaw in the DNSSEC specification.That would make it trivial to take down a DNSSEC-validating DNS resolver that has yet to be patched, upsetting all the clients relying on that service and make it seem as though websites and apps were offline.The academics who found this flaw – associated with the German National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity (ATHENE) in Darmstadt – claimed DNS server software makers briefed about the vulnerability described it as ""the worst attack on DNS ever discovered.""Identified by Professor Haya Schulmann and Niklas Vogel of the Goethe University Frankfurt; Elias Heftrig of Fraunhofer SIT; and Professor Michael Waidner at the Technical University of Darmstadt and Fraunhofer SIT, the security hole has been named KeyTrap, designated CVE-2023-50387, and assigned a CVSS severity rating of 7.5 out of 10.As of December 2023, approximately 31 percent of web clients worldwide used DNSSEC-validating DNS resolvers and, like other applications relying on those systems, would feel the effects of a KeyTrap attack: With those DNS servers taken out by the flaw, clients relying on them would be unable to resolve domain and host names to IP addresses to use, resulting in a loss of connectivity.The researchers said lone DNS packets exploiting KeyTrap could stall public DNSSEC-validated DNS services, such as those provided by Google and Cloudflare, by making them do calculations that overtax server CPU cores.This disruption of DNS could not only deny people's access to content but could also interfere with other systems, including spam defenses, cryptographic defenses (PKI), and inter-domain routing security (RPKI), the researchers assert.""Exploitation of this attack would have severe consequences for any application using the Internet including unavailability of technologies such as web-browsing, e-mail, and instant messaging,"" they claimed. ""With KeyTrap, an attacker could completely disable large parts of the worldwide internet.""A non-public technical paper on the vulnerability provided to The Register, titled, ""The KeyTrap Denial-of-Service Algorithmic Complexity Attacks on DNS,"" describes how an assault would be carried out. It basically involves asking a vulnerable DNSSEC-validating DNS resolver to look up an address that causes the server to contact a malicious nameserver that sends a reply that causes the resolver to consume most or all of its own CPU resources.With KeyTrap, an attacker could completely disable large parts of the worldwide Internet""To initiate the attacks our adversary causes the victim resolver to look up a record in its malicious domain,"" the due-to-be-published paper states. ""The attacker’s nameserver responds to the DNS queries with a malicious record set (RRset), according to the specific attack vector and zone configuration.""The attack works, the paper explains, because the DNSSEC spec follows Postel’s Law: ""The nameservers should send all the available cryptographic material, and the resolvers should use any of the cryptographic material they receive until the validation is successful.""This requirement, to ensure availability, means DNSSEC-validating DNS resolvers can be forced to do a lot of work if presented with colliding key-tags and colliding keys that must be validated.""Our complexity attacks are triggered by feeding the DNS resolvers with specially crafted DNSSEC records, which are constructed in a way that exploits validation vulnerabilities in cryptographic validation logic,"" the paper explains.""When the DNS resolvers attempt to validate the DNSSEC records they receive from our nameserver, they get stalled. Our attacks are extremely stealthy, being able to stall resolvers between 170 seconds and 16 hours (depending on the resolver software) with a single DNS response packet.""- If your DNS queries LoOk liKE tHIs, it's not a ransom note, it's a security improvement- Internet's safe-keepers forced to postpone crucial DNSSEC root key signing ceremony – no, not a hacker attack, but because they can't open a safe- Is DNSSEC causing more problems than it solves?- ICANN proposes creating .INTERNAL domain to do the same job as 192.168.x.xThe ATHENE boffins said they worked with all relevant vendors and major public DNS providers to privately disclose the vulnerability so a coordinated patch release would be possible. The last patch was finished today.""We are aware of this vulnerability and rolled out a fix in coordination with the reporting researchers,"" a Google spokesperson told The Register. ""There is no evidence of exploitation and no action required by users at this time.""Network research lab NLnet Labs published a patch for its Unbound DNS software, addressing two vulnerabilities, one of which is KeyTrap. The other bug fixed, CVE-2023-50868, referred to as the NSEC3 vulnerability, also allows denial of service through CPU exhaustion.""The KeyTrap vulnerability works by using a combination of keys (also colliding keys), signatures and number of RRSETs on a malicious zone,"" NLnet Labs wrote. ""Answers from that zone can force a DNSSEC validator down a very CPU intensive and time costly validation path.""PowerDNS, meanwhile, has an update here to thwart KeyTrap exploitation.""An attacker can publish a zone that contains crafted DNSSEC related records. While validating results from queries to that zone using the RFC mandated algorithms, the Recursor’s resource usage can become so high that processing of other queries is impacted, resulting in a denial of service,"" the team wrote. ""Note that any resolver following the RFCs can be impacted, this is not a problem of this particular implementation.""The fix for CVE-2023-50387 is just one of six vulnerabilities addressed in Internet Systems Consortium's BIND 9 DNS software. The others include:- CVE-2023-4408: Parsing large DNS messages may cause excessive CPU load;- CVE-2023-5517: Querying RFC 1918 reverse zones may cause an assertion failure when ""nxdomain-redirect"" is enabled;- CVE-2023-5679: Enabling both DNS64 and serve-stale may cause an assertion failure during recursive resolution;- CVE-2023-6516: Specific recursive query patterns may lead to an out-of-memory condition;- CVE-2023-50868: Preparing an NSEC3 closest encloser proof can exhaust CPU resources.The requirements for the KeyTrap vulnerability date all the way back to 1999 from the now obsolete RFC 2535, according to the research team that identified it. And by 2012, these elements appeared in RFC 6781 and RFC 6840, the implementation requirements for DNSSEC validation.One packet suffices. You don't have to do more than that to disconnect an entire networkSince at least August 2000 – more than 23 years ago – KeyTrap has been present in the BIND 9 DNS resolver, and it surfaced seven years later in the Unbound DNS resolver.Dr Haya Shulman, a professor of computer science and one of the academics behind the KeyTrap research, told The Register in a phone interview the attack is simple and can be carried out by encoding it in a zone file.""The vulnerability is actually something that's recommended in the DNSSEC standard,"" Prof Shulman explained. ""One packet suffices. You don't have to do more than that to disconnect an entire network.""Prof Shulman said the patches that have been issued by various vendors break the standard. ""The problem is this attack is not easy to solve,"" she said. ""If we launch it against a patched resolver, we still get 100 percent CPU usage but it can still respond.""The ATHENE team observed that while the flaw remained undetected for decades, its obscurity isn't surprising because DNSSEC validation requirements are so complicated. So too is mitigating the vulnerability and completely eliminating it will require a revision of the DNSSEC standard. ®Updated to add on February 16You can now download the technical paper here as a PDF.Also, Akamai exec Sven Dummer thanked the research team for not only discovering the flaw but also working with DNS providers and software makers to coordinate the patching and redeployment of systems to avoid mass exploitation.""You might not know it, but the global internet dodged a bullet: KeyTrap is a vulnerability in key infrastructure that is needed for the internet to function — and one of the worst ever discovered,"" he opined.""With KeyTrap, an attacker could completely disable large parts of the worldwide internet.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

Ivanti VPN Flaw Exploited to Inject Novel Backdoor; Hundreds Pwned,"February 13, 2024Threat actors continue to hammer the five security vulnerabilities that have have been recently disclosed in Ivanti VPN appliances. This week, researchers said attackers are injecting a never-before-seen backdoor for persistent remote access within target networks — so far compromising 670+ IT infrastructures in a mass-exploitation campaign.Ivanti disclosed the vulnerability (a server-side request forgery vulnerability in the SAML component tracked as CVE-2024-21893) on Jan. 31, along with an additional new bug and fixes for two previously disclosed flaws. On Feb. 3, researchers at Orange Cyberdefense spotted a compromised Ivanti appliance infected with a novel backdoor, called ""DSLog"" after a legitimate logging module within the device.""This appliance had the initial XML mitigation (API endpoints blocked) in place but not yet the second mitigation (or patch),"" Cyberdefense's new advisory explained. Upon closer examination, the backdoor turned out to be ""interesting"" because it's controlled with a basic ""API key"" mechanism, the report explained. Also, it's different from previous webshells used in campaigns targeting the Ivanti bugs: 1), because the webshell does not return a status message after contact, so there is no known way to detect it directly; and 2), DSLog uses a unique hash per appliance. ""This hash cannot be used to contact the same backdoor implemented in another device,"" the firm explained.Cyberdefense cautioned in its report that the Ivanti Integrity Checker Tool isn't a completely accurate method of compromise detection, but it remains a useful tool.If cyber teams can check these boxes, their systems are probably in the clear, according to the report:your appliance was mitigated early on (around January 11th onward)no historical ICT nor external ICT scans showed signs of compromise,and no other suspicious behavior, i.e. in IOCs, logs, or alerts from security solutions was found in the rest of the infrastructure.""If these are true, then the device is probably free from compromise,"" the researchers added.This is not the first instance of threat actors, including China-backed state cyberattackers, dropping pioneering malware on unprotected Ivanti systems. The Cyberdefense report advised that any compromised Ivanti device or potential target of Chinese threat actors should conduct a factory reset with full patching. There are some Ivanti appliance versions without an available patch, the Cyberdefense team added, in which case cyber teams are advised to apply the XML mitigation as a stopgap and continue to check back for a more permanent patch.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
4 Ways Hackers use Social Engineering to Bypass MFA,"When it comes to access security, one recommendation stands out above the rest: multi-factor authentication (MFA). With passwords alone being simple work for hackers, MFA provides an essential layer of protection against breaches. However, it's important to remember that MFA isn't foolproof. It can be bypassed, and it often is.If a password is compromised, there are several options available to hackers looking to circumvent the added protection of MFA. We'll explore four social engineering tactics hackers successfully use to breach MFA and emphasize the importance of having a strong password as part of a layered defense.1. Adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) attacksAITM attacks involve deceiving users into believing they're logging into a genuine network, application, or website. But really, they're giving up their information to a fraudulent lookalike. This lets hackers intercept passwords and manipulate security measures, including MFA prompts. For instance, a spear-phishing email may arrive in an employee's inbox, posing as a trusted source. Clicking on the embedded link directs them to a counterfeit website where hackers collect their login credentials.While MFA should ideally prevent these attacks by requiring an additional authentication factor, hackers can employ a technique known as '2FA pass-on.' Once the victim enters their credentials on the fake site, the attacker promptly enters the same details on the legitimate site. This triggers a legitimate MFA request, which the victim anticipates and readily approves, unwittingly granting the attacker complete access.This is a common tactic for threat groups such as Storm-1167, who are known for crafting fake Microsoft authentication pages to harvest credentials. They also create a second phishing page that mimics the MFA step of the Microsoft login process, prompting the victim to put in their MFA code and grant the attackers access. From there, they gain access to a legitimate email account and can use it as a platform for a multi-stage phishing attack.2. MFA prompt bombingThis tactic takes advantage of the push notification feature in modern authentication apps. After compromising a password, attackers attempt to login which sends an MFA prompt to the legitimate user's device. They rely on the user either mistaking it for a genuine prompt and accepting it or becoming frustrated with continuous prompts and accepting one to stop the notifications. This technique, known as MFA prompt bombing, poses a significant threat.In a notable incident, hackers from the 0ktapus group compromised an Uber contractor's login credentials through SMS phishing, then continued with the authentication process from a machine they controlled and immediately requested a multi-factor authentication (MFA) code. They then impersonated an Uber security team member on Slack, convincing the contractor to accept the MFA push notification on their phone.3. Service desk attacksAttackers deceive helpdesks into bypassing MFA by feigning password forgetfulness and gaining access through phone calls. If service desk agents fail to enforce proper verification procedures, they may unknowingly grant hackers an initial entry point into their organization's environment. A recent example was the MGM Resorts attack, where the Scattered Spider hacker group fraudulently contacted the service desk for a password reset, giving them a foothold to log in and launch a ransomware attack.Hackers also try to exploit recovery settings and back-up procedures by manipulating service desks to circumvent MFA. 0ktapus have been known to resort to targeting an organization's service desk if their MFA prompt bombing proves unsuccessful. They'll contact service desks claiming their phone is inoperable or lost, then request to enroll in a new, attacker-controlled MFA authentication device. They can then exploit the organization's recovery or backup process by getting a password reset link sent to the compromised device. Concerned about service desk security gaps? Learn how to secure yours.4. SIM swappingCybercriminals understand MFA often relies on cell phones as a means of authentication. They can exploit this with a technique called a 'SIM swap', where hackers deceive service providers into transferring a target's services to a SIM card under their control. They can then effectively take over the target's cell service and phone number, letting them intercept MFA prompts and gain unauthorized access to accounts.After an incident in 2022, Microsoft published a report detailing the tactics employed by the threat group LAPSUS$. The report explained how LAPSUS$ dedicates extensive social engineering campaigns to gaining initial footholds in target organizations. One of their favored techniques is targeting users with SIM-swapping attacks, along with MFA prompt bombing, and resetting a target's credentials through help desk social engineering.You can't fully rely on MFA – password security still mattersThis wasn't an exclusive list of ways to bypass MFA. There are several others ways too, including compromising endpoints, exporting generated tokens, exploiting SSO, and finding unpatched technical deficiencies. It's clear that setting up MFA doesn't mean organizations can forget about securing passwords altogether.Account compromise still often starts with weak or compromised passwords. Once an attacker obtains a valid password, they can then shift their focus towards bypassing the MFA mechanism. Even a strong password can't protect users if it's been compromised through a breach or password reuse. And for most organizations, going fully passwordless won't be a practical option.With a tool like Specops Password Policy, you can enforce robust Active Directory password policies to eliminate weak passwords and continuously scan for compromised passwords resulting from breaches, password reuse, or being sold after a phishing attack. This ensures that MFA serves as an additional layer of security as intended, rather than being solely relied upon as a silver-bullet solution.

"U.S. DoJ Dismantles Warzone RAT Infrastructure, Arrests Key Operators","The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Friday announced the seizure of online infrastructure that was used to sell a remote access trojan (RAT) called Warzone RAT.Alongside the takedown, the international law enforcement effort has arrested and indicted two individuals in Malta and Nigeria for their involvement in selling and supporting the malware and helping other cybercriminals use the RAT for malicious purposes.The defendants, Daniel Meli (27) and Prince Onyeoziri Odinakachi (31) have been charged with unauthorized damage to protected computers, with the former also accused of ""illegally selling and advertising an electronic interception device and participating in a conspiracy to commit several computer intrusion offenses.""Meli is alleged to have offered malware services at least since 2012 through online hacking forums, sharing e-books, and helping other criminals use RATs to carry out cyber attacks. Prior to Warzone RAT, he had sold another RAT known as Pegasus RAT (not to be confused with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware).Like Meli, Odinakachi also provided online customer support to purchasers of Warzone RAT malware between June 2019 and no earlier than March 2023. Both individuals were arrested on February 7, 2024.Warzone RAT, also known as Ave Maria, was first documented by Yoroi in January 2019 as part of a cyber attack targeting an Italian organization in the oil and gas sector towards the end of 2018 using phishing emails bearing bogus Microsoft Excel files exploiting a known security flaw in the Equation Editor (CVE-2017-11882).Sold under the malware-as-a-service (Maas) model for $38 a month (or $196 for a year), it functions as an information stealer and facilitates remote control, thereby allowing threat actors to commandeer the infected hosts for follow-on exploitation.Some of the notable features of the malware include the ability to browse victim file systems, take screenshots, record keystrokes, steal victim usernames and passwords, and activate the computer's webcams without the victim's knowledge or consent.""Ave Maria attacks are initiated via phishing emails, once the dropped payload infects the victim's machine with the malware, it establishes communication with the attacker's command-and-control (C2) server on non-HTTP protocol, after decrypting its C2 connection using RC4 algorithm,"" Zscaler ThreatLabz said in early 2023.On one of the now-dismantled websites, which had the tagline ""Serving you loyally since 2018,"" the developers of the C/C++ malware described it as reliable and easy to use. They also provided the ability for customers to contact them via email (solmyr@warzone[.]ws), Telegram (@solwz and @sammysamwarzone), Skype (vuln.hf), as well as via a dedicated ""client area.""An additional contact avenue was Discord, where the users were asked to get in touch with an account with the ID Meli#4472. Another Telegram account linked to Meli was @daniel96420.The DoJ said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) covertly purchased copies of Warzone RAT and confirmed its nefarious functions.

"Rhysida Ransomware Cracked, Free Decryption Tool Released","Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered an ""implementation vulnerability"" that has made it possible to reconstruct encryption keys and decrypt data locked by Rhysida ransomware.The findings were published last week by a group of researchers from Kookmin University and the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA).""Through a comprehensive analysis of Rhysida Ransomware, we identified an implementation vulnerability, enabling us to regenerate the encryption key used by the malware,"" the researchers said.The development marks the first successful decryption of the ransomware strain, which first made its appearance in May 2023. A recovery tool is being distributed through KISA.Rhysida, which is known to share overlaps with another ransomware crew called Vice Society, leverages a tactic known as double extortion to apply pressure on victims into paying up by threatening to release their stolen data.An advisory published by the U.S. government in November 2023 called out the threat actors for staging opportunistic attacks targeting education, manufacturing, information technology, and government sectors.A thorough examination of the ransomware's inner workings has revealed its use of LibTomCrypt for encryption as well as parallel processing to speed up the process. It has also been found to implement intermittent encryption (aka partial encryption) to evade detection by security solutions.""Rhysida ransomware uses a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the encryption key,"" the researchers said. ""This generator uses a cryptographically secure algorithm to generate random numbers.""The predictability of the random number notwithstanding, the main process of Rhysida ransomware compiles a list of files to be encrypted, which is subsequently referenced by various threads created to simultaneously encrypt the files in a specific order.""In the encryption process of the Rhysida ransomware, the encryption thread generates 80 bytes of random numbers when encrypting a single file,"" the researchers noted. ""Of these, the first 48 bytes are used as the encryption key and the [initialization vector].""Using these observations as reference points, the researchers said they were able to retrieve the initial seed for decrypting the ransomware, determine the ""randomized"" order in which the files were encrypted, and ultimately recover the data without having to pay a ransom.""Although these studies have a limited scope, it is important to acknowledge that certain ransomwares [...] can be successfully decrypted,"" the researchers concluded.UpdateFollowing the publication of the story, security researcher Fabian Wosar said that the weaknesses were found by ""at least three other parties, who chose to circulate it in private instead of seeking publication and alerting Rhysida about their problem.""""Avast found it in October last year, the French CERT authored and published a private paper about it in June, and I found the vulnerability in May last year,"" Wosar said. ""I don't know about the Avast and CERT data, but we [have] decrypted hundreds of systems since then.""""Also, a word of caution: The paper only applies to the Windows PE version of the Rhysida ransomware.

"Phishers pwn hundreds of users, dozens of Azure environments","Crooks hook hundreds of exec accounts after phishing in Azure C-suite pondPlenty of successful attacks observed with dangerous follow-on activityThe number of senior business executives stymied by an ongoing phishing campaign continues to rise with cybercriminals registering hundreds of cloud account takeovers (ATOs) since spinning it up in November.Researchers from Proofpoint listed many C-suite roles as prime targets for the unnamed attackers, as well as other senior positions such as VPs, sales directors, and finance managers. The customers caught out by the scam were not listed.The overarching goal, as with all these types of assaults, is to gain access to as many privileged accounts as possible and tap into all the resources available for follow-on crimes.Naturally, this meant the criminals stole data in some cases, including sensitive files containing financial assets, internal security protocols, and user credentials.A specific Linux user-agent was identified as one of the most notable indicators of compromise (IoCs), mainly using it to access the ""OfficeHome"" sign-in application: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36.The same user-agent was used to access a number of other Microsoft 365 apps too:-Office 365 Shell WCSS-Client: Indicates a browser was used to access Office 365 apps-Office 365 Exchange Online: Suggests mailboxes were abused and data may have been stolen-My Signins: Indicates attempts made to manipulate MFA methods-My Apps-My ProfileProofpoint hasn't officially attributed the attacks to a specific group, but some evidence points to them being possibly based in Russia and Nigeria.Other post-intrusion activities include attackers manipulating MFA to establish persistent access to systems after making the initial compromise. The attackers were spotted implementing their own MFA methods – an authenticator app is the preferred choice, it seems – but other techniques such as registering different phone numbers were also observed.Armed with full control of a legitimate business email account, the crims went on to launch internal and external phishing campaigns using the new identity. A legitimate account, in theory, adds a greater sense of authenticity to an email and is less likely to trigger spam filters, potentially offering a greater chance of success.Email access was also abused to scan for secrets and perform lateral movement across the target organization, in addition to the numerous financial fraud attempts made by sending personalized messages targeting HR and finance departments.Attackers would also add their own mailbox rules designed to mask their malicious activity.While the phishing campaign remains ongoing, the researcher advised users to remain wary of all unexpected emails and exercise extreme caution when opening links – the usual stuff.The sample phishing emails seen by researchers are said to be individualized to their target, directing them to what appears to be a shared document but the link instead redirects to a malicious phishing page.As security conscious Reg readers know only too well, being sent a link to a document from an unknown sender should immediately be a red flag for any user, even if it is personalized to the target, but the campaign's success rate shows that phishing attempts don't need to be especially sophisticated to achieve their goals.- Jet engine dealer to major airlines discloses 'unauthorized activity'- Europe's largest caravan club admits wide array of personal data potentially accessed- Ivanti discloses fifth vulnerability, doesn't credit researchers who found it- Fortinet's week to forget: Critical vulns, disclosure screw-ups, and that toothbrush DDoS attack claimLooking at the campaign's infrastructure, the attackers use proxy services set up close to their targets to evade geofencing policies and also local fixed-line internet service providers (ISPs). Examples of the non-proxy sources were from Russia-based Selena Telecom LLC, and Nigerian providers Airtel Networks Limited and MTN Nigeria Communication Limited.As for locking down systems, the usual advice applies here: monitoring logs for IoCs, enforcing credential changes for compromised users, ensuring security products are configured correctly to detect ATOs, and implementing auto-remediation policies. ®",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

Akto Launches Proactive GenAI Security Testing Solution,"February 13, 2024PRESS RELEASESan Francisco, CA – Feb 13, 2024About 77% of organizations have adopted or are exploring AI in some capacity, pushing for a more efficient and automated workflow. With the increasing reliance on GenAI models and Language Learning Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, the need for robust security measures have become paramount.Akto, a leading API Security company, is proud to announce the launch of its revolutionary GenAI Security Testing solution. This cutting-edge technology marks a significant milestone in the field of AI security, making Akto the world's first proactive GenAI security testing platform.“Akto has a new capability to scan APIs that leverage AI technology and this is fundamental for the future of application security. I invested early in building application, security education for AI and I’m thrilled to see other security companies do the same for security assessment around AI technologies.” - Jim Manico, Former OWASP Global Board Member, Secure Coding Educator.On average, an organization uses 10 GenAI models. Often most LLMs in production will receive data indirectly via APIs. That means tons and tons of sensitive data is being processed by the LLM APIs. Ensuring the security of these APIs will be very crucial to protect user privacy and prevent data leaks. There are several ways in which LLMs can be abused today, leading to sensitive data leaks.Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities - The risk of unauthorized prompt injections, where malicious inputs can manipulate the LLM’s output, has become a major concern.Denial of Service (DoS) Threats - LLMs are also susceptible to DoS attacks, where the system is overloaded with requests, leading to service disruptions. There's been a rise in reported DoS incidents targeting LLM APIs in the last year.Overreliance on LLM Outputs - Overreliance on LLMs without adequate verification mechanisms has led to cases of data inaccuracies and leaks. Organizations are encouraged to implement robust validation processes, as the industry sees an increase in data leak incidents due to overreliance on LLMs.“Securing GenAI systems requires a multifaceted approach with the need to protect not only the AI from external inputs but also external systems that depend on their outputs. “ - OWASP Top 10 for LLM AI Applications Core team member.On March 20, 2023, there was an outage with OpenAI's AI tool, ChatGPT. The outage was caused by a vulnerability in an open-source library, which may have exposed payment-related information of some customers. Very recently, on January 25, 2024, a critical vulnerability was discovered in Anything LLM ( 8,000 Github Stars) that turns any document or piece of content into context that any LLM can use during chatting. An unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attackers to crash the server resulting in a denial of service attack. These are only a few examples of security incidents related to using LLM models.Akto's GenAI Security Testing solution addresses these challenges head-on. By leveraging advanced testing methodologies and state-of-the-art algorithms, Akto provides comprehensive security assessments for GenAI models, including LLMs. The solution incorporates a wide range of innovative features, including over 60 meticulously designed test cases that cover various aspects of GenAI vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, overreliance on specific data sources, and more. These test cases have been developed by Akto's team of experts in GenAI security, ensuring the highest level of protection for organizations deploying GenAI models.Akto, a company based in San Francisco, is a leading API Security company that specializes in providing cutting-edge solutions to protect APIs from security vulnerabilities. With a team of experts in AI security and a passion for innovation, Akto is committed to enabling organizations to secure their applications from attacks and ensure secure use of GenAI APIs. Learn more about Akto here.Currently, security teams manually test all the LLM APIs for flaws before release. Due to the time sensitivity of product releases, teams can only test for a few vulnerabilities. As hackers continue to find more creative ways to exploit LLMs, security teams need to find an automated way to secure LLMs at scale.“Often input to an LLM comes from an end-user or the output is shown to the end-user or both. The tests try to exploit LLM vulnerabilities through different encoding methods, separators and markers. This specially detects weak security practices where developers encode the input or put special markers around the input. “ - Ankush Jain, CTO at Akto.ioAI security testing also detects weak security measures against sanitizing output of LLMs. It aims to detect attempts to inject malicious code for remote execution, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other attacks that could allow attackers to extract session tokens and system information. In addition, Akto also tests whether the LLMs are susceptible to generating false or irrelevant reports.“From Prompt Injection ( LLM:01) to Overreliance (LLM09) and new vulnerabilities and breaches everyday and build systems that are secure by default; It is critical to test systems early for these ever evolving threats. I’m excited to see what Akto has in store for my LLM projects” - OWASP Top 10 for LLM AI Applications Core team member.To further emphasize the importance of GenAI security, a recent survey in September, 2023 by Gartner revealed that 34% of organizations are either already using or implementing artificial intelligence (AI) application security tools to mitigate the accompanying risks of generative AI (GenAI). Over half (56%) of respondents said they are also exploring such solutions, highlighting the critical need for robust security testing solutions like Akto's.To showcase the capabilities and significance of Akto's GenAI Security Testing solution, Akto’s Founder and CEO Ankita will be presenting at the prestigious Austin API Summit 2024. The session, titled ""Security of LLM APIs,"" will delve into the problem statement, highlight real-world examples, and demonstrate how solutions like Akto’s provide a robust defense against AI-related vulnerabilities.As organizations strive to harness the power of AI, Akto stands at the forefront of ensuring the security and integrity of these transformative technologies. The launch of their GenAI Security Testing solution reinforces their commitment to innovation and their dedication to enabling organizations to embrace GenAI with confidence.About AktoAkto, a company based in San Francisco, is a leading API Security company that specializes in providing cutting-edge solutions to protect APIs from security vulnerabilities.

Free Rhysida ransomware recovery tool published,"Korean eggheads crack Rhysida ransomware and release free decryptor toolGreat news for victims of gang behind the big British Library hit in OctoberSome smart folks have found a way to automatically unscramble documents encrypted by the Rhysida ransomware, and used that know-how to produce and release a handy recovery tool for victims.Rhysida is a newish ransomware gang that has been around since May last year.The extortion crew targets organizations in education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government; the crooks' most high-profile attack to date has been against the British Library. The gang is thought to be linked to the Vice Society criminal group, and it's known to lease out malware and infrastructure to affiliates for a cut of the proceeds.In research [PDF] published February 9, South Korea's Giyoon Kim, Soojin Kang, Seungjun Baek, Kimoon Kim, and Jongsung Kim explained how they uncovered an ""implementation vulnerability"" in the random number generator used by Rhysida to lock up victims' data.This flaw ""enabled us to regenerate the internal state of the random number generator at the time of infection,"" and then decrypt the data, ""using the regenerated random number generator,"" the team wrote. The Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA) is now distributing the free Rhysida ransomware recovery tool which is the first successful decryptor of this particular strain of ransomware.""We aspire for our work to contribute to mitigating the damage inflicted by the Rhysida ransomware,"" the boffins, based variously at Kookmin University and KISA, noted in their paper.- British Library: Finances remain healthy as ransomware recovery continues- New kids on the ransomware block in 2023: Akira and 8Base lead dozens of newbies- And that's a wrap for Babuk Tortilla ransomware as free decryptor released- Meet VexTrio, a network of 70K hijacked websites crooks use to sling malware, fraudThe random number output by the CSPRNG is based on the ransomware's time of execution – a method the researchers realized limits the possible combinations for each encryption key. Specifically, the malware use the current time-of-execution as a 32-bit seed for the generator. That means the keys can be derived from the time of execution, and used to decrypt and recover scrambled files.Some additional observations: the Rhysida ransomware uses intermittent encryption. It partially encrypts documents rather than entire files, a technique made popular by LockBit and other gangs because it's faster than encrypting everything. This approach means the criminals are less likely to be caught on the network before they've finished messing up a decent number of documents. It also speeds up the restoration process, though the usual caveats apply: Don't trust machines that have had intruders code running on them. Restoring data is one thing, but the PCs will need wiping to be safe.The Rhysida malware, once on a victim's Windows PC, locates the documents it wishes to scramble, compiles them into a list, and fires up some simultaneous threads to perform that encryption. Each thread picks the next file on its todo pile to process, and uses the CSPRNG to generate a key to encrypt that document using the standard AES-256 algorithm. The key is stored in the scrambled file albeit encrypted using a hardcoded RSA public key.

Dutch insurers still requiring nudes from cancer patients,"Dutch insurers demand nudes from breast cancer patients despite banNo photos? No, second operationUpdated Dutch health insurers are reportedly forcing breast cancer patients to submit photos of their breasts prior to reconstructive surgery despite a government ban on precisely that.That sounds pretty bad but it gets worse: These insurers keep losing their copies of these highly intimate pictures, one way or another.Some insurers don't use secure websites and/or other means of electronic communications to transfer these very sensitive photos, according to the Netherlands public broadcaster NOS. Patients reported that their insurance companies have lost their photos, and denied their requests for reconstructive surgeries following a breast-cancer diagnosis.In addition to being intrusive and humiliating — and, we're told, not a requirement for any other types of cancer-related surgeries — cancer patients' photos have been stolen by ransomware crews in the past, and then used to extort victims. Some of these images ended up published online in data dumps, and now patients are suing the healthcare provider for allowing the ""preventable"" and ""seriously damaging"" leak.While the initial reconstruction is reimbursed by health insurers, if the patients require a follow-up surgery insurers generally require photos to determine whether they will cover it.After a media outcry about the situation in 2021 the Dutch Health Minister required that these photos be taken in a hospital, with the rules coming into effect on January 1, 2023. Some hospitals have since refused to do this, citing the sensitive nature of the images and potential privacy nightmares.Meanwhile, health insurance orgs aren't necessarily following this rule, and are still asking patients directly for photos. One patient interviewed by NOS and insured by CZ was asked to send the nudes via email before the insurer would reimburse a second procedure after a botched first operation.So she did, ""with great reluctance,"" and was later told by CZ that the photos had been lost.- Cancer patient sues hospital after ransomware gang leaks her nude medical photos- Now BlackCat extortionists threaten to leak stolen plastic surgery pics- After injecting cancer hospital with ransomware, crims threaten to swat patients- Ignore Uncle Sam's 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your perilWhen asked about the patients' claims, a CZ spokesperson told The Register: ""Dutch health insurer CZ does not ask breast cancer patients to submit photos.""The insurer, however, told NOS that it does request photos from the patients ""if the plastic surgeon doesn't want to send photos,"" and described the lost pic as ""very annoying.""Other patients, including those insured by health corporation VGZ, also reported being asked to to submit images of their breasts and then losing them. One reported being told to send the images via unsecured email and an employee telling her they had been passed ""from one counter to another.""That insurance group told NOS that ""only in the event of a complaint can policyholders be asked for photos.""The Register could not reach VGZ for comment, and the Health Minister did not immediately respond to our questions including if the agency planned to take action. ®Updated to add on February 13The trade body for Dutch health insurers, Zorgverzekeraars Nederland (Health Insurers Netherlands), has now changed its policy, and patients will no longer have to submit photos to insurers to get approval for follow-up breast cancer operations.

Glupteba Botnet Adds UEFI Bootkit to Cyberattack Toolbox,"February 13, 2024The widespread, multitooled Glupteba malware has adopted a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) bootkit, allowing it to stealthily persist inside of Windows systems despite reboots, by manipulating the process by which the operating system is loaded.Glupteba is a malware behemoth: a combination backdoor-infostealer-loader-cryptominer-malvertiser-botnet, built modularly to allow even more components to be added at will by its operators. Among its many capabilities are some extra-special features, too, such as using the Bitcoin blockchain as a backup command-and-control (C2) system, and being able to hide itself with Windows kernel drivers.Its latest shiny feature is an upgrade on that last bit. In a campaign observed by Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 last November, Glupteba came fitted with an incisive bootloader implant, ensuring that it can start running on infected Windows machines even before Windows itself does.The New BootloaderIn years prior, Glupteba achieved serious levels of persistence and evasion by manipulating Windows drivers. It would drop a known vulnerable driver, then use open source tools like DSEFix or UPGDSED to override Windows' requirement that drivers be validated by digital signatures.Now the botnet has incorporated a new open source tool called EfiGuard, which achieves even more sophisticated, lower-level access by taking advantage of UEFI, a specification which replaced the basic input/output system (BIOS), used to connect a machine's firmware to its operating system.In short, the bootkit contains an implant for the EFI system partition (ESP) — located in a machine's boot device and containing the Windows Boot Manager — which disables driver signature enforcement as well as PatchGuard, the Windows function that prevents changes to the kernel. It allows Glupteba to operate in this privileged space, executing its code before Windows is able to start up in the first place, making the job of detecting and removing it far more difficult for affected organizations.Only a few such bootkits have ever been discovered in the wild before.""The UEFI bootloader of Glupteba poses serious threats to targeted organizations and can potentially lead to persistent infection, unauthorized access, control over firmware, data loss, and operational disruptions,"" warns Lior Rochberger, cortex threat researcher at Palo Alto Networks. ""Those risks become more challenging and serious, especially since once the bootkit is installed it is very hard to discover and remediate. In the worst case scenario, the operators might even manipulate the hardware component and cause long-term damage to the infected machines.""As Palo Alto noted in its report, any given scenario — depending on the architecture, OS version, and configuration of a targeted machine — might call for DSEFix, UPGDSED, or EfiGuard. However, none of the three appear to bypass Windows' Secure Boot feature, like BlackLotus can.Glupteba's Remarkable Longevity & SpreadBesides being one of the most powerful, Glupteba is also one of the world's longest-standing examples of malware out there.Beginning as a simple backdoor in the early 2010s, it gradually evolved into a multipronged botnet able to steal credit card data and credentials from various software, perform digital ad fraud, hijack and mine cryptocurrencies, gain remote admin access on routers, and download additional payloads with more features therein.It can be no wonder, then, that by the following decade it already had more than a million Windows devices under its spell, with thousands more added every day. Glupteba got so big that, powerless to stop it by conventional means, it inspired litigation from Google.Google's efforts helped disrupt Glupteba until it roared back in December 2022. Rochberger attributes its revival to the pay-per-install (PPI) market, in which Dark Web traffickers charge operators of malware such as Glupteba a certain number of infections worldwide in exchange for flat-rate payments.""The industries affected were diverse, since distribution follows more of an approach of spreading as much as possible, not to specific targets,"" she explains. The same goes for geographic regions: Glupteba's 2023 campaign spread across countries as diverse as Greece and Nepal, Bangladesh, Brazil, Korea, Algeria, Ukraine, Slovakia, Turkey, Italy, and Sweden.For organizations already affected, as well as those more lucky, Rochberger recommends proactivity and diligence.""The most important thing is to keep good security hygiene and good security posture — using the most up-to-date security products and applying a multilayered approach that enables organizations to not only detect,"" she says, ""but also to prevent these kinds of sophisticated threats that constantly evolve.""About the Author(s)You May Also Like",emerging threats and attack techniques,news and industry updates,FALSE
Glupteba Botnet Evades Detection with Undocumented UEFI Bootkit,"The Glupteba botnet has been found to incorporate a previously undocumented Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) bootkit feature, adding another layer of sophistication and stealth to the malware.""This bootkit can intervene and control the [operating system] boot process, enabling Glupteba to hide itself and create a stealthy persistence that can be extremely difficult to detect and remove,"" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers Lior Rochberger and Dan Yashnik said in a Monday analysis.Glupteba is a fully-featured information stealer and backdoor capable of facilitating illicit cryptocurrency mining and deploying proxy components on infected hosts. It's also known to leverage the Bitcoin blockchain as a backup command-and-control (C2) system, making it resilient to takedown efforts.Some of the other functions allow it to deliver additional payloads, siphon credentials, and credit card data, perform ad fraud, and even exploit routers to gain credentials and remote administrative access.Over the past decade, the modular malware has metamorphosed into a sophisticated threat employing elaborate multi-stage infection chains to sidestep detection by security solutions.A November 2023 campaign observed by the cybersecurity firm entails the use of pay-per-install (PPI) services such as Ruzki to distribute Glupteba. In September 2022, Sekoia linked Ruzki to activity clusters leveraging PrivateLoader as a conduit to propagate next-stage malware.This takes the form of large-scale phishing attacks in which PrivateLoader is delivered under the guise of installation files for cracked software, which then loads SmokeLoader that, in turn, launches RedLine Stealer and Amadey, with the latter ultimately dropping Glupteba.""Threat actors often distribute Glupteba as part of a complex infection chain spreading several malware families at the same time,"" the researchers explained. ""This infection chain often starts with a PrivateLoader or SmokeLoader infection that loads other malware families, then loads Glupteba.""In a sign that the malware is being actively maintained, Glupteba comes fitted with a UEFI bootkit by incorporating a modified version of an open-source project called EfiGuard, which is capable of disabling PatchGuard and Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) at boot time.It's worth pointing out that previous versions of the malware were found to ""install a kernel driver the bot uses as a rootkit, and make other changes that weaken the security posture of an infected host.""Glupteba's resurfaced campaign in 2023 has been described as widespread and affecting multiple regions and industries spread across countries as varied as Greece, Nepal, Bangladesh, Brazil, Korea, Algeria, Ukraine, Slovakia, Turkey, Italy, and Sweden.""Glupteba malware continues to stand out as a notable example of the complexity and adaptability exhibited by modern cybercriminals,"" the researchers said.""The identification of an undocumented UEFI bypass technique within Glupteba underscores this malware's capacity for innovation and evasion. Furthermore, with its role in distributing Glupteba, the PPI ecosystem highlights the collaboration and monetization strategies employed by cybercriminals in their attempts at mass infections.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
"Urgent patches available for QNAP vulnerabilities, one 0-day","QNAP vulnerability disclosure ends up an utter shamblesTwo new flaws, one zero-day, countless different patches, but everything's fine!Network-attached storage (NAS) specialist QNAP has disclosed and released fixes for two new vulnerabilities, one of them a zero-day discovered in early November.The Taiwanese company's coordinated disclosure of the issues with researchers at Unit 42 by Palo Alto Networks has, however, led to some confusion over the severity of the security problem.QNAP assigned CVE-2023-50358 a middling 5.8-out-of-10 severity score, the breakdown of which revealed it was classified as a high-complexity attack that would have a low impact if exploited successfully.Unit 42's assessment, on the other hand, was the polar opposite: ""These remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting IoT devices exhibit a combination of low attack complexity and critical impact, making them an irresistible target for threat actors. As a result, protecting IoT devices against such threats is an urgent task.""The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) also released an emergency alert today warning that successful exploits could lead to ""major damage,"" encouraging users to apply patches quickly.At the time of writing, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is still working to assign the vulnerability an independent rating.Typically, command injection vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit tend to attract severity scores at the higher end of the scale, so it will be interesting to see what the NVD's score ends up being.According to Unit42's internet scans of vulnerable devices carried out in mid-January, 289,665 separate IP addresses registered a vulnerable, public-facing device.Germany and the US were the most exposed, with 42,535 and 36,865 vulnerable devices respectively, while China, Italy, Japan, Taiwan, and France trailed each with over 10,000 devices exposed.Exploiting CVE-2023-50358Unlike QNAP, Unit 42 published a technical breakdown of CVE-2023-50358 and how to exploit the vulnerability.It's classed as a command injection flaw in the quick.cgi component of QNAP's QTS firmware, which runs on most of its NAS devices.""While setting the HTTP request parameter todo=set_timeinfo, the request handler in quick.cgi saves the value of the parameter SPECIFIC_SERVER into a configuration file /tmp/quick/quick_tmp.conf with the entry name NTP Address,"" the researchers explained.""After writing the NTP server address, the component starts time synchronization using the ntpdate utility. The command-line execution is built by reading the NTP Address in quick_tmp.conf, and this string is then executed using system().""Untrusted data from the SPECIFIC_SERVER parameter is therefore used to build a command line to be executed in the shell resulting in arbitrary command execution.""Double upQNAP's advisory also detailed fixes for a second command injection flaw, CVE-2023-47218, which was reported by Stephen Fewer, principal security researcher at Rapid7, and has also been given the same 5.8 severity score.The advisory itself combines both vulnerabilities and provides technical details for neither, so it's difficult to determine what the differences are from this alone.Rapid7's advisory, however, provides extensive detail on how CVE-2023-47218 also lies in the quick.cgi component, allowing for command injection, and how it can feasibly be exploited using a specially crafted HTTP POST request.Details of the disclosure timeline also offered a glimpse at what appears to be a slightly ticked-off Rapid7 after QNAP went silent and published its patches earlier than agreed.After agreeing to a coordinated disclosure date for the vulnerabilities of February 7 back in December, on January 25 QNAP told Rapid7 it had already pushed out the patches.

33m French citizens data stolen in healthcare billing breach,"Mon Dieu!

Affected data on customers and their families includes dates of birth, marital status, social security numbers and insurance information. No banking info, medical data or contact information was compromised, the CNIL added.""This is the first time that there has been a violation of this magnitude [in France],"" Yann Padova, digital data protection lawyer and former secretary general of the CNIL told French radio network Franceinfo. Padova believes the breach is the largest in France's history.Viamedis was reportedly compromised through a phishing attack that targeted healthcare professionals, and used credentials stolen from such professionals to gain access to its systems. Almerys didn't disclose how its compromise occurred, but it's possible the ingress was similar in nature – it admitted the attacker gained access through a portal used by healthcare providers.The CNIL said that it's working with Viamedis and Almerys to ensure those affected are informed – as is required under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation – but it'll likely take some time to get the word out to nearly half the country.In the meantime, French officials are warning that the stolen data could be combined with data from other breaches to be used in phishing attacks or social engineering schemes. An investigation has been opened, the CNIL said, to determine whether either organization is at fault for the breach.Juniper reportedly leaks customer infoNetworking biz Juniper reportedly leaked information about the devices its customers owned, according to a Krebs on Security report.The source of the leak was Juniper's support portal, which was apparently found by a 17-year-old intern to allow searches on the name of any customer – and then to produce a list of devices they had acquired and registered with Juniper.Juniper has fixed the flaw, which appears to stem from improper configuration of the Salesforce SaaS it uses to power its support site.– Simon SharwoodCritical vulnerabilities of the weekCisco is warning of some serious cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities in its Expressway Series devices that could give an attacker the ability to perform arbitrary actions on compromised devices.There are three CVEs to be concerned with: CVE-2024-20252, CVE-2024-20254 and CVE-2024-20255, all of which affect the API for the collaboration hardware.

CISA and OpenSSF Release Framework for Package Repository Security,"The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) announced that it's partnering with the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Securing Software Repositories Working Group to publish a new framework to secure package repositories.Called the Principles for Package Repository Security, the framework aims to establish a set of foundational rules for package managers and further harden open-source software ecosystems.""Package repositories are at a critical point in the open-source ecosystem to help prevent or mitigate such attacks,"" OpenSSF said.""Even simple actions like having a documented account recovery policy can lead to robust security improvements. At the same time, capabilities must be balanced with resource constraints of package repositories, many of which are operated by non-profit organizations.""Notably, the principles lay out four security maturity levels for package repositories across four categories of authentication, authorization, general capabilities, and command-line interface (CLI) tooling -- Level 0 - Having very little security maturity- Level 1 - Having basic security maturity, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and allowing security researchers to report vulnerabilities- Level 2 - Having moderate security, which includes actions like requiring MFA for critical packages and warning users of known security vulnerabilities- Level 3 - Having advanced security, which requires MFA for all maintainers and supports build provenance for packagesAll package management ecosystems should be working towards at least Level 1, the framework authors Jack Cable and Zach Steindler note.The ultimate objective is to allow package repositories to self-assess their security maturity and formulate a plan to bolster their guardrails over time in the form of security improvements.""Security threats change over time, as do the security capabilities that address those threats,"" OpenSSF said. ""Our goal is to help package repositories more quickly deliver the security capabilities that best help strengthen the security of their ecosystems.""The development comes as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) warned of security risks arising as a result of using open-source software for maintaining patient records, inventory management, prescriptions, and billing.""While open-source software is the bedrock of modern software development, it is also often the weakest link in the software supply chain,"" it said in a threat brief published in December 2023.",news and industry updates,vulnerability reports,FALSE
Ivanti Gets Poor Marks for Cyber Incident Response,"February 13, 2024Editor's note: CISA clarified its guidance regarding Ivanti VPN appliances to explain they may be reconnected to government networks following the completion of necessary mitigations. This story has been updated to reflect CISA's Feb. 9 supplemental advisory on Ivanti products.Here's what's clear about the current cybersecurity state of Ivanti's VPN appliances — they have been widely vulnerable to cyberattack, and threat actors are onto the possibilities. It's up to enterprise cyber teams to decide what comes next.So far, Ivanti has disclosed five VPN flaws in 2024, most exploited as zero-days — with two of them publicly announced weeks before patches became available. Some critics, like cybersecurity researcher Jake Williams, see the glut of Ivanti vulnerabilities, and the company's slow incident response, as an existential threat to the business.Williams blames Ivanti's current problems on years-long neglect of secure coding and security testing. To recover, Ivanti would have to both overcome that technical debt, according to Williams, while somehow building back trust with their customers. It's a task Williams adds he's dubious Ivanti will be able to pull off.""I don't see how Ivanti survives as an enterprise firewall brand,"" Williams tells Dark Reading, a sentiment he has repeated widely on social media.A more generous view of the recent spate of zero-day disclosures is that it's a positive sign Ivanti is taking a long, hard look at its cybersecurity.""Ivanti is digging deep into its own products in order to find, fix, and disclose vulnerabilities, and deserves some credit for that,"" John Gallagher, vice president of Viakoo Labs says.Asked for comment, Ivanti referred Dark Reading to its Feb. 8 blog post regarding its most recent disclosure.Ivanti's Woes Fall On Cyber TeamsUltimately, enterprise teams will have to choose. Cyber teams can following CISA's advice and disconnect Ivanti VPN appliances and update before they are reconnected. Or, while they're already offline for patching, they can replace Ivanti appliances altogether. They also have to explain the decision to higher-ups.Patching is a reasonable response, but Ivanti's patching schedule was delayed for the aforementioned pair of zero-day vulnerabilities disclosed on Jan. 10 (CVE-2024-21887 and CVE-2023-46805). These ended up being under active exploit without a patch for 20 days before receiving patches on Jan. 30. But they came with more bad news: The Ivanti update also included fixes for two additional previously undisclosed bugs (CVE-2024-21888 and CVE-2024-21893), the latter of which had also already been under active exploitation in the wild.That was enough for CISA to issue a Feb. 1 mandate for federal agencies to disconnect Ivanti products from their systems. CISA issued a clarification to the directive on Feb. 9 that Ivanti VPN appliances may be reconnected to government networks once they are sufficiently patched, and in some cases, reset to factory settings.A fifth Ivanti vulnerability was disclosed on Feb. 9, tracked as CVE-2024-22024. Eventually, Ivanti credited watchTowr with the find, though at first it claimed internal teams found the bug, sowing some confusion in bug-hunter ranks.Further undermining confidence in Ivanti security practices is the fact that the initial Jan. 10 bugs were originally due to get patches on Jan. 22 — but Ivanti pushed the release date back to the 30th.""These devices need their software engineered with the same kind of seriousness that this threat requires,"" says John Bambenek, president at Bambenek Consulting. ""When you publish zero-day patch schedules, you need to hit those targets, especially in a situation like this.""Meanwhile Ivanti's persistent flaws have attracted crowds of cybercriminals, including Chinese state-sponsored threat actors. And cyber researcher ""Shadowserver"" Pitor Kijewski confirmed to Dark Reading that there are at least 47 IPs to date attempting to exploit the most recently disclosed Ivanti VPN bug.There is some confusion here too: Ivanti issued the following statement to Dark Reading in response to the Shadowserver report: ""We have no indication that CVE-2024-22024 has been exploited in the wild.""Viakoo's Gallagher gives Ivanti poor marks for its incident response so far.""Ivanti’s recovery will need to address both the technical aspects of these attacks, and the trust/reputational damage this has caused them,"" he says. ""On both fronts they have stumbled badly.""Ivanti Vows to Fix Flaws, Customers CautiousIn a Feb. 8 advisory about the most recent Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways bugs, Ivanti assured customers it is now doing a full audit of its code.""Our team has been working around the clock to aggressively review all code and is singularly focused on bringing full resolution to the issues affecting Ivanti Connect Secure (formerly Pulse Connect Secure), Ivanti Policy Secure and ZTA gateways,"" the company said.As Ivanti's cybersecurity troubles mount, the lesson for cyber teams is that reactive patching alone of edge devices isn't sufficient, according to Patrick Tiquet, vice president of security and architecture at Keeper Security.""It is imperative that vendors prioritize identifying and resolving issues within their solutions,"" Tiquet says. ""But organizations should regularly engage in pen-testing of their own products and services to proactively find vulnerabilities before someone else does.""Only time will tell if Ivanti will be able to woo its customers back who've already left, and reassure the ones who have stuck around, but in the meantime, Bambanek advises enterprise security teams remain cautious.""If I were a CISO, I'd take a pass on Ivanti for a few years until they’ve proven themselves again,"" he adds.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Midnight Blizzard and Cloudflare-Atlassian Cybersecurity Incidents: What to Know,"The Midnight Blizzard and Cloudflare-Atlassian cybersecurity incidents raised alarms about the vulnerabilities inherent in major SaaS platforms. These incidents illustrate the stakes involved in SaaS breaches — safeguarding the integrity of SaaS apps and their sensitive data is critical but is not easy. Common threat vectors such as sophisticated spear-phishing, misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in third-party app integrations demonstrate the complex security challenges facing IT systems.In the case of Midnight Blizzard, password spraying against a test environment was the initial attack vector. For Cloudflare-Atlassian, threat actors initiated the attack via compromised OAuth tokens from a prior breach at Okta, a SaaS identity security provider.What Exactly Happened?Microsoft Midnight Blizzard BreachMicrosoft was targeted by the Russian ""Midnight Blizzard"" hackers (also known as Nobelium, APT29, or Cozy Bear) who are linked to the SVR, the Kremlin's foreign intelligence service unit.In the Microsoft breach, the threat actors:- Used a password spray strategy on a legacy account and historic test accounts that did not have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. According to Microsoft, the threat actors ""[used] a low number of attempts to evade detection and avoid account blocks based on the volume of failures.""- Leveraged the compromised legacy account as an initial entry point to then hijack a legacy test OAuth app. This legacy OAuth app had high-level permissions to access Microsoft's corporate environment.- Created malicious OAuth apps by exploiting the legacy OAuth app's permissions. Because the threat actors controlled the legacy OAuth app, they could maintain access to the applications even if they lost access to the initially compromised account.- Granted admin Exchange permissions and admin credentials to themselves.- Escalated privileges from OAuth to a new user, which they controlled.- Consented to the malicious OAuth applications using their newly created user account.- Escalated the legacy application's access further by granting it full access to M365 Exchange Online mailboxes. With this access, Midnight Blizzard could view M365 email accounts belonging to senior staff members and exfiltrate corporate emails and attachments.|Recreation of illustration by Amitai CohenCloudflare-Atlassian BreachOn Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 2023, Cloudflare's Atlassian systems were also compromised by a nation-state attack.- This breach, which started on November 15, 2023, was made possible through the use of compromised credentials that had not been changed following a previous breach at Okta in October 2023.- Attackers accessed Cloudflare's internal wiki and bug database, enabling them to view 120 code repositories in Cloudflare's Atlassian instance.- 76 source code repositories related to key operational technologies were potentially exfiltrated.- Cloudflare detected the threat actor on November 23 because the threat actor connected a Smartsheet service account to an admin group in Atlassian.Think your SaaS security is top-notch? Appomni surveyed over 600 global security practitioners, and 79% of professionals felt the same – yet they faced cybersecurity incidents! Dive into the insights of the AppOmni 2023 Report.Learn How You CanThreat Actors Increasingly Target SaaSThese breaches are part of a broader pattern of nation-state actors targeting SaaS service providers, including but not limited to espionage and intelligence gathering. Midnight Blizzard previously engaged in significant cyber operations, including the 2021 SolarWinds attack.These incidents underscore the importance of continuous monitoring of your SaaS environments and the ongoing risk posed by sophisticated cyber adversaries targeting critical infrastructure and operational tech stack. They also highlight significant vulnerabilities related to SaaS identity management and the necessity for stringent 3rd-party app risk management practices.Attackers use common tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to breach SaaS providers through the following kill chain:- Initial access: Password spray, hijacking OAuth- Persistence: Impersonates admin, creates extra OAuth- Defense Evasion: Highly privileged OAuth, no MFA- Lateral Movement: Broader compromise of connected apps- Data Exfiltration: Grab privileged and sensitive data out of appsBreaking the SaaS Kill ChainOne effective way to break the kill chain early is with continuous monitoring, granular policy enforcement, and proactive lifecycle management over your SaaS environments. A SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) platform like AppOmni can help with detecting and alerting on:- Initial Access: Out-of-the-box rules to detect credential compromise, including password spraying, brute force attacks, and unenforced MFA policies- Persistence: Scan and identify OAuth permissions and detect OAuth hijacking- Defense Evasion: Access policy checks, detect if a new identity provider (IdP) is created, detect permission changes.- Lateral Movement: Monitor logins and privileged access, detect toxic combinations, and understand the blast radius of a potentially compromised accountNote: This expertly contributed article is written by Beverly Nevalga, AppOmni.",data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,TRUE
Meta brushes off risk of account theft via number recycling,"Meta says risk of account theft after phone number recycling isn't its problem to solveLeaves it to carriers, promoting a complaint to Irish data cops from Big Tech's bête noireMeta has acknowledged that phone number reuse that allows takeovers of its accounts ""is a concern,"" but the ad biz insists the issue doesn't qualify for its bug bounty program and is a matter for telecom companies to sort out.The core problem is that telecom companies recycle phone numbers that have been abandoned after a brief waiting period – at least 45 days in the US. That can become a problem because many online services require a phone number to identify users and/or send one-time passwords for two-factor authentication. Users who abandon a number, and forget to update their new number, are therefore at risk of malicious account reset attempts by whoever gets access to their old numbers. Account takeovers are a common consequence.This is not a new issue. In 2021, privacy researchers from Princeton University published a report [PDF] on the topic titled, ""Security and Privacy Risks of Number Recycling at Mobile Carriers in the United States.""The report found 171 of 259 sampled numbers ""were tied to existing accounts at popular websites, potentially allowing those accounts to be hijacked."" It also found that 100 of those 259 were linked to leaked login credentials that would make it easier to defeat SMS-based multi-factor authentication.The findings were disclosed to telecom carriers in October 2020, and various measures were put into place to make it more difficult to hijack telecom accounts. T-Mobile for example published a support page advising customers who change numbers to ""update your contact number on any accounts that may have your number saved, such as notifications for bank accounts, social media, etc.""Nonetheless, it appears this vulnerability persists with other online services that rely on mobile phone numbers for multi-factor authentication.Enter one of Big Tech's least favorite activistsPrivacy consultant Alexander Hanff, an occasional contributor to The Register, noted a social media post in which a Reddit user describes gaining access to a ""random girl's"" account by using a newly provisioned mobile phone number to login to Meta's Instagram service.""So naturally I got curious and tested other apps,"" the post says. ""TikTok, Snapchat, Amazon, Facebook, Messenger, Cash App, and DoorDash were all easily accessible with this new number into this random person's account. But now I'm also scared because if I can do it, then the person who gets my old number can [too]? Isn't this like against some law or something?""- FCC gets tough: Telcos must now tell you when your personal info is stolen- Europe's largest caravan club admits wide array of personal data potentially accessed- Crime gang targeted jobseekers across Asia, looted two million email addresses- Meta to try 'cutting edge' AI detection on its platforms - asking people to add labelsThe post omits some details that clarify how this might work – The Register has not verified that all the services cited above can be compromised as claimed.If, for example, a Facebook user changes phone numbers but fails to note that change in Facebook or other accounts that use it for authentication, the recipient of the old, recycled number can try to login to the Facebook account still linked to that number. Doing so generally requires a password too.But not having the password isn't necessarily a barrier. The phone number may be sufficient to reset the password and access it despite multi-factor authentication. Typically, users are sent notification of the password change to the email address associated with their account.In some login flows for a new sign-in, like the one used by DoorDash, an email address is required first, though isn't necessary thereafter. After providing an email address and clicking ""Continue to Sign In,"" a user can provide that same email address or a phone number to receive a one-time verification code sent in a text message that completes the login process. In this instance, controlling the phone number provides account access without need for concurrent email validation.Procedural variations aside, initiating a password reset without permission to hijack an online account is against the law in the US, the UK, and elsewhere, Hanff wrote in his reply, in addition to being a privacy intrusion.Hanff subsequently tried to alert Meta. ""I reported this under their security vulnerabilities (bug bounty) system as there is no other obvious way to report this,"" he told The Register. ""Obviously I am not interested in any bounty, I am just trying to get this fixed, but Meta has a habit of obstructing people from contacting them.""No bounty for you says MetaMeta has rejected Hanff's bug bounty report. The company's reply, provided to The Register, reads as follows:There are situations where phone numbers expire that are made available to someone other than the original owner. For example, if a number has a new owner and they use it to log into Facebook, it could trigger a Facebook password reset. If that number is still associated with the user's Facebook account, the person who now has that number could then take over the account.While this is a concern, this isn't considered a bug for the bug bounty program. Facebook doesn't have control over telecom providers who reissue phone numbers or with users having a phone number linked to their Facebook account that is no longer registered to them.Hanff, in a LinkedIn post, argued this is unacceptable.""We do not say 'Well we know that passwords with low entropy can be hacked very quickly, but we are not responsible for people using password busting technology so we will continue to allow four-character passwords consisting of only lower-case letters in the first half of the alphabet,'"" he wrote.""So if you know a risk exists, the whole point of security design is to mitigate or remove those risks, not ignore them because you are not responsible for them.""Hanff said he has reported Meta to the Irish Data Protection Commission for alleged violations of Articles 5, 25 and 32 of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. Those rules require responsible data handling.Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. ®",news and industry updates,vulnerability reports,FALSE
"FCC Requires Telecom, VoIP Providers to Report PII Breaches","February 13, 2024Starting next month, telecom and VoIP providers will have to issue data breach notifications to customers whenever there's personally identifiable information (PII) caught up in a cyber incident.That's according to new rules issued yesterday by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which will now also require carriers and service providers to report breaches to the FCC, the FBI, and the Secret Service within seven days of discovery. The Commission's definition of PII is broad and encompasses not only names, contact information, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers, but also biometrics and a slew of other data.Previously, the FCC required customer notifications only when Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) data was impacted; CPNI can be thought of as phone bill information, i.e., subscription plan data, usage charges, numbers called or messaged, and so on.""The Commission believes that the unauthorized exposure of sensitive personal information … is reasonably likely to pose risk of customer harm,"" according to the FCC's new data breach rules. ""Consumers expect that they will be notified of substantial breaches that endanger their privacy, and businesses that handle sensitive personal information should expect to be obligated to report such breaches.""Phone providers are off the hook for contacting customers, however, if they can reasonably determine the incident is unlikely to harm the customers, though the definition of a ""breach"" has been expanded by the agency to include ""inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of customer information.""The last update to the FCC's breach reporting requirements was 16 years ago.""The pervasiveness of data breaches and the frequency of breach notifications have evolved and increased since the Commission first adopted its breach notification rule in 2007,"" according to the FCC. It added, ""This rising tide of data breaches has affected the telecommunications sector as well. As the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) points out, the proprietary information of subscribers of each of the three largest carriers has been breached at least once within the last five years.""Most recently, a Verizon insider threat breach revealed earlier this month exposed information for tens of thousands of employees; T-Mobile saw three different customer breaches in 2023; and a vendor breach last March led to the exposure of data for 9 million AT&T wireless customers.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",regulatory changes and compliance,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
U.S. Offers $10 Million Bounty for Info Leading to Arrest of Hive Ransomware Leaders,"The U.S. Department of State has announced monetary rewards of up to $10 million for information about individuals holding key positions within the Hive ransomware operation.It is also giving away an additional $5 million for specifics that could lead to the arrest and/or conviction of any person ""conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in Hive ransomware activity.""The multi-million-dollar rewards come a little over a year after a coordinated law enforcement effort covertly infiltrated and dismantled the darknet infrastructure associated with the Hive ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) gang. One person with suspected ties to the group was arrested in Paris in December 2023.Hive, which emerged in mid-2021, targeted more than 1,500 victims in over 80 countries, netting about $100 million in illegal revenues. In November 2023, Bitdefender revealed that a new ransomware group called Hunters International had acquired the source code and infrastructure from Hive to kick-start its own efforts.There is some evidence to suggest that the threat actors associated with Hunters International are likely based in Nigeria, specifically an individual named Olowo Kehinde, per information gathered by Netenrich security researcher Rakesh Krishnan, although it could also be a fake persona adopted by the actors to cover up their true origins.Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, in its 2023 review published last week, estimated that ransomware crews raked in $1.1 billion in extorted cryptocurrency payments from victims last year, compared to $567 million in 2022, all but confirming that ransomware rebounded in 2023 following a relative drop off in 2022.""2023 marks a major comeback for ransomware, with record-breaking payments and a substantial increase in the scope and complexity of attacks — a significant reversal from the decline observed in 2022,"" it said.The decline in ransomware activity in 2022 has been deemed a statistical aberration, with the downturn attributed to the Russo-Ukrainian war and the disruption of Hive. What's more, the total number of victims posted on data leak sites in 2023 was 4,496, up from 3,048 in 2021 and 2,670 in 2022.Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, in its own analysis of ransomware gangs' public listings of victims on dark web sites, called out manufacturing as the most impacted industry vertical in 2023, followed by profession and legal services, high technology, retail, construction, and healthcare sectors.While the law enforcement action prevented approximately $130 million in ransom payments to Hive, it's said that the takedown also ""likely affected the broader activities of Hive affiliates, potentially lessening the number of additional attacks they could carry out."" In total, the effort may have averted at least $210.4 million in payments.Adding to the escalation in the regularity, scope, and volume of attacks, last year also witnessed a surge in new entrants and offshoots, a sign that the ransomware ecosystem is attracting a steady stream of new players who are attracted by the prospect of high profits and lower barriers to entry.Cyber insurance provider Corvus said the number of active ransomware gangs registered a ""significant"" 34% increase between Q1 and Q4 2023, growing from 35 to 47 either due to fracturing and rebranding or other actors getting hold of leaked encryptors. Twenty-five new ransomware groups emerged in 2023.""The frequency of rebranding, especially among actors behind the biggest and most notorious strains, is an important reminder that the ransomware ecosystem is smaller than the large number of strains would make it appear,"" Chainalysis said.Besides a notable shift to big game hunting – which refers to the tactic of targeting very large companies to extract hefty ransoms – ransom payments are being steadily routed through cross-chain bridges, instant exchangers, and gambling services, indicating that e-crime groups are slowly moving away from centralized exchanges and mixers in pursuit of new avenues for money laundering.In November 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Sinbad, a virtual currency mixer that has been put to use by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group to launder ill-gotten proceeds. Some of the other sanctioned mixers include Blender, Tornado Cash, and ChipMixer.The pivot to big game hunting is also a consequence of companies increasingly refusing to settle, as the number of victims who chose to pay dropped to a new low of 29% in the last quarter of 2023, according to data from Coveware.""Another factor contributing to higher ransomware numbers in 2023 was a major shift in threat actors' use of vulnerabilities,"" Corvus said, highlighting Cl0p's exploitation of flaws in Fortra GoAnywhere and Progress MOVEit Transfer.""If malware, like infostealers, provide a steady drip of new ransomware victims, then a major vulnerability is like turning on a faucet. With some vulnerabilities, relatively easy access to thousands of victims can materialize seemingly overnight.""Cybersecurity company Recorded Future revealed that ransomware groups' weaponization of security vulnerabilities falls into two clear categories: vulnerabilities that have only been exploited by one or two groups and those that have been widely exploited by multiple threat actors.""Magniber has uniquely focused on Microsoft vulnerabilities, with half of its unique exploits focusing on Windows Smart Screen,"" it noted. ""Cl0p has uniquely and infamously focused on file transfer software from Accellion, SolarWinds, and MOVEit. ALPHV has uniquely focused on data backup software from Veritas and Veeam. REvil has uniquely focused on server software from Oracle, Atlassian, and Kaseya.""The continuous adaptation observed among cybercrime crews is also evidenced in the uptick in DarkGate and PikaBot infections following the takedown of the QakBot malware network, which had been the preferred initial entry pathway into target networks for ransomware deployment.Chainalysis further said it found a ""correlation"" between inflows to initial access broker (IAB) wallets and a spike in ransomware payments, suggesting that keeping tabs on IABs blockchain trails could provide early warning signs for potential intervention and mitigation of attacks.""Ransomware groups such as Cl0p have used zero-day exploits against newly discovered critical vulnerabilities, which represent a complex challenge for potential victims,"" Unit 42 said.""While ransomware leak site data can provide valuable insight on the threat landscape, this data might not accurately reflect the full impact of a vulnerability. Organizations must not only be vigilant about known vulnerabilities, but they must also develop strategies to quickly respond to and mitigate the impact of zero-day exploits.""",security updates and patches,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
FCC publishes final version of new breach report rules,"FCC gets tough: Telcos must now tell you when your personal info is stolenYep, cell carriers didn't have to do this beforeThe FCC's updated reporting requirements mean telcos in America will have just seven days to officially disclose that a criminal has broken into their systems.After releasing a proposed rule in early January and giving the industry 30 days to respond, the FCC's final rule was published today. It solidifies what the agency proposed a little more than a month ago, and what was teased in early 2022 when FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel drafted initial changes to the commission's 16-year old security ""breach"" reporting duties.Along with requiring that attacks are reported to the FCC within seven days of a telco discovering them, the same deadline now exists to report any data leaks to the FBI and US Secret Service as well. As the FCC planned, the new rule also eliminates the mandatory seven-day waiting period for reporting break-ins to consumers.The FCC now ""requires carriers to notify customers of breaches of covered data without unreasonable delay … and in no case more than 30 days following reasonable determination of a breach.""""Reasonable determination"" of a data blurt is further defined as ""when the carrier has information indicating that it is more likely than not that there was a breach"" and ""does not mean reaching a conclusion regarding every fact surrounding a data security incident that may constitute a breach.""In other words, if customers are affected then they had better be notified post-haste.The FCC has additionally extended the scope of data exposure types that telecom customers must be notified of. Prior to the passage of the new rule customers only had to be told if Customer proprietary network information (CPNI) was exposed to the world.CPNI, for those unfamiliar, is all the data a cellular carrier retains about phone calls and service agreements - i.e., the data that appears on a bill. Personal identifiable information (PII) wasn't included in previous reporting requirements, meaning carriers whose customer records were exposed, didn't have to tell customers if CPNI wasn't accessed.""Without an FCC rule requiring breach notifications for the above categories of PII, there would be no requirement in Federal law that telecommunications carriers report non-CPNI breaches to their customers,"" the FCC said of the new rule.Starting now, names, government ID numbers, data used for authentication purposes, email addresses/passwords and biometric data is all included in the FCC's reporting requirements. Dissociated data, if linkable to an individual using other data criminals accessed during a break-in, has to be reported as well.The new rules add an exception for customer notifications as well. If a carrier can ""determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur,"" then it doesn't have to inform subscribers of the incident.Along with increased reporting rules for the content of data leaks, the new rule also expands the FCC's definition of ""breach"" to include ""inadvertent access, use or disclosure of customer information.""Inadvertent, much like the exposure of 63k employee records Verizon reported last week.Luckily for Verizon it won't have to worry about falling foul of the new rules, which don't go into effect until March 13.Telecom relay service providers, which provide assistance for hearing-impaired phone users, will be covered under the new rule as well.Here a breach, there a breach, everywhere a breach reportThe FCC's updated directive is the latest in a string of federal agency breach reporting requirements, with rules passed by the FTC and SEC set to go into effect later this year, and federal contractors getting their own set of newly-proposed IT security breach reporting rules too.As has been the case with those other rules, the FCC's requirements, when formally proposed last month, ran up against opposition.- Future of America's Cyber Safety Review Board hangs in balance amid calls for rethink- Blackbaud settles with FTC after that IT breach exposed millions of people's info- Mon Dieu! Nearly half the French population have data nabbed in massive breach- 40% of IT security pros say they've been told not to report a data leakPer the FCC, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association raised an objection on several grounds, including that the FCC rule would create a system of dual jurisdiction between the FCC and FTC once the latter's rule goes into effect.As has been the case with objections raised to the wide and varying data leak reporting requirements now enacted by the US federal government, the FCC said it finds industry objections ""unpersuasive.""Congress has even raised objections to some of the new reporting rules, with bills introduced in the House and Senate to overturn the SEC's four-day reporting deadline for data break-ins that could have a ""material"" effect on a company's finances and, by extension, its investors.The feds were generally dismissive of the complaints, with the Biden administration saying it would veto any attempts to undo the SEC's reporting rules.Industry figures, and congressional representatives, have pointed to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's forthcoming rules for security breach requirements as a potential inter-agency standard. It's not clear whether CISA's rules, a draft of which is expected to be published next month, will harmonize standards or otherwise eliminate the need for companies covered under multiple rules to make multiple reports. ®",regulatory changes and compliance,regulatory changes and compliance,TRUE
PikaBot Resurfaces with Streamlined Code and Deceptive Tactics,"The threat actors behind the PikaBot malware have made significant changes to the malware in what has been described as a case of ""devolution.""""Although it appears to be in a new development cycle and testing phase, the developers have reduced the complexity of the code by removing advanced obfuscation techniques and changing the network communications,"" Zscaler ThreatLabz researcher Nikolaos Pantazopoulos said.PikaBot, first documented by the cybersecurity firm in May 2023, is a malware loader and a backdoor that can execute commands and inject payloads from a command-and-control (C2) server as well as allow the attacker to control the infected host.It is also known to halt its execution should the system's language be Russian or Ukrainian, indicating that the operators are either based in Russia or Ukraine.In recent months, both PikaBot and another loader called DarkGate have emerged as attractive replacements for threat actors such as Water Curupira (aka TA577) to obtain initial access to target networks via phishing campaigns and drop Cobalt Strike.Zscaler's analysis of a new version of PikaBot (version 1.18.32) observed this month has revealed its continued focus on obfuscation, albeit with simpler encryption algorithms, and insertion of junk code between valid instructions as part of its efforts to resist analysis.Another crucial modification observed in the latest iteration is that the entire bot configuration -- which is similar to that of QakBot -- is stored in plaintext in a single memory block as opposed to encrypting each element and decoding them at runtime.A third change concerns the C2 server network communications, with the malware developers tweaking the command IDs and the encryption algorithm used to secure the traffic.""Despite its recent inactivity, PikaBot continues to be a significant cyber threat and in constant development,"" the researchers concluded.""However, the developers have decided to take a different approach and decrease the complexity level of PikaBot's code by removing advanced obfuscation features.""The development comes as Proofpoint alerted of an ongoing cloud account takeover (ATO) campaign that has targeted dozens of Microsoft Azure environments and compromised hundreds of user accounts, including those belonging to senior executives.The activity, underway since November 2023, singles out users with individualized phishing lures bearing decoy files that contain links to malicious phishing web pages for credential harvesting, and use them for follow-on data exfiltration, internal and external phishing, and financial fraud.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
BofA Warns Customers of Data Leak in Third-Party Breach,"February 13, 2024Bank of America has warned customers of a leak of their sensitive data that occurred due to a ransomware attack that breached the environment at technology partner Infosys McCamish Systems (IMS) last autumn. It's an incident that once again highlights the importance of securing access to data and environments across third-party systems.At least 57,028 customers were affected in the breach, which occurred when ""when an unauthorized third party accessed IMS systems, resulting in the non-availability of certain IMS applications,"" according to a data breach disclosure form filed in Maine by IMS, and a separate letter (PDF) sent on behalf of Bank of America to affected customers. The financial institution serves about 69 million clients across more than 35 countries globally.The form and letter offer different timelines for when the breach occurred. The disclosure firm claims it occurred on Oct. 29, with IMS discovering it the following day. The letter says it occurred ""on or around Nov. 3.""No matter, the attack caused some unspecified systems in IMS' technology environment — which provides insurance process management solutions and services — to be rendered unavailable. The attack also exposed sensitive data — including the combination of people's names or other personal identifiers with their Social Security numbers — from Bank of America deferred-compensation plans, for which the company provides services.However, IMS noted that it ""is unlikely that we will be able to determine with certainty what personal information was accessed as a result of this incident,"" though it ""may have included"" not only people's names and SSNs, but also addresses, business email addresses, dates of birth, and other account info.LockBit Claims ResponsibilityA few days later on Nov. 4, the LockBit ransomware gang posted an ad for the sale of stolen data on its Dark Web site claiming to be from more than 2,000 IMS systems that were encrypted by the threat actor in an attack, according to a screenshot posted by @DarkWebInformer on X, formerly Twitter, and flagged in a published report. The post listed a deadline of Nov. 9 for the company to pay ransom before it would post the leaked data. It's unclear at this time if that occurred or if the ransom was paid.IMS informed Bank of America on Nov. 24 that data concerning deferred-compensation plans serviced by the bank may have been compromised, though Bank of America systems were not affected by the breach.IMS retained a third-party forensic firm to investigate and assist with the company's recovery plan in response to the incident, ""which included containing and remediating malicious activity, rebuilding systems, and enhancing response capabilities,"" the company said in its letter to customers.""To date, IMS has found no evidence of continued threat actor access, tooling, or persistence in the IMS environment,"" according to IMS.Bank of America said it is not aware that any data exposed in the breach has been misused. Even so, the bank is providing affected customers a complimentary two-year membership in an identity theft protection service provided by Experian IdentityWorks to help them protect their data.Neither IMS nor Bank of America immediately responded to requests for comment about the incident on Feb. 13.Managing Third-Party Cyber-RiskAccessing a company's data via that company's partner or customer has become all-too-common for organizations, and security experts and technology providers alike have offered a range of suggestions and solutions for this third-party exposure — including risk-management and risk-assessment strategies — to mitigate these threats.However, the problem persists, demonstrating ""that the complexity of a typical organization's digital landscape, completely protecting against all forms of risk is close to impossible,"" notes Roger Neal, head of product at Apona Security, in an email to Dark Reading.He suggests that organizations consider not only risk-management or -assessment solutions, but also demand a software bill of materials (SBOM) from all third-party vendors to better assess and manage vulnerabilities so they can take control before an attack even occurs.""While the breach's specifics…are yet to be fully disclosed, it's possible that early detection of vulnerable components might have mitigated or prevented this incident,"" Neal posits.Another potential strategy to protect against such breaches could be ""to require hosting third-party services on-premises, thereby ensuring more control over access to sensitive customer information,"" he adds.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

Though still legally allowed to appoint warrant officers, the rank has gone unused since. This week's move reintroduces the rank in a limited capacity for the first time in more than 30 years in a bid to draw tech talent that'll be paid better than an enlisted airmen without the added burden of broad command responsibility.""We know there are people who want to serve.

Australian Tax Office probed 150 staff in social media scam,"Australian Tax Office probed 150 staff over social media refund scam$1.3 billion lost as identity fraud – and greed – saw 57,000 or more seek unearned tax refundsOne hundred and fifty people who worked for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) have been investigated – and some prosecuted – for participating in a tax refund scam promoted on Facebook and TikTok.The extent of the scam was revealed on Monday in an audit of the ATO's management and oversight of fraud control arrangements for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) – Australia's equivalent of a value-added or sales tax.Down under, as elsewhere, businesses can claim refunds for the sales tax they pay on their own purchases.The World Bank ranks Australia as the seventh-easiest country on Earth in which to start a business, in part because one step in the process – obtaining an Australian Business Number (ABN) – can be accomplished online with very little effort. An ABN is also one of the few requirements to register for GST refunds. The tools to request a refund are also online, and easy to use – even this Vulture managed to employ them (entirely legitimately) for a few years.The scam promoted in online ads detailed a means of securing a loan from the ATO – an outright lie, as Australian tax authorities are not notably more generous than others around the world. Those who responded to the scam ads were advised on methods to create a fake business, fraudulently apply for an ABN, and then lodge false claims for a GST refund.The scam worked spectacularly well for a time. The audit into the ATO found A$2 billion ($1.29 billion) of fraudulent GST refund claims and 57,000 participants in the scheme in the period between April 2022 and June 30, 2023.- Aussie tech worker payroll scheme operators found guilty of tax fraud- DDoS attack? Mad dash to file forms? No, errant network switch crashed Australian tax service- Australia passes Right To Disconnect law, including (for now) jail time for bosses who email after-hours- Official probe into HPE’s Oz 3Par crashes would create 'further negative publicity' if revealedThe ATO had, by then, started fighting back. The audit document revealed that from mid-2021 the ATO received increased numbers of GST fraud tipoffs, and from December 2021 financial institutions sent an elevated volume of alerts regarding suspicious GST and income tax refunds.By January 2022 the ATO was tracking so many cases that it knew it did not have enough people to handle them all. In April of the same year, 470 people were allocated to address the mess, and the effort was named Operation Protego.Some of the fraudulent claims were lodged by stolen identities.As Operation Protego continued, 150 ATO officials were identified as worthy of investigation.The ATO yesterday described ""the majority"" of those investigated as ""former contractors or ex-employees [who] were not working with the ATO at the time they are suspected of committing Operation Protego fraud.""Some of the ATO officials were themselves the victims of identity theft and were not perpetrators.But a dozen ATO staff were found to have committed fraud while working for the tax office. Sanctions on that dirty dozen included termination of contract, administrative action, and criminal prosecutions.Many others were prosecuted as a result of Operation Protego. The ATO has shared details of one perp, who reactivated an ABN for a jewelry and silver manufacturing business and then lodged 63 false GST claims that netted A$73,650 ($47,500) – and 20 months jail. Other false claims discovered during Operation Protego sought millions in GST refunds an resulted in sentences of seven-and-a-half years.Australia's Serious Financial Crime Taskforce continues to pursue those who promoted the scheme.While it's come as a shock that 150 ATO employees were suspected of tax fraud, the audit found that the tax org's efforts prevented an additional A$2.7 billion ($1.75 billion) in suspect GST refunds, saw A$123 million ($79.5 million) recovered, and are racking up huge interest on false refunds that are yet to be repaid.But it's not all good news for the ATO: the audit rated its GST fraud detection operations ""partly effective"" in three areas and ""largely effective"" in another. The document also found the ATO's enterprise framework for fraud ""is not fit for purpose and is not operating as intended.""The audit also rated the ATO's GST fraud detection methods ""largely appropriate"" – but at the same time detailed a classic organizational data flow mess. ""Registers of controls used to detect potential GST fraud are dispersed across ATO business lines and the ATO does not maintain a centralized register,"" the audit found. ""The dispersed nature of GST controls means the ATO relies on internal committee discussions to draw together a 'whole of GST product' perspective on the effectiveness of these methods, rather than on collated or aggregated data."" ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
"Bumblebee Malware Returns with New Tricks, Targeting U.S. Businesses","The infamous malware loader and initial access broker known as Bumblebee has resurfaced after a four-month absence as part of a new phishing campaign observed in February 2024.Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said the activity targets organizations in the U.S. with voicemail-themed lures containing links to OneDrive URLs.""The URLs led to a Word file with names such as ""ReleaseEvans#96.docm"" (the digits before the file extension varied),"" the company said in a Tuesday report. ""The Word document spoofed the consumer electronics company Humane.""Opening the document leverages VBA macros to launch a PowerShell command to download and execute another PowerShell script from a remote server that, in turn, retrieves and runs the Bumblebee loader.Bumblebee, first spotted in March 2022, is mainly designed to download and execute follow-on payloads such as ransomware. It has been put to use by multiple crimeware threat actors that previously observed delivering BazaLoader (aka BazarLoader) and IcedID.It's also suspected to be developed by threat actors the Conti and TrickBot cybercrime syndicate as a replacement for BazarLoader. In September 2023, Intel 471 disclosed a Bumblebee distribution campaign that employed Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) servers to disseminate the loader.The attack chain is notable for its reliance on macro-enabled documents in the attack chain, especially considering Microsoft began blocking macros in Office files downloaded from the internet by default starting July 2022, prompting threat actors to modify and diversify their approaches.The macro-based attack is also markedly different from pre-hiatus campaigns in which the phishing emails came with zipped LNK files bearing Bumblebee executables or HTML attachments that leveraged HTML smuggling to drop a RAR file, which exploited the WinRAR flaw tracked as CVE-2023-38831 to install the loader.The return of Bumblebee also coincides with the reappearance of new variants of QakBot, ZLoader, and PikaBot, with samples of QakBot distributed in the form of Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) files.""The .MSI drops a Windows .cab (Cabinet) archive, which in turn contains a DLL,"" cybersecurity firm Sophos said on Mastodon. ""The .MSI extracts the DLL from the .cab, and executes it using shellcode. The shellcode causes the DLL to spawn a second copy of itself and inject the bot code into the second instance's memory space.""The latest QakBot artifacts have been found to harden the encryption used to conceal strings and other information, including employing a crypter malware called DaveCrypter, making it more challenging to analyze. The new generation also reinstates the ability to detect whether the malware was running inside a virtual machine or sandbox.Another crucial modification includes encrypting all communications between the malware and the command-and-control (C2) server using AES-256, a stronger method than was used in versions prior to the dismantling of QakBot's infrastructure in late August 2023.""The takedown of the QakBot botnet infrastructure was a victory, but the bot's creators remain free, and someone who has access to QakBot's original source code has been experimenting with new builds and testing the waters with these latest variants,"" Andrew Brandt, principal researcher at Sophos X-Ops, said.""One of the most notable changes involve a change to the encryption algorithm the bot uses to conceal default configurations hardcoded into the bot, making it more difficult for analysts to see how the malware operates; the attackers are also restoring previously deprecated features, such as virtual machine (VM) awareness, and testing them out in these new versions.""QakBot has also emerged as the second most prevalent malware for January 2024, trailing behind FakeUpdates (aka SocGholish) but ahead of other families like Formbook, Nanocore, AsyncRAT, Remcos RAT, and Agent Tesla.The development comes as Malwarebytes revealed a new campaign in which phishing sites mimicking financial institutions like Barclays trick potential targets into downloading legitimate remote desktop software like AnyDesk to purportedly resolve non-existent issues and ultimately allow threat actors to gain control of the machine.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Romania ransomware crisis pinned to third-party incident,"Romanian hospital ransomware crisis attributed to third-party breachEmergency impacting more than 100 facilities appears to be caused by incident at software providerThe Romanian national cybersecurity agency (DNSC) has pinned the outbreak of ransomware cases across the country's hospitals to an incident at a service provider.It said an unnamed service provider reported an issue prior to the flood of hospitals alerting the agency to the attacks.The service provider operates the Hipocrate Information System (HIS) – a multipurpose healthcare management platform used by hospitals across the country. All hospitals caught up in the ransomware scourge are thought to have been breached via the HIS.Per legal reporting obligations in Romania, service providers must inform the DNSC and national CSIRT of incidents that significantly impact the continuity of essential services.""We are exactly in the scenario of the Backmydata/Phobos ransomware incident that affected dozens of hospitals in Romania,"" the DNSC said today.The scale of the ransomware emergency in Romania is bordering on the unbelievable as now more than 100 hospitals have been either disconnected from the internet or had their files encrypted.The DNSC confirmed today that an additional hospital had its data encrypted, taking the total to 26.A further 79 healthcare units were preemptively disconnected from the internet on Monday hours after the first attacks were reported. They remain under investigation to see if any of them were also a target of the attack.To put it into perspective, the number of affected healthcare centers has now surpassed the number of NHS trusts that were disrupted to some degree by 2017's WannaCry attack.The bulk of the attacks started in the late evening of February 11 and carried over into the early hours of the following day, the country's Ministry of Health said. However, the first was detected at the Pitesti Pediatric Hospital on February 10.One software company that is believed to be involved with running the app did not respond to our contact attempts. Its website also doesn't appear to be functioning properly, displaying elements in a haphazard, non-stylized way.The vast majority of the affected Romanian hospitals have recent backups available, the DNSC said, which is expected to enable relatively straightforward service restorations. One unnamed hospital, however, last backed up its data 12 days prior to the attack and could potentially face a more complex recovery.- Southern Water cyberattack expected to hit hundreds of thousands of customers- Bumblebee malware wakes from hibernation, forgets what year it is, attacks with macros- ALPHV blackmails Canadian pipeline after 'stealing 190GB of vital info'- Infosys subsidiary named as source of Bank of America data leakHospitals that use the Hipocrate platform have been issued with the following recommendations:-Identify affected systems and isolate them from the network and wider internet-Retain all materials received from the attackers, including the ransom note and any other communications. These will be used during investigations presumably after hospitals are restored to working order-Avoid shutting down any systems, since key evidence may be removed from RAM-Retain all logs for investigators' use-Check those logs to see which systems may have been compromised-Immediately inform all staff, patients, and business partners of the situation-Attempt systems restoration from backups after a full cleanup has been carried out-Ensure all software is upgraded to the latest available versionsOne oddity with the story is that the ransomware group is not known. Details left behind in the ransom note did not point to a specific group, which is unusual in modern attacks, and demanded 3.5 Bitcoin (around $180,000) as a ransom payment – a relatively low sum by current standards.""The attackers' message does not specify a group name claiming this attack, only an email address,"" the DNSC confirmed on Tuesday. ""Both the Directorate and other cybersecurity authorities involved in the analysis of this incident recommend that the attackers are not contacted and the requested ransom is not paid!""The ransomware used was said to be called Backmydata, a variant of the Phobos ransomware family that's been around for years under various guises and interactions.Most recently a slightly modified version of Phobos was deployed by the 8Base ransomware group, although it should be said that 8Base has not claimed nor been attributed to the attacks in Romania. ®",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
"Microsoft Rolls Out Patches for 73 Flaws, Including 2 Windows Zero-Days","Microsoft has released patches to address 73 security flaws spanning its software lineup as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for February 2024, including two zero-days that have come under active exploitation.Of the 73 vulnerabilities, 5 are rated Critical, 65 are rated Important, and three and rated Moderate in severity. This is in addition to 24 flaws that have been fixed in the Chromium-based Edge browser since the release of the January 2024 Patch Tuesday updates.The two flaws that are listed as under active attack at the time of release are below -- CVE-2024-21351 (CVSS score: 7.6) - Windows SmartScreen Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability- CVE-2024-21412 (CVSS score: 8.1) - Internet Shortcut Files Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability""The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to inject code into SmartScreen and potentially gain code execution, which could potentially lead to some data exposure, lack of system availability, or both,"" Microsoft said about CVE-2024-21351.Successful exploitation of the flaw could allow an attacker to circumvent SmartScreen protections and run arbitrary code. However, for the attack to work, the threat actor must send the user a malicious file and convince the user to open it.CVE-2024-21412, in a similar manner, permits an unauthenticated attacker to bypass displayed security checks by sending a specially crafted file to a targeted user.""However, the attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content."" Redmond noted. ""Instead, the attacker would have to convince them to take action by clicking on the file link.""CVE-2024-21351 is the second bypass bug to be discovered in SmartScreen after CVE-2023-36025 (CVSS score: 8.8), which was plugged by the tech giant in November 2023. The flaw has since been exploited by multiple hacking groups to proliferate DarkGate, Phemedrone Stealer, and Mispadu.Trend Micro, which detailed an attack campaign undertaken by Water Hydra (aka DarkCasino) targeting financial market traders by means of a sophisticated zero-day attack chain leveraging CVE-2024-21412, described CVE-2024-21412 as a bypass for CVE-2023-36025, thereby enabling threat actors to evade SmartScreen checks.Water Hydra, first detected in 2021, has a track record of launching attacks against banks, cryptocurrency platforms, trading services, gambling sites, and casinos to deliver a trojan called DarkMe using zero-day exploits, including the WinRAR flaw that came to light in August 2023 (CVE-2023-38831, CVSS score: 7.8).Late last year, Chinese cybersecurity company NSFOCUS graduated the ""economically motivated"" hacking group to an entirely new advanced persistent threat (APT).""In January 2024, Water Hydra updated its infection chain exploiting CVE-2024-21412 to execute a malicious Microsoft Installer File (.MSI), streamlining the DarkMe infection process,"" Trend Micro said.Both vulnerabilities have since been added to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), urging federal agencies to apply the latest updates by March 5, 2024.Also patched by Microsoft are five critical flaws -- CVE-2024-20684 (CVSS score: 6.5) - Windows Hyper-V Denial of Service Vulnerability- CVE-2024-21357 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Windows Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability- CVE-2024-21380 (CVSS score: 8.0) - Microsoft Dynamics Business Central/NAV Information Disclosure Vulnerability- CVE-2024-21410 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability- CVE-2024-21413 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Microsoft Outlook Remote Code Execution Vulnerability""CVE-2024-21410 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server,"" Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, said in a statement. ""This flaw is more likely to be exploited by attackers according to Microsoft.""""Exploiting this vulnerability could result in the disclosure of a targeted user's Net-New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) version 2 hash, which could be relayed back to a vulnerable Exchange Server in an NTLM relay or pass-the-hash attack, which would allow the attacker to authenticate as the targeted user.""The security update further resolves 15 remote code execution flaws in Microsoft WDAC OLE DB provider for SQL Server that an attacker could exploit by tricking an authenticated user into attempting to connect to a malicious SQL server via OLEDB.Rounding off the patch is a fix for CVE-2023-50387 (CVSS score: 7.5), a 24-year-old design flaw in the DNSSEC specification that can be abused to exhaust CPU resources and stall DNS resolvers, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).The vulnerability has been codenamed KeyTrap by the National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity (ATHENE) in Darmstadt.""[The researchers] demonstrated that just with a single DNS packet the attack can exhaust the CPU and stall all widely used DNS implementations and public DNS providers, such as Google Public DNS and Cloudflare,"" ATHENE said.

DarkMe Malware Targets Traders Using Microsoft SmartScreen Zero-Day Vulnerability,"A newly disclosed security flaw in the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen has been exploited as a zero-day by an advanced persistent threat actor called Water Hydra (aka DarkCasino) targeting financial market traders.Trend Micro, which began tracking the campaign in late December 2023, said it entails the exploitation of CVE-2024-21412, a security bypass vulnerability related to Internet Shortcut Files (.URL).""In this attack chain, the threat actor leveraged CVE-2024-21412 to bypass Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and infect victims with the DarkMe malware,"" the cybersecurity firm said in a Tuesday report.Microsoft, which addressed the flaw in its February Patch Tuesday update, said an unauthenticated attacker could exploit the flaw by sending the targeted user a specially crafted file in order to bypass displayed security checks.However, successful exploitation banks on the prerequisite that the threat actor convinces the victim to click on the file link to view the attacker-controlled content.The infection procedure documented by Trend Micro weaponizes CVE-2024-21412 to drop a malicious installer file (""7z.msi"") by clicking on a booby-trapped URL (""fxbulls[.]ru"") distributed via forex trading forums under the pretext of sharing a link to a stock chart image that, in reality, is an internet shortcut file (""photo_2023-12-29.jpg.url"").""The landing page on fxbulls[.]ru contains a link to a malicious WebDAV share with a filtered crafted view,"" security researchers Peter Girnus, Aliakbar Zahravi, and Simon Zuckerbraun said.""When users click on this link, the browser will ask them to open the link in Windows Explorer. This is not a security prompt, so the user might not think that this link is malicious.""The clever trick that makes this possible is the threat actor's abuse of the search: application protocol, which is used for calling the desktop search application on Windows and has been abused in the past to deliver malware.The rogue internet shortcut file, for its part, points to another internet shortcut file hosted on a remote server (""2.url""), which, in turn, points to a CMD shell script within a ZIP archive hosted on the same server (""a2.zip/a2.cmd"").This unusual referencing stems from the fact that ""calling a shortcut within another shortcut was sufficient to evade SmartScreen, which failed to properly apply Mark of the Web (MotW), a critical Windows component that alerts users when opening or running files from an untrusted source.""The end goal of the campaign is to deliver a Visual Basic trojan known as DarkMe stealthily in the background while displaying the stock graph to the victim to keep up the ruse upon completion of the exploitation and infection chain.DarkMe comes with capabilities to download and execute additional instructions, alongside registering itself with a command-and-control (C2) server and gathering information from the compromised system.The development comes amid a new trend where zero-days found by cybercrime groups end up getting incorporated into attack chains deployed by nation-state hacking groups to launch sophisticated attacks.""Water Hydra possess the technical knowledge and tools to discover and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in advanced campaigns, deploying highly destructive malware such as DarkMe,"" the researchers said.",vulnerability reports,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
JumpCloud's Q1 2024 SME IT Trends Report Reveals AI Optimism Tempered by Security Concerns,"February 15, 2024PRESS RELEASELOUISVILLE, Colo. — JumpCloud Inc., today announced the findings from its Q1 2024 small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) IT Trends Report, “State of IT 2024: The Rise of AI, Economic Uncertainty, and Evolving Security Threats”. The report provides updated survey results and new findings to the company’s biannual SME IT Trends Report, which was first released in June 2021. The latest edition of the report delves into the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on identity management, security challenges, economic uncertainties, and the growing reliance on managed service providers (MSPs) in IT operations.JumpCloud commissioned this biannual survey of SME IT admins to gain unique insights into the day-to-day experiences of IT professionals who power and secure operations without enterprise-level budgets and staff. The most recent survey results, polled from admins in the U.S., U.K., and India, indicates how quickly AI has impacted identity management and highlights that IT professionals have both big hopes and big fears in their response to it. With a strong majority of respondents both planning or actively implementing within the next year and advocating for AI investment, IT leaders clearly see potential benefits from deploying AI in their workplaces. But IT admins report notable concerns around their organizations’ current ability to secure against related threats—and personal concerns about AI’s impact on their career.“While AI is the buzzword that grabs headlines, it’s security that remains a paramount concern for IT teams given the increasing sophistication of external threats and rising regulatory pressures,” said Rajat Bhargava, CEO, JumpCloud. “And it’s only getting worse. We found that 56% of admins agree that they’re more concerned about their organization’s security posture now than they were six months ago. To reduce this complexity and anxiety, organizations should look toward solutions that offer a unified, open identity and IT management approach. This can enhance security, mitigate operational disruptions, and alleviate admin burnout.""The results of the JumpCloud Q1 2024 SME IT Trends Report are available in JumpCloud’s eBook, “State of IT 2024: The Rise of AI, Economic Uncertainty, and Evolving Security Threats,” which can be downloaded for free here.Key findings include:AI Adoption: Optimism and ConcernsA vast majority of admins see AI as a net positive for their organization and think their organization is approaching AI at the right pace—though this optimism is tempered by significant concerns about AI’s potential impact on security and individual careers.Topline AI findings include:Organizations are actively planning for AI: Just 13% of organizations do not currently have any plans to implement AI initiatives and 76% agree their organization should be investing in AI.Admins optimistic about AI: 79% report that AI will be a net positive, versus just 6% who see it as a net negative. Most admins agree their organizations are approaching AI adoption at exactly the right speed (55%). Roughly equal amounts think they are moving too quickly (22%) or too slow (19%).IT teams are wary about AI’s potential for organizational security and career: 62% agree that AI is outpacing their organization’s ability to protect against threats overall and nearly half (45%) worry about AI’s impact on their job.Uncertainty for ITThe start of 2024 finds SMEs continuing to wrestle with economic uncertainties and IT teams unsure about what that means for their organizations and their operations.Topline IT management findings include:Concerns about layoffs persist: 57% of organizations have experienced layoffs over the last year. Just over a quarter (27%) haven’t experienced layoffs and don’t expect any over the next six months.Admins worried about the impact of budget cuts on security: 72% agree that any cuts to their security budget will increase organizational risk, and 56% are more concerned about their organizations’ security posture than they were six months ago.Licensing costs increase while compliance mandates expand: 88% report vendors have increased prices over the last six months, and 76% report increased compliance and regulations requirements in their region.Device environments require IT flexibility, with Windows use down and macOS and Linux use up year-over-year: The average device type breakdown in SMEs is Windows at 60% (down from 64% in April 2023), macOS at 22% (up from 20% in April 2023), and Linux at 22% (up from 16% in April 2023).IT admins want centralized IT: 75% of IT professionals would prefer a single tool to do their job over a number of point solutions. In practice, admins most commonly need five to 10 applications to manage worker lifecycle (37%), though nearly one-quarter (22%) need 11 or more, and nearly 1 in 10 (9%) require more than 15 applications to manage worker lifecycle.Security Challenges Persist as Admins Adjust Their ResponseIT teams continue to report that security concerns continue to dominate among the various challenges and responsibilities they manage. With the rise of AI and the evolving sophistication of cybersecurity threats, IT admins are adapting their responses and deploying additional layers of protection.Topline security findings include:IT admins’ biggest challenge is security: 56% report security is the biggest IT challenge, followed by new services and application rollouts (45%), increased work burden (44%), followed by the cost of remote work solutions (42%).Biometrics adoption up, though password-based systems are stubborn: While 83% of organizations use password-based authentication for some IT resources, 83% also require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and over two-thirds require biometrics (66%)—even though 67% of IT professionals agree that adding additional security measures means a more cumbersome experience. The average employee has three to five passwords to log into their IT resources, though 15% of employees average 10 passwords or more.The biggest security threats remain the same: The three biggest security concerns now are the same ones from April 2023. IT admins reported network attacks were their biggest challenge (40%), followed by software vulnerability exploits (34%) and ransomware (29%).MSPs Play Major Role in IT OperationsMSPs are increasingly crucial to SME IT operations as increasing numbers of SMEs are turning to them for IT management.Topline MSP findings include:MSPs taking over IT for SMEs: While 76% of SMEs rely on an MSP for some features, 42% of organizations use an MSP to completely manage their IT environment, a 56% increase from April 2023.Organizations relying on MSPs for variety of functions: System security is the most common area for why SMEs use MSPs (57%) followed by cloud storage (52%), system monitoring (51%), system management (47%), managed backup (40%), hardware procurement (34%), business continuity/disaster recovery (32%), help desk (35%), and change management (27%).MSPs are seen to offer a broad range of benefits: The top reasons SMEs report using an MSP are that they are up to date on the latest technologies (65%), they can provide a better user experience (60%), and they are cost-effective (57%).Survey Methodology:JumpCloud surveyed 1,213 SME IT decision-makers in the U.K., U.S., and India, including managers, directors, vice presidents, and executives.

Ubuntu 'command-not-found' Tool Could Trick Users into Installing Rogue Packages,"Cybersecurity researchers have found that it's possible for threat actors to exploit a well-known utility called command-not-found to recommend their own rogue packages and compromise systems running Ubuntu operating system.""While 'command-not-found' serves as a convenient tool for suggesting installations for uninstalled commands, it can be inadvertently manipulated by attackers through the snap repository, leading to deceptive recommendations of malicious packages,"" cloud security firm Aqua said in a report shared with The Hacker News.Installed by default on Ubuntu systems, command-not-found suggests packages to install in interactive bash sessions when attempting to run commands that are not available. The suggestions include both the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) and snap packages.When the tool uses an internal database (""/var/lib/command-not-found/commands.db"") to suggest APT packages, it relies on the ""advise-snap"" command to suggest snaps that provide the given command.Thus, should an attacker be able to game this system and have their malicious package recommended by the command-not-found package, it could pave the way for software supply chain attacks.Aqua said it found a security loophole wherein the alias mechanism can be exploited by the threat actor to potentially register the corresponding snap name associated with an alias and trick users into installing the malicious package.What's more, an attacker could claim the snap name related to an APT package and upload a malicious snap, which then ends up being suggested when a user types in the command on their terminal.""The maintainers of the 'jupyter-notebook' APT package had not claimed the corresponding snap name,"" Aqua security researcher Ilay Goldman said. ""This oversight left a window of opportunity for an attacker to claim it and upload a malicious snap named 'jupyter-notebook.'""To make matters worse, the command-not-found utility suggests the snap package above the legitimate APT package for jupyter-notebook, misleading users into installing the fake snap package.As many as 26% of the APT package commands are vulnerable to impersonation by malicious actors, Aqua noted, presenting a substantial security risk, as they could be registered under an attacker's account.A third category entails typosquatting attacks in which typographical errors made by users (e.g., ifconfigg instead of ifconfig) are leveraged to suggest bogus snap packages by registering a fraudulent package with the name ""ifconfigg.""In such a case, command-not-found ""would mistakenly match it to this incorrect command and recommend the malicious snap, bypassing the suggestion for 'net-tools' altogether,"" Aqua researchers explained.Describing the abuse of the command-not-found utility to recommend counterfeit packages as a pressing concern, the company is urging users to verify the source of a package before installation and check the maintainers' credibility.Developers of APT and snap packages have also been advised to register the associated snap name for their commands to prevent them from being misused.""It remains uncertain how extensively these capabilities have been exploited, underscoring the urgency for heightened vigilance and proactive defense strategies,"" Aqua said.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Threat Actor Leverages Compromised Account of Former Employee to Access State Government Organization | CISA,"Actions to take today to mitigate malicious cyber activity:- Continuously remove and disable accounts and groups from the enterprise that are no longer needed, especially privileged accounts.- Enable and enforce multifactor authentication with strong passwords.- Store credentials in a secure manner, such as with a credential manager, vault, or other privilege account management solution.SUMMARYThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) conducted an incident response assessment of a state government organization’s network environment after documents containing host and user information, including metadata, were posted on a dark web brokerage site. Analysis confirmed that an unidentified threat actor compromised network administrator credentials through the account of a former employee—a technique commonly leveraged by threat actors—to successfully authenticate to an internal virtual private network (VPN) access point, further navigate the victim’s on-premises environment, and execute various lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) queries against a domain controller.[1] Analysis also focused on the victim’s Azure environment, which hosts sensitive systems and data, as well as the compromised on-premises environment. Analysis determined there were no indications the threat actor further compromised the organization by moving laterally from the on-premises environment to the Azure environment.CISA and MS-ISAC are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to provide network defenders with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor and methods to protect against similar exploitation of both unnecessary and privileged accounts.Download the PDF version of this report:TECHNICAL DETAILSNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 14. See the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actor’s activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK’s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping and CISA’s Decider Tool.OverviewA state government organization was notified that documents containing host and user information, including metadata, were posted on a dark web brokerage site. After further investigation, the victim organization determined that the documents were accessed via the compromised account of a former employee. Threat actors commonly leverage valid accounts, including accounts of former employees that have not been properly removed from the Active Directory (AD), to gain access to organizations.[1] CISA and MS-ISAC assessed that an unidentified threat actor likely accessed documents containing host and user information to post on the dark web for profit after gaining access through the account of a former employee.The scope of this investigation included the victim organization’s on-premises environment, as well as their Azure environment, which hosts sensitive systems and data. Analysis determined the threat actor did not move laterally from the compromised on-premises network to the Azure environment and did not compromise sensitive systems.Untitled Goose ToolIncident responders collected Azure and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) logs using CISA’s Untitled Goose Tool—a free tool to help network defenders detect potentially malicious activity in Microsoft Azure, Azure Active Directory (AAD), and Microsoft 365 (M365) environments. CISA developed the Untitled Goose Tool to export and review AAD sign-in and audit logs, M365 unified audit logs (UAL), Azure activity logs, and MDE data. By exporting cloud artifacts, Untitled Goose Tool supports incident response teams with environments that do not ingest logs into a security information and event management (SIEM) tool.Threat Actor ActivityThe logs revealed the threat actor first connected from an unknown virtual machine (VM) to the victim’s on-premises environment via internet protocol (IP) addresses within their internal VPN range. CISA and MS-ISAC assessed that the threat actor connected to the VM through the victim’s VPN [T1133] with the intent to blend in with legitimate traffic to evade detection.Initial Access: Compromised Domain AccountsUSER1: The threat actor gained initial access through the compromised account of a former employee with administrative privileges (USER1) [T1078.002] to conduct reconnaissance and discovery activities. The victim organization confirmed that this account was not disabled immediately following the employee’s departure.- The threat actor likely obtained theUSER1account credentials in a separate data breach due to the credentials appearing in publicly available channels containing leaked account information [T1589.001].USER1had access to two virtualized servers including SharePoint and the workstation of the former employee. The workstation was virtualized from a physical workstation using the Veeam Physical to Virtual (P2V) function within the backup software.USER2: The threat actor likely obtained theUSER2 account credentials from the virtualized SharePoint server managed byUSER1 [T1213.002]. The victim confirmed that the administrator credentials forUSER2 were stored locally on this server [T1552.001].- Through connection from the VM, the threat actor authenticated to multiple services [T1021] via theUSER1account, as well as from an additional compromised global domain administrator account (USER2) [T1078.002].- The threat actor’s use of theUSER2account was impactful due to the access it granted to both the on-premises AD and Azure AD [T1021.007], thus enabling administrative privileges [T1078.004].Following notification of the dark web posting, the victim organization immediately disabled theUSER1 account and took the two virtualized servers associated with the former employee offline. The victim also changed the password for theUSER2 account and removed administrator privileges. Neither of the administrative accounts had multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.LDAP QueriesThrough connection from the VM, the threat actor conducted LDAP queries of the AD, likely using the open source toolAdFind.exe, based on the format of the output. CISA and MS-ISAC assess the threat actor executed the LDAP queries [T1087.002] to collect user, host [T1018], and trust relationship information [T1482]. It is also believed the LDAP queries generated the text files the threat actor posted for sale on the dark web brokerage site:ad_users.txt,ad_computers.txt, andtrustdmp.txt.Table 1 lists all queries that were conducted between 08:39:43-08:40:56 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).|Query|Description|LDAP Search Scope: WholeSubtree, Base Object: dc=[REDACTED],dc=local, Search Filter: (objectCategory=CN=Person,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=[REDACTED],DC=local)|Collects names and metadata of users in the domain.|LDAP Search Scope: WholeSubtree, Base Object: dc=[REDACTED],dc=local, Search Filter: (objectCategory=CN=Computer,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=[REDACTED],DC=local)|Collects names and metadata of hosts in the domain.|LDAP Search Scope: WholeSubtree, Base Object: dc=[REDACTED],dc=local, Search Filter: (objectCategory=CN=Trusted-Domain,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=[REDACTED],DC=local)|Collects trust information in the domain.|LDAP Search Scope: WholeSubtree, Base Object: DC=[REDACTED],DC=local, Search Filter: ( & ( & (sAMAccountType=805306368) (servicePrincipalName=*) ( !

In all instances, the threat actor authenticated to the Common Internet File Service (CIFS) on various endpoints [T1078.002],[T1021.002]—a protocol used for providing shared access to files and printers between machines on the network. This was likely used for file, folder, and directory discovery [T1083], and assessed to be executed in an automated manner.USER1authenticated to four services, presumably for the purpose of network and service discovery [T1046].USER2authenticated to twelve services. Note: This account had administrative privileges to both the on-premises network and Azure tenant.MITRE ATT&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUESSee Tables 2-9 for all referenced threat actor’s tactics and techniques for enterprise environments in this advisory.

The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.Secure and Monitor Administrator AccountsThe threat actor gained access to the network via compromised administrator accounts that did not have MFA enabled. The compromisedUSER2 Global Domain Administrator account could have enabled the threat actor to move laterally from the on-premises environment to the Azure tenant. In response to the incident, the victim organization removed administrator privileges forUSER2. Additionally, the victim organization disabled unnecessary administrator accounts and enabled MFA for all administrator accounts. To prevent similar compromises, CISA and MS-ISAC recommend the following:- Review current administrator accounts to determine their necessity and only maintain administrator accounts that are essential for network management. This will reduce the attack surface and focus efforts on the security and monitoring of necessary accounts.- Restrict the use of multiple administrator accounts for one user.- Create separate administrator accounts for on-premises and Azure environments to segment access.- Implement the principle of least privilege to decrease threat actor’s ability to access key network resources. Enable just-in-time and just enough access for administrator accounts to elevate the minimum necessary privileges for a limited time to complete tasks.- Use phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) [CPG 2.H] (e.g., security tokens) for remote access and access to any sensitive data repositories. Implement phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible—particularly for webmail and VPNs—for accounts that access critical systems and privileged accounts that manage backups. MFA should also be used for remote logins [M1032]. For additional guidance on secure MFA configurations, visit CISA’s More than a Password webpage and read CISA’s Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA fact sheet.Reduce Attack SurfaceUnnecessary accounts, software, and services in the network create additional vectors for a threat actor to compromise. CISA and MS-ISAC recommend the following:- Establish policy and procedure for the prompt removal of unnecessary accounts and groups from the enterprise, especially privileged accounts. Organizations should implement a robust and continuous user management process to ensure accounts of offboarded employees are removed and can no longer access the network.- Maintain a robust asset management policy through comprehensive documentation of assets, tracking current version information to maintain awareness of outdated software, and mapping assets to business and critical functions.- Determine the need and functionality of assets that require public internet exposure [CPG 1.A].- Follow a routine patching cycle for all operating systems, applications, and software (including all third-party software) to mitigate the potential for exploitation.- Restrict personal devices from connecting to the network. Personal devices are not subject to the same group policies and security measures as domain joined devices.Evaluate Tenant SettingsBy default, in Azure AD all users can register and manage all aspects of applications they create. Users can also determine and approve what organizational data and services the application can access. These default settings can enable a threat actor to access sensitive information and move laterally in the network. In addition, users who create an Azure AD automatically become the Global Administrator for that tenant. This could allow a threat actor to escalate privileges to execute malicious actions. CISA and MS-ISAC recommend the following:- Evaluate current user permissions in the Azure tenant to restrict potentially harmful permissions including:- Restrict users’ ability to register applications. By default, all users in Azure AD can register and manage the applications they create and approve the data and services the application can access. If this is exploited, a threat actor can access sensitive information and move laterally in the network.- Restrict non-administrators from creating tenants. Any user who creates an Azure AD automatically becomes the Global Administrator for that tenant. This creates an opportunity for a threat actor to escalate privileges to the highest privileged account.- Restrict access to the Azure AD portal to administrators only. Users without administrative privileges cannot change settings, however, they can view user info, group info, device details, and user privileges. This would allow a threat actor to gather valuable information for malicious activities.Create a Forensically Ready Organization- Collect access- and security-focused logs (e.g., intrusion detection systems/intrusion prevention systems, firewall, data loss prevention, and virtual private network) for use in both detection and incident response activities [CPG 2.T].- Enable complete coverage of tools, including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), across the environment for thorough analysis of anomalous activity and remediation of potential vulnerabilities.Assess Security Configuration of Azure EnvironmentCISA created the Secure Cloud and Business Applications (SCuBA) assessment tool to help Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to verify that a M365 tenant configuration conforms to a minimal viable secure configuration baseline. Although the SCuBA assessment tool was developed for FCEB, other organizations can benefit from its output. CISA and MS-ISAC recommend the following:- Use tools that identify attack paths. This will enable defenders to identify common attack paths used by threat actors and shut them down before they are exploited.- Review the security recommendations list provided by Microsoft 365 Defender. Focus remediation on critical vulnerabilities on endpoints that are essential to mission execution and contain sensitive data.Evaluate Conditional Access PoliciesConditional access policies require users who want to access a resource to complete an action. Conditional access policies also account for common signals, such as user or group memberships, IP location information, device, application, and risky sign-in behavior identified through integration with Azure AD Identity Protection.- Review current conditional access policies to determine if changes are necessary.Reset All Passwords and Establish Secure Password PoliciesIn response to the incident, the victim organization reset passwords for all users.- Employ strong password management alongside other attribute-based information, such as device information, time of access, user history, and geolocation data. Set a password policy to require complex passwords for all users (minimum of 16 characters) and enforce this new requirement as user passwords expire [CPG 2.A],[CPG 2.B],[CPG 2.C].- Store credentials in a secure manner, such as with a credential manager, vault, or other privileged account management solution [CPG 2.L].- For products that come with default passwords, ask vendors how they plan to eliminate default passwords, as highlighted in CISA’s Secure by Design Alert: How Manufacturers Can Protect Customers by Eliminating Default Passwords.Mitigations for VendorsCISA recommends that vendors incorporate secure by design principles and tactics into their practices, limiting the impact of threat actor techniques and strengthening the secure posture for their customers.- Prioritize secure by default configurations, such as eliminating default passwords and providing high-quality audit logs to customers with no additional configuration, at no extra charge. Secure by default configurations should be prioritized to eliminate the need for customer implementation of hardening guidance.- Immediately identify, mitigate, and update affected products that are not patched in accordance with CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.- Implement multifactor authentication (MFA), ideally phishing-resistant MFA, as a default (rather than opt-in) feature for all products.VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLSIn addition to applying mitigations, CISA and MS-ISAC recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. CISA recommends testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory.To get started:- Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see table 2-9).- Align your security technologies against the technique.- Test your technologies against the technique.- Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance.- Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.- Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.CISA and MS-ISAC recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this advisory.RESOURCES- MS-ISAC: Center for Internet Security (CIS) Cyber-Attack Defense: CIS Benchmarks + CDM + MITRE ATT&CKREFERENCESDISCLAIMERThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

Bumblebee Malware Buzzes Back on the Scene After 4-Month Hiatus,"February 14, 2024The sophisticated Bumblebee loader is back in the threat landscape hive after a four-month hiatus, with a new email campaign targeting thousands of organizations in the US.Bumblebee, an initial access loader used by multiple cybercriminal groups to drop various payloads like infostealers, banking Trojans, and post-compromise tools, first appeared on the scene in March 2022. Until last October, threat actors relied on it heavily as a favored malware loader — and then it disappeared from researchers' radar.The loader was back in a campaign observed this month by the Proofpoint Threat Research Team, according to a blog post published Tuesday. The campaign employs several thousand emails with the subject ""Voicemail February,"" sent from the sender ""info@quarlesaa[.]com"" and containing malicious Microsoft OneDrive URLs.These URLs lead to a Word file with names such as ""ReleaseEvans#96.docm"" that spoof the consumer electronics company Humane. The attack vector eventually uses a PowerShell command to download and run a Bumblebee DLL file as an entry to further malicious activity, the researchers found.The return of the loader is a harbinger of things to come, Proofpoint researchers noted, as it ""aligns with a surge of cybercriminal threat activity after a notable absence of many threat actors and malware.""2024 ""has started off with a bang for cybercriminal threat actors, with activity returning to very high levels after a temporary winter lull,"" the researchers said. ""Proofpoint researchers continue to observe new, creative attack chains, attempts to bypass detections, and updated malware from many threat actors and unattributed threat clusters,"" adding that they expect this flurry of activity to continue until summer.Other malicious groups returning to action after a break include groups that the researchers track as post-exploitation operator TA582; aviation and aerospace-targeting actor TA2541; and email campaigns delivered by TA571 that deliver the DarkGate malware, among others.Bumblebee Malware's New and Noteworthy Flight PathThere are a couple of key aspects of the campaign that set it apart from previous attacks using Bumblebee. For instance, the campaign uses VBA macro-enabled documents, a tactic that's rarely used these days by threat actors since Microsoft began blocking macros by default in 2022 to thwart malicious activity, the researchers said.In the most recent campaign, the Word document used macros to create a script in the Windows temporary directory, which the macro then executed by using the ""wscript"" utility. Inside the dropped temporary file was a PowerShell command that downloaded and executed the next stage from a remote server, stored in a file called “update_ver."" The next stage was another PowerShell command, which in turn downloaded and ran the Bumblebee DLL.Interestingly, the attack chains used in Bumblebee's pre-hiatus campaigns were significantly different, the researchers noted. Previous campaigns sent emails that contained URLs leading to the download of a DLL which, if executed, started Bumblebee; or the emails contained HTML attachments that leveraged HTML smuggling to drop a RAR file that, if executed, exploited the WinRAR flaw CVE-2023-38831 to install Bumblebee.Other previous Bumblebee campaigns leveraged emails with zipped, password-protected VBS attachments which, if executed, used PowerShell to download and execute the loader, or emails that contained zipped LNK files to download an executable file that started Bumblebee.""Out of the nearly 230 Bumblebee campaigns identified since March 2022, only five used any macro-laden content; four campaigns used XL4 macros, and one used VBA macros,"" according to the researchers.Defenders BewareWhile Proofpoint has not attributed the recent Bumblebee campaign to any tracked threat actor — though the use of OneDrive URLs and sender address appear to align with previous TA579 activities. However, the firm included a list of indicators of compromise (IoC) to aid threat-hunting.The researchers also urged organizations to be on alert for the malicious email campaign hallmarks noted above, and said that they have assessed with ""high confidence"" that Bumblebee is being used ""as an initial access facilitator to deliver follow-on payloads such as ransomware.""Organizations can also employ basic security best practices to avoid compromise by malicious email campaigns, such as conducting employee training to help people identify phishing and other targeted scams, and implementing email security-scanning software that flags suspicious messages before they reach employee inboxes.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
OpenAI blocks state-sponsored hackers from using ChatGPT,"OpenAI has removed accounts used by state-sponsored threat groups from Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia, that were abusing its artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT.The AI research organization took action against specific accounts associated with the hacking groups that were misusing its large language model (LLM) services for malicious purposes after receiving key information from Microsoft's Threat Intelligence team.In a separate report, Microsoft provides more details on how and why these advanced threat actors used ChatGPT.Activity associated with the following threat groups was terminated on the platform:- Forest Blizzard (Strontium) [Russia]: Utilized ChatGPT to conduct research into satellite and radar technologies pertinent to military operations and to optimize its cyber operations with scripting enhancements.- Emerald Sleet (Thallium) [North Korea]: Leveraged ChatGPT for researching North Korea and generating spear-phishing content, alongside understanding vulnerabilities (like CVE-2022-30190 ""Follina"") and troubleshooting web technologies.- Crimson Sandstorm (Curium) [Iran]: Engaged with ChatGPT for social engineering assistance, error troubleshooting, .NET development, and developing evasion techniques.- Charcoal Typhoon (Chromium) [China]: Interacted with ChatGPT to assist in tooling development, scripting, comprehending cybersecurity tools, and generating social engineering content.- Salmon Typhoon (Sodium) [China]: Employed LLMs for exploratory inquiries on a wide range of topics, including sensitive information, high-profile individuals, and cybersecurity, to expand their intelligence-gathering tools and evaluate the potential of new technologies for information sourcing.Generally, the threat actors used the large language models to enhance their strategic and operational capabilities, including reconnaissance, social engineering, evasion tactics, and generic information gathering.None of the observed cases involve the use of LLMs for directly developing malware or complete custom exploitation tools.Instead, actual coding assistance concerned lower-level tasks such as requesting evasion tips, scripting, turning antivirus off, and generally the optimization of technical operations.In January, a report from the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) predicted that by 2025 the operations of sophisticated advanced persistent threats (APTs) will benefit from AI tools across the board, especially in developing evasive custom malware.Last year, though, according to OpenAI's and Microsoft's findings, there was an uplift in APT attack segments like phishing/social engineering, but the rest was rather exploratory.OpenAI says it will continue to monitor and disrupt state-backed hackers using specialized monitoring tech, information from industry partners, and dedicated teams tasked with identifying suspicious usage patterns.""We take lessons learned from these actors' abuse and use them to inform our iterative approach to safety,"" reads OpenAI's post.""Understanding how the most sophisticated malicious actors seek to use our systems for harm gives us a signal into practices that may become more widespread in the future, and allows us to continuously evolve our safeguards,"" the company added.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

Microsoft squashes security bugs under active exploitation,"Crims found and exploited these two Microsoft bugs before Redmond fixed 'emSAP, Adobe, Intel, AMD also issue fixes as well as Google for AndroidPatch Tuesday Microsoft fixed 73 security holes in this February's Patch Tuesday, and you better get moving because two of the vulnerabilities are under active attack.Of the whole bundle five are rated critical and two others, rated important and moderate threats, are the pair being exploited in the wild.First up: CVE-2024-21412, an internet shortcut file security feature bypass vulnerability that earned an 8.1-out-of-10 CVSS severity rating though Redmond only considers it important. After a user clicks on a maliciously crafted shortcut file on a vulnerable Windows machine, the file can start the next stage of an attack without causing security checks to appear on the screen.Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative researchers were among those to spot the bug and report it to Redmond. According to Trend’s researchers, a financially motivated gang it tracks as Water Hydra (aka DarkCasino) abused this bypass flaw to trick financial traders into ultimately infecting their PCs with DarkMe – a remote-access trojan seeded in forex trading forums and stock trading Telegram channels.This same crew previously used the WinRAR code execution vulnerability CVE-2023-38831 months before it was disclosed, again to target stock traders with the same malware. Shortly thereafter, Russian and Chinese crews joined in and The Register expects to see a similar pile-on with CVE-2024-21412. So patch this one ASAP.The second Microsoft vulnerability that's under active exploit (also rated moderate), CVE-2024-21351, is a Windows SmartScreen security feature bypass vulnerability that earned a 7.6 CVSS rating. We don't know who is exploiting this bug, nor how widespread the attacks are – Microsoft rarely provides any insight into either of these things.Windows uses Mark of the Web as a security feature to identify files downloaded from the internet, which when opened triggers a SmartScreen check. This SmartScreen bypass bug could allow an attacker to ""inject code into SmartScreen and potentially gain code execution, which could potentially lead to some data exposure, lack of system availability, or both,"" according to Redmond.Exploitation would turn SmartScreen on its own users, therefore.As for the critical flaws:- CVE-2024-21380: Microsoft Dynamics Business Central information disclosure, in that an authenticated user could trick a fellow user into clicking on a link that could lead to the leakage of account data and more.- CVE-2024-21410: Elevation of privilege in Microsoft Exchange Server, which can be exploited by a remote unauthenticated miscreant to impersonate users. Patching this requires extra steps.- CVE-2024-21413: Remote code execution in Microsoft Office, in that protected view can be bypassed leading ""to the leaking of local NTLM credential information and remote code execution.""- CVE-2024-20684: Denial-of-service in Windows Hyper-V.- CVE-2024-21357: Remote code execution in Windows Pragmatic General Multicast.The Zero Day Initiative has a full rundown here.Adobe February updatesAdobe released six patches that fix 29 vulnerabilities in its Commerce, Acrobat and Reader, FrameMaker Publishing Server, Audition, Substance 3D Painter, and Substance 3D Designer products.Two of the patches fix critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities present in Commerce and in Acrobat and Reader. Luckily, none of these CVEs appear to have been found, or exploited, before Adobe issued fixes.SAP stamps out 16 Security NotesSAP released 16 Security Notes – 13 of which are new and the other three representing updates to earlier patches. SAP has its own threat ranking system and labels two fixes as HotNews and six as High Priority Notes, with the rest being considered medium or low risk.The only fresh HotNews Note, #3420923, addresses a critical code injection vulnerability in cross-application component SAP_ABA that received a CVSS score of 9.1 out of ten.The other HotNews Note this month is a recurring fix for the most recent Chromium vulnerabilities (33 in total) for SAP Business Client.Intel fixes everythingIntel joined the February patch party with a whopping 35 advisories addressing 79 CVEs. None are rated critical, and none seem to have been exploited in the wild.Twenty of these vulnerabilities – including three high-rated bugs – are in Intel Thunderbolt Declarative Componentized Hardware drivers for Windows, and exploiting them could lead to escalation of privileges by an attacker, denial of service, and/or information disclosure.- QNAP vulnerability disclosure ends up an utter shambles- Double trouble for Fortinet as it issues critical FortiSIEM vulns- Ivanti releases patches for VPN zero-days, discloses two more high-severity vulns- ALPHV blackmails Canadian pipeline after 'stealing 190GB of vital info'Intel also sounded the alarm on three high-rated escalation of privilege vulnerabilities in some Arm Development Studio for Intel System-on-a-Chip FPGA software. There's also one high-rated improper access control flaw in some Intel PROSet/Wireless and Intel Killer Wi-Fi software that may allow an unauthenticated user to cause a denial of service attack via local access.We should also mention: AMD has patched a flaw in the RSA authentication mechanism of its UltraScale and UltraScale+ FPGAs, which can be exploited to inject unauthorized bitstreams into arrays; two SEV firmware vulnerabilities that potentially affect the security of guest VMs on shared hosts; four low-level processor holes, the worst of which could result in privilege escalation; and 20 flaws in its embedded CPU products.Cisco updates some earlier alertsCisco, so far this month, has issued four security advisories addressing six CVEs. This includes an updated fix for CVE-2024-20290 – a 7.5-rated vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition.And yesterday, the networking giant updated an advisory addressing three vulnerabilities – collectively rated 9.6 – in the Cisco Expressway series unified comms kit. The flaws could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery infiltration.And … AndroidFinally, earlier this month Google addressed about 30 CVEs in its February Android security bulletin.The most serious of the bunch, CVE-2024-0031, is ""a critical security vulnerability in the System component that could lead to remote code execution with no additional execution privileges needed,"" the Chocolate Factory warned. ®",security updates and patches,vulnerability reports,FALSE

"Microsoft, OpenAI: Nation-States Are Weaponizing AI in Cyberattacks","February 14, 2024Advanced persistent threats (APTs) aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia are all using large language models (LLMs) to enhance their operations.New blog posts from OpenAI and Microsoft reveal that five major threat actors have been using OpenAI software for research, fraud, and other malicious purposes. After identifying them, OpenAI shuttered all their accounts.Though the prospect of AI-enhanced nation-state cyber operations might at first seem daunting, there is good news: none of these LLM abuses observed so far have been particularly devastating.""Current use of LLM technology by threat actors revealed behaviors consistent with attackers using AI as another productivity tool,"" Microsoft noted in its report. ""Microsoft and OpenAI have not yet observed particularly novel or unique AI-enabled attack or abuse techniques resulting from threat actors' usage of AI.""The Nation-State APTs Using OpenAIThe nation-state APTs using OpenAI today are among the world's most notorious.Consider the group Microsoft tracks as Forest Blizzard, but is better known as Fancy Bear. The Democratic National Committee-hacking, Ukraine-terrorizing, Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU)-affiliated military unit has been using LLMs for basic scripting tasks — file manipulation, data selection, multiprocessing, and so on — as well as intelligence gathering, researching satellite communication protocols, and radar imaging technologies, likely as they pertain to the ongoing war in Ukraine.Two Chinese state actors have been ChatGPT-ing lately: Charcoal Typhoon (aka Aquatic Panda, ControlX, RedHotel, BRONZE UNIVERSITY), and Salmon Typhoon (aka APT4, Maverick Panda).The former has been making good use of AI for both pre-compromise malicious behaviors, gathering information about specific technologies, platforms, and vulnerabilities, generating and refining scripts, and generating social engineering texts in translated languages as well as post-compromise, performing advanced commands, achieving deeper system access, and gaining control in systems.Salmon Typhoon has primarily focused on LLMs as an intelligence tool, sourcing publicly available information about high-profile individuals, intelligence agencies, internal and international politics, and more. It has also largely unsuccessfully attempted to abuse OpenAI for help developing malicious code, and researching stealth tactics.Iran's Crimson Sandstorm (Tortoiseshell, Imperial Kitten, Yellow Liderc) is using OpenAI to develop phishing material –— emails pretending to be from an international development agency, for example, or a feminist group — as well as code snippets to aid their operations for web scraping, executing tasks when users sign in to an app, and so on.Finally there's Kim Jong-Un's Emerald Sleet (Kimsuky, Velvet Chollima) which, like the other APTs, turns to OpenAI for basic scripting tasks, phishing content generation, and researching publicly available information on vulnerabilities, as well as experts, think tanks, and government organizations concerned with defense issues and its nuclear weapons program.AI Isn't Game Changing (Yet)If these many malicious uses of AI seem useful, but not science fiction-level cool, there's a reason why.""Threat actors that are effective enough to be tracked by Microsoft are likely already proficient at writing software,"" Joseph Thacker, principal AI engineer and security researcher at AppOmni explains. ""Generative AI is amazing, but it's mostly helping humans be more efficient rather than making breakthroughs. I believe those threat actors are using LLMs to write code (like malware) faster, but it's not noticeably impactful because they already had malware. They still have malware. It's possible they're able to be more efficient, but at the end of the day, they aren't doing anything new yet.""Though cautious not to overstate its impact, Thacker warns that AI still offers advantages for attackers. ""Bad actors will likely be able to deploy malware at a larger scale or on systems they previously didn't have support for. LLMs are pretty good at translating code from one language or architecture to another. So I can see them converting their malicious code into new languages they previously weren't proficient in,"" he says.Further, ""if a threat actor found a novel use case, it could still be in stealth and not detected by these companies yet, so it's not impossible. I have seen fully autonomous AI agents that can 'hack' and find real vulnerabilities, so if any bad actors have developed something similar, that would be dangerous.""For those reasons he adds, simply, that ""Companies can remain vigilant. Keep doing the basics right.""About the Author(s)You May Also Like",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
DoJ Breaks Russian Military Botnet in Fancy Bear Takedown,"February 15, 2024The Department of Justice (DoJ) has disrupted a botnet used by Russian military intelligence for widespread cyber espionage.The network was made up of hundreds of individual small office/home office (SOHO) routers that the Russian Military Unit 26165 (better known as Fancy Bear, APT 28, Sofacy Group, Forest Blizzard, Pawn Storm, and Sednit) was able to use to launch cybercrimes, including spear-phishing, credential harvesting, and more, according to the DoJ.And unlike other custom-code networks typically used by Russian state-affiliated threat actors, this one was built on existing malware, called Moobot, linked to other known cybercriminal actors, the Justice Department said in its statement.""Non-GRU cybercriminals installed the Moobot malware on Ubiquiti Edge OS routers that still used publicly known default administrator passwords,"" the DoJ explained. ""GRU hackers then used the Moobot malware to install their own bespoke scripts and files that repurposed the botnet, turning it into a global espionage platform.""US law enforcement was able to use the Moobot malware to hack into compromised routers, copy and delete stolen data, remove malicious files, regain full device control, as well as block any remote access, according to the DoJ.The US government said affected Ubiquiti US Edge OS routers were disconnected from the Moobot networks and that any changes made to devices are temporary. The DoJ urges users to complete a factory reset on affected routers and update the default administrator passwords.Value in Slowing Down Espionage EffortsDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco noted this is the second time in two months the DoJ has disrupted a state-sponsored botnet. Jeff Hultquist, chief analyst with Mandiant Intelligence-Google Cloud, said that while this operation alone is unlikely to have a significant impact on Russian cyber-espionage operations, there is value in slowing their efforts with these disruptions.""These actions aren't a panacea and this actor will be back with a new scheme soon, but as elections loom, it's never been a better time to add friction to GRU operations,"" Hultquist explained in a statement. ""The hack and leak operations they have carried out may be the most effective cyberattack on elections we've witnessed, and we have no reason to believe they won't replay this tactic again.""About the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
Ransomware Wave at Romanian Hospitals Tied to Healthcare App,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Threat actors first infected the Hipocrate Information System with a variant of the Phobos ransomware family — and then it spread across the nation's healthcare organizations.February 14, 2024A rapidly spreading ransomware infection plaguing some 100 hospitals and medical facilities and hospitals in Romania started with an infection at a third-party healthcare platform provider.The Romanian National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) said the ransomware originated from Hipocrate Information System (HIS), an integrated healthcare management system platform that is sold by Romanian Soft Company (RSC).Romania's Pitesi Pediatric Hospital was the first known victim of the domino-effect cyberattack on Feb. 10, and the other hospitals were hit on Feb. 11 and Feb. 12. The unidentified attackers dropped the Backmydata malware — a relative of the Phobos ransomware family — and demanded 3.5 BTC or 157,000 euro.""Most of the affected hospitals have data backups from the affected servers, with data saved relatively recently (1-2-3 days ago) except for one, whose data was saved 12 days ago.

Bumblebee malware is back after four months of darkness,"Bumblebee malware wakes from hibernation, forgets what year it is, attacks with macrosTrying to break in with malicious Word documents? How very 2015 of youThe Bumblebee malware loader seemingly vanished from the internet last October, but it's back and - oddly - relying on a vintage vector to try and gain access.First spotted in 2022 by researchers at Proofpoint – who identified it as an apparent replacement for BazarLoader – Bumblebee was originally used by high-profile ransomware groups including Russia-linked Conti.Now it has been spotted buzzing back to life. But it's using a ""significantly different"" attack chain this time – relying on malicious VBA macros, of all things, which suggests it might not be in the hands of the same skilled operators who created it.This latest Bumblebee campaign has been targeting organizations in the US with emails using the subject line ""Voicemail February"" and sent from info@quarlesaa.com.The quarlesaa domain appears to belong to an actual business, which is reflected in the sample email lure included in the report. We've asked to see if the owner is aware that its email system is being used to send malicious emails but haven't heard back.Contained in the email is a link to a OneDrive URL, where a Microsoft Word document is. The doc is entirely unrelated to the sender – the sample shows a mission statement for Humane, developer of an AI-powered pin – but has the malicious macro embedded within.It's been more than a year since Microsoft updated its products to block VBA macros by default in a bid to cut off their use as a malicious attack vector. As the security team itself noted last May, the cyber criminal ecosystem underwent a ""monumental shift"" after Redmond's decision – quickly moving to different types of attacks.Not so this latest campaign, which puts it at odds with other Bumblebee flights. Out of nearly 230 uses of Bumblebee since March 2022, Proofpoint said only five campaigns used macros – four of which relied on XL4 in Excel, while just one relied on VBA.The rest of the intrusion attempts have used more evolved tactics – like malicious DLLs, HTML smuggling to drop RAR files, LNK files and zipped VBS attachments. Those are more akin to tactics Exotic Lily – an initial access broker tracked by Google's Threat Analysis Group – was using with Bumblebee in 2022.If, somehow, a victim's system had re-enabled Word macros by default and this Bumblebee chain managed to trigger – which the security group told The Register it hasn't actually seen in the wild – the macro would create a script in the Windows temp directory that ran a series of PowerShell commands to download and run the Bumblebee DLL.""We cannot say what the follow-on payload would be in this campaign, however historically Proofpoint has previously observed Bumblebee dropping Cobalt Strike, shellcode, and Sliver among other malware,"" Proofpoint senior threat intelligence analyst Selena Larson told us in an emailed statement.This one should be easy to spotIndicators of compromise are included in the report on this Bumblebee resurgence campaign. But let's be realistic – such an outmoded attack shouldn't be a threat anymore, not to mention the mish-mash of themes in the email and the very basic malicious attachment.""The URL in the email went to a document that was not related to a voicemail theme, which may appear unusual or possibly malicious to an end user,"" Larson told us. ""Organizations should train users to recognize potentially suspicious activity based on commonly observed themes and lures, and report to security teams when observed.""- Malware loader lowdown: The big 3 responsible for 80% of attacks so far this year- Microsoft took its macros and went home, so miscreants turned to Windows LNK files- Google password resets not enough to stop these info-stealing malware strains- Malvertising attacks are distributing .NET malware loadersBeyond that, the usual advice of keeping Windows and Microsoft Office installations up to date applies, as does making sure macros are disabled by default and ensuring none of your savvier users have taken it upon themselves to re-enable them.Unsurprisingly, Proofpoint doesn't think this campaign is linked to a tracked threat actor – despite the fact that the voicemail lure, use of OneDrive, and sender email address align with previous activity from the North Korean-aligned TA579, which has been behind previous Bumblebee campaigns.Regardless of this threat, Proofpoint said Bumblebee's return is indicative of a surge in threat actor activity so far in 2024. Even if this campaign is a bit janky, they won't all be.""Proofpoint researchers continue to observe new, creative attack chains, attempts to bypass detections, and updated malware from many threat actors and unattributed threat clusters,"" it warned.

Critical Exchange Server Flaw (CVE-2024-21410) Under Active Exploitation,"Microsoft on Wednesday acknowledged that a newly disclosed critical security flaw in Exchange Server has been actively exploited in the wild, a day after it released fixes for the vulnerability as part of its Patch Tuesday updates.Tracked as CVE-2024-21410 (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue has been described as a case of privilege escalation impacting the Exchange Server.""An attacker could target an NTLM client such as Outlook with an NTLM credentials-leaking type vulnerability,"" the company said in an advisory published this week.""The leaked credentials can then be relayed against the Exchange server to gain privileges as the victim client and to perform operations on the Exchange server on the victim's behalf.""Successful exploitation of the flaw could permit an attacker to relay a user's leaked Net-NTLMv2 hash against a susceptible Exchange Server and authenticate as the user, Redmond added.The tech giant, in an update to its bulletin, revised its Exploitability Assessment to ""Exploitation Detected,"" noting that it has now enabled Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) by default with the Exchange Server 2019 Cumulative Update 14 (CU14) update.Details about the nature of the exploitation and the identity of the threat actors that may be abusing the flaw are currently unknown. However, Russian state-affiliated hacking crews such as APT28 (aka Forest Blizzard) have a history of exploiting flaws in Microsoft Outlook to stage NTLM relay attacks.Earlier this month, Trend Micro implicated the adversary to NTLM relay attacks targeting high-value entities at least since April 2022. The intrusions targeted organizations dealing with foreign affairs, energy, defense, and transportation, as well as those involved with labor, social welfare, finance, parenthood, and local city councils.CVE-2024-21410 adds to two other Windows flaws – CVE-2024-21351 (CVSS score: 7.6) and CVE-2024-21412 (CVSS score: 8.1) – that have been patched by Microsoft this week and actively weaponized in real-world attacks.The exploitation of CVE-2024-21412, a bug that enables a bypass of Windows SmartScreen protections, has been attributed to an advanced persistent threat dubbed Water Hydra (aka DarkCasino), which has previously leveraged zero-days in WinRAR to deploy the DarkMe trojan.""The group used internet shortcuts disguised as a JPEG image that, when selected by the user, allows the threat actor to exploit CVE-2024-21412,"" Trend Micro said. ""The group can then bypass Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and fully compromise the Windows host as part of its attack chain.""Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update also addresses CVE-2024-21413, another critical shortcoming affecting the Outlook email software that could result in remote code execution by trivially circumventing security measures such as Protected View.Codenamed MonikerLink by Check Point, the issue ""allows for a wide and serious impact, varying from leaking of local NTLM credential information to arbitrary code execution.""The vulnerability stems from the incorrect parsing of ""file://"" hyperlinks, which makes it possible to achieve code execution by adding an exclamation mark to URLs pointing to arbitrary payloads hosted on attacker-controlled servers (e.g., ""file:///\\10.10.111.111\test\test.rtf!something"").""The bug not only allows the leaking of the local NTLM information, but it may also allow remote code execution and more as an attack vector,"" the cybersecurity firm said.

In typical Black Basta fashion, it dumped a plethora of the data it stole online, including identity documents and HR files, among others.The information revealed in this initial data dump was enough to verify through simple means that the documents were genuine and affected both customers and employees.In a letter sent to customers already, seen by El Reg, Southern Water said names, dates of birth, national insurance numbers, bank account numbers, sort codes, and payment reference numbers may have been stolen. This data was all visible online from the beginning.It's understood that customers will be sent different versions of the letter depending on the data believed to be stolen. Affected individuals have also been offered a free 12-month Experian Identity Plus membership for credit monitoring.Per the utility's website, it provides water services to 2.5 million customers and wastewater services to more than 4.7 million customers. It means that if the quoted 5 percent to 10 percent range is accurate, then hundreds of thousands of customers will potentially be receiving letters from the company soon, informing them that their data was stolen.Offering some comfort, Southern Water's latest statement confirmed that the third-party investigators called in to analyze the incident found no new evidence that data was further published online.""We are very sorry that this has happened,"" the biz said.""Throughout this process we have been working with Government, our regulators, and the National Cyber Security Centre. We have also notified the police and the Information Commissioner's Office.- Bumblebee malware wakes from hibernation, forgets what year it is, attacks with macros- Australian Tax Office probed 150 staff over social media refund scam- Crims found and exploited these two Microsoft bugs before Redmond fixed 'em- Just one bad packet can bring down a vulnerable DNS server thanks to DNSSEC""Since the incident, our IT security teams have worked with independent incident response experts, using enhanced monitoring and protection tools to check actively for any suspicious activity on our IT estate. Southern Water's operations and services to customers have not been impacted.""Further updates will be posted on our website and social media channels as we know more. Please be assured that if at any point we have reason to believe your data may be impacted, we will notify you, in line with our regulatory obligations.""At the time of writing, Black Basta appears to have removed its post about Southern Water from its leak blog.Usually this is only done when a victim pays a ransom. We asked Southern Water about this but it declined to comment.Critical infrastructure has long been a target for ransomware groups given the severe disruption to civil society an outage could potentially cause.The water and wastewater sectors have become an increasingly targeted subset of these critical organizations over the past year, an observation that prompted national cybersecurity agencies such as CISA and the UK NCSC to publish advisories highlighting the ongoing threat.One of the most serious examples recently came in November when a Pennsylvania water authority was attacked by Cyber Aveng3rs, a group experts believe to be Iran-aligned attackers.Programmable logic controllers were targeted and displayed anti-Israel messaging, which also explained that compromising Israel-manufactured technology would be an ongoing goal for the group.Now-shuttered Conti also semi-mistakenly claimed an attack on Thames Water in 2022, but actually breached South Staffordshire – parent of South Staffs Water and Cambridge Water. ®",data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,TRUE
"Microsoft, OpenAI Warn of Nation-State Hackers Weaponizing AI for Cyber Attacks","Nation-state actors associated with Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China are experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) to complement their ongoing cyber attack operations.The findings come from a report published by Microsoft in collaboration with OpenAI, both of which said they disrupted efforts made by five state-affiliated actors that used its AI services to perform malicious cyber activities by terminating their assets and accounts.""Language support is a natural feature of LLMs and is attractive for threat actors with continuous focus on social engineering and other techniques relying on false, deceptive communications tailored to their targets' jobs, professional networks, and other relationships,"" Microsoft said in a report shared with The Hacker News.While no significant or novel attacks employing the LLMs have been detected to date, adversarial exploration of AI technologies has transcended various phases of the attack chain, such as reconnaissance, coding assistance, and malware development.""These actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks,"" the AI firm said.For instance, the Russian nation-state group tracked as Forest Blizzard (aka APT28) is said to have used its offerings to conduct open-source research into satellite communication protocols and radar imaging technology, as well as for support with scripting tasks.Some of the other notable hacking crews are listed below -- Emerald Sleet (aka Kimusky), a North Korean threat actor, has used LLMs to identify experts, think tanks, and organizations focused on defense issues in the Asia-Pacific region, understand publicly available flaws, help with basic scripting tasks, and draft content that could be used in phishing campaigns.- Crimson Sandstorm (aka Imperial Kitten), an Iranian threat actor who has used LLMs to create code snippets related to app and web development, generate phishing emails, and research common ways malware could evade detection- Charcoal Typhoon (aka Aquatic Panda), a Chinese threat actor which has used LLMs to research various companies and vulnerabilities, generate scripts, create content likely for use in phishing campaigns, and identify techniques for post-compromise behavior- Salmon Typhoon (aka Maverick Panda), a Chinese threat actor which has used LLMs to translate technical papers, retrieve publicly available information on multiple intelligence agencies and regional threat actors, resolve coding errors, and find concealment tactics to evade detectionMicrosoft said it's also formulating a set of principles to mitigate the risks posed by the malicious use of AI tools and APIs by nation-state advanced persistent threats (APTs), advanced persistent manipulators (APMs), and cybercriminal syndicates and conceive effective guardrails and safety mechanisms around its models.""These principles include identification and action against malicious threat actors' use notification to other AI service providers, collaboration with other stakeholders, and transparency,"" Redmond said.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

Cybersecurity Tactics FinServ Institutions Can Bank On in 2024,"The landscape of cybersecurity in financial services is undergoing a rapid transformation. Cybercriminals are exploiting advanced technologies and methodologies, making traditional security measures obsolete. The challenges are compounded for community banks that must safeguard sensitive financial data against the same level of sophisticated threats as larger institutions, but often with more limited resources.The FinServ Threat LandscapeRecent trends show an alarming increase in sophisticated cyber-attacks. Cybercriminals now deploy advanced techniques like deep fake technology and AI-powered attacks, making it increasingly difficult for banks to differentiate between legitimate and malicious activities. These developments necessitate a shift towards more sophisticated and adaptive cybersecurity measures. Take these industry statistics, for example.- Financial firms report 703 cyberattack attempts per week.1- On average, 270 attacks (entailing unauthorized access of data, applications, networks, or devices) occurred in financial services, an increase of 31% compared with the prior year.2- On average, financial services businesses take an average of 233 days to detect and contain a data breach.3- 43% of senior bank executives don't believe their bank is adequately equipped to protect customer data, privacy, and assets in the event of a cyberattack.4- The average data breach cost in financial services is $5.72 million per incident.5State-sponsored cyberattacks also pose a unique threat to the financial sector. These attacks are often highly sophisticated and well-funded, aimed at destabilizing financial systems or stealing sensitive economic information. Community banks must be prepared to defend against these high-level threats, which require a different approach than conventional cybercriminal activities.Similarly, in recent times, there has been a concerning trend where major service providers catering to small-medium-sized banks, such as FIS, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, have become prime targets for cyber-attacks. Targeting these service providers allows threat actors to widen their net and make their attempts more efficient, as compromising a single service provider can potentially provide access to multiple small banks. This underscores the critical importance of strong vendor management governance. Community banks must be prepared to defend against these high-level threats, which require a different approach than conventional cybercriminal activities.Proactive measures can be taken to overcome the threats facing the FinServ industry. Companies like ArmorPoint provide complimentary Cybersecurity Workshops where they have seasoned cybersecurity experts identify specific security gaps and produce recommendations to mitigate those risks.Top 5 FinServ Cybersecurity Challenges and How to Overcome Them1. Advanced Cloud Security StrategiesCloud computing, with its numerous benefits of scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, is increasingly being adopted by financial institutions. However, this shift introduces specific security concerns that can be challenging to manage. The complexity of cloud security stems from the need to protect data across diverse and dynamic environments. In the cloud, data often moves across various services and geographies, making traditional perimeter-based security approaches less effective. Additionally, the shared responsibility model in cloud computing can lead to ambiguity in security roles and responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the bank.To address these challenges, banks must adopt advanced cloud security strategies. This involves implementing comprehensive data encryption to protect data at rest and in transit, and robust identity and access management systems to control who can access what data and under what conditions. Zero-trust security models, where trust is never assumed and verification is required from everyone trying to access resources in the network, are increasingly vital. Understanding the nuances of different cloud environments—public, private, and hybrid—is also key to tailoring security measures effectively.2. Ransomware: Beyond Basic DefenseRansomware attacks in the financial sector have become increasingly sophisticated, leveraging tactics like ""Ransomware as a Service"" (RaaS) to target institutions. The evolving nature of ransomware, combined with the high value of financial data, makes these institutions particularly vulnerable. Traditional defense strategies are often inadequate in the face of such advanced threats, which can bypass standard security measures and encrypt critical data, causing operational disruptions and financial losses.Banks need to implement a multi-layered defense strategy against ransomware. This includes advanced threat intelligence systems that can provide real-time insights into emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Regular security audits are crucial to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the bank's cybersecurity infrastructure. Additionally, proactive threat hunting teams can play a critical role in identifying and neutralizing threats before they materialize, providing an additional layer of defense against ransomware attacks.3. Comprehensive Vendor Risk ManagementFinancial institutions increasingly rely on third-party vendors for a range of services, from cloud computing to customer relationship management. Each vendor relationship introduces potential cybersecurity risks, as vendors may have access to or manage sensitive bank data. Managing these risks is complicated by the differing security postures and practices of various vendors, making it challenging to ensure consistent security standards across all third-party relationships.Effective vendor risk management goes beyond initial security assessments and requires continuous monitoring and evaluation of vendor security practices. Regular security audits of vendors are essential to ensure they adhere to agreed-upon security standards and practices. Integrating vendor risk management into the bank's overall cybersecurity strategy ensures a unified approach to security, reducing the likelihood of vendor-related security breaches.4. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating a Complex LandscapeThe regulatory landscape for cybersecurity in the financial sector is intricate and constantly evolving. Banks are required to comply with a wide range of international, national, and regional regulations, each with its own set of requirements and penalties for non-compliance. Navigating this complex landscape is challenging, as banks must continually adapt their cybersecurity strategies to meet these evolving requirements.To effectively navigate this landscape, community banks must develop a deep understanding of relevant regulations, such as the GBLA, PCI DSS, SOX, and more. This involves establishing a dedicated compliance team, or even utilizing a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO), responsible for staying abreast of regulatory changes and ensuring that the bank's cybersecurity practices align with these requirements. Regular training and awareness programs for all staff are also crucial to ensure widespread understanding and adherence to compliance requirements.5. Bridging the Cybersecurity Talent GapThe cybersecurity talent gap poses a significant challenge for financial institutions. The rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats requires skilled professionals who are up to date with the latest technologies and strategies. However, there is a shortage of such professionals in the market, making it difficult for banks to recruit and retain the talent needed to effectively manage their cybersecurity risks.Banks must adopt creative solutions to bridge this talent gap. Developing internal training programs can help upskill existing staff, making them capable of handling more complex cybersecurity tasks. Collaborating with educational institutions to develop tailored cybersecurity curriculums can help create a pipeline of skilled professionals. Additionally, leveraging AI and automation for routine security tasks can free up human resources for more complex and strategic cybersecurity challenges, optimizing the use of available talent.Furthermore, another viable strategy for addressing the talent gap is outsourcing. Financial institutions can consider outsourcing security operations talent, partnering with specialized firms to provide expert cybersecurity services. This approach allows banks to access a pool of seasoned professionals who can monitor, detect, and respond to security threats effectively. Additionally, outsourcing executive-level insights, such as a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO), can provide strategic guidance and governance to strengthen the bank's overall cybersecurity posture. By outsourcing specific talent needs, banks can bridge the talent gap more effectively while maintaining a strong focus on cybersecurity excellence.ArmorPoint has recently released a security maturity self-assessment. Take the 15-question quiz to determine the gaps in your security posture.Three Steps to Implement a Robust Cybersecurity FrameworkAn integrated approach to cybersecurity is imperative for effectively managing these diverse challenges. This involves creating a cohesive framework that combines advanced technology solutions, thorough policies and procedures, regular risk assessments, continuous monitoring, and proactive incident response planning.Step 1: Strategic Alignment and PlanningThe cornerstone of a successful cybersecurity program lies in its strategic alignment and planning. This critical first step involves setting clear cybersecurity goals that are closely aligned with the business objectives of the organization. Integration of security controls into the organizational strategy is essential, ensuring every business aspect is underpinned by robust security measures. An effective strategy also includes the creation of a risk prioritization framework, which is instrumental in identifying and focusing on the most critical threats. Furthermore, the development of a security architecture, tailored to the specific needs and risk profile of the organization, is crucial. This architecture needs to be dynamic, evolving in tandem with the changing landscape of cybersecurity threats and business requirements.Step 2: Risk-Centric Action and DeploymentThe second phase of developing a cybersecurity program is centered around risk-centric action and deployment. This involves establishing an efficient team structure, one that is dedicated to the meticulous implementation of the cybersecurity strategy. A key component of this phase is the deployment of the necessary tools and technologies that bring the strategic plan to life. Translating high-level strategies into actionable, practical steps is essential for effective execution. Strategic allocation of resources, especially in areas with higher perceived risks, ensures that critical aspects of the network are prioritized and reinforced. Moreover, the importance of continuous monitoring and management of security systems cannot be overstated, as they are vital for maintaining the efficacy of security measures and for addressing emergent threats swiftly.Step 3: Continuous Recalibration and OptimizationIn the final phase, the focus shifts to the continuous recalibration and optimization of the cybersecurity program. This phase demands maintaining accountability at all organizational levels and enhancing incident response capabilities to ensure swift and effective reactions to threats. Cultivating a culture that is aware of cybersecurity, through the education of employees and stakeholders about security best practices and risks, forms the bedrock of this phase. Regular evaluations and transparent communication of the program's effectiveness to key stakeholders are crucial for fostering an environment of continuous improvement. The cybersecurity strategies should be under constant review and refinement based on ongoing assessments. This adaptive approach ensures that cybersecurity measures remain both effective and relevant, aligning with the ever-evolving business environment and the shifting landscape of cyber threats.Preparing for Emerging Trends and Future ThreatsThe future of cybersecurity in the financial sector is likely to be shaped by emerging technologies and evolving threat landscapes.AI and Machine Learning in CybersecurityThe integration of AI and machine learning in cybersecurity tools is set to revolutionize threat detection and response. These technologies can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns indicative of cyber threats, offering a level of speed and efficiency unattainable by human analysts alone.The Role of Blockchain in Enhancing SecurityBlockchain technology has the potential to offer enhanced security features for financial transactions and data integrity. Its decentralized and immutable nature makes it an attractive option for securing transaction records and preventing fraud.Cyber threats are constantly evolving; community banks must stay vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts. Embracing comprehensive and integrated cybersecurity strategies, focusing on cyber resilience, and preparing for future technological advancements are key to safeguarding against the diverse and sophisticated threats in the cyber landscape. By staying ahead of these challenges, financial institutions can ensure the security and continuity of their operations, maintaining the trust and confidence of their customers.For more information about how you can enhance the security of your regional financial institution, explore ArmorPoint's solutions and experience the power of a unified approach to cybersecurity program management.Resources1 https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/check-point-research-cyber-attacks-increased-50-year-over-year/2 https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/state-cybersecurity3 https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/docs/research_reports/2021-Financial-Data-Risk-Report.pdf?hsLang=en4 https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2022/cybersecurity.html5 https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

Prudential Files Voluntary Breach Notice with SEC,"February 14, 2024Fresh on the heels of the Bank of America cyber compromise, another Fortune 500 giant is notably in the data breach crosshairs: Prudential Financial said this week that hackers cracked ""certain"" of its systems earlier in the month.The announcement also stands out for another reason: While corporations are now required to report cybersecurity incidents that have ""material"" impact to operations to the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), Prudential appears to have gotten out ahead of that new mandate with a voluntary incident disclosure, before any such impact has been determined.""It's great to see that Prudential Financial quickly detected and responded to the data breach, and our hope is that the attackers were stopped before any sensitive data was stolen, and that the impact to the business is minimal,"" says Joseph Carson, chief security scientist and advisory CISO at Delinea. For now though, those details are unclear.Cybercrime Gang Likely Behind Prudential's BreachIn a Form 8-K notice to the SEC, Prudential said that it detected unauthorized access to its infrastructure on Feb. 5. It determined that the threat actor, which the financial and insurance behemoth believes was an organized cybercrime group, had gained access the day before to ""administrative and user data from certain [IT] systems, and a small percentage of company user accounts associated with employees and contractors.""The company has kicked off its incident response, which is in the early stages; so far, it's unclear if the attackers accessed additional information or systems, heisted customer or client data, or if the incident will have a material impact on Prudential operations.With no evidence of any of those scenarios, Prudential isn't yet under a mandate to report the breach. Thus, researchers say the firm's SEC filing is indicative of what could be a new trend: proactive filings.We Don't Need to Do This — but We WillOn Dec. 15, the SEC incident-disclosure rules changed to require a Form 8-K to be filed within ""four business days of determining [a cyber] incident was material.""Claude Mandy, chief evangelist for data security at Symmetry Systems, notes that Prudential's move to file before fully identifying the materiality of the breach could be an effort to defang any extortion attempts by the assailants.The potential for weaponizing the new SEC regulations is evident in the case of MeridianLink, which opted to not negotiate with the ransomware group ALPHV (aka BlackCat) after a cyberattack. The gang responded by filing a formal complaint with the SEC, alleging that its recent victim failed to comply with new disclosure regulations.""The proactive holding statement by Prudential is indicative of the pressure being put on cybercrime victims by cybercriminals under this new incident reporting regime,"" Mandy says. ""It is a sign of a well-rehearsed incident response program.""He adds, ""cybercriminals can and will be threatening public disclosure of the incident to extort money from the victims. An early disclosure like this relieves that pressure, but it requires modern data security tools to determine the likely materiality of the incident.""Meanwhile, Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder at Keeper Security, said in an emailed statement that such voluntary reporting of cyber incidents could simply be a spin-doctoring effort, after seeing the fallout that Uber and SolarWinds execs suffered for not reporting incidents in a timely manner.""Prudential may be attempting to proactively mitigate reputational damage … this type of voluntary disclosure is likely motivated more by public relations than regulations,"" he noted.The incident also points up a glaring omission in federal law: There are no blanket federal data privacy statutes that require businesses to inform customers directly of real or potential data breaches, and no corresponding fines or sanctions in place that act as punitive deterrents. The feds have effectively relegated data privacy and protection to the states and sector-specific agency regulation; the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is one of the strictest protections, though critics complain CCPA doesn't go far enough.What sets the new SEC rule apart from other regulations is its requirement that publicly traded companies report such breaches within four days of determining material impact. In contrast, HIPAA gives healthcare entities 60 days for such notifications.Prudential did not immediately return a request for comment from Dark Reading. Mandy notes that for now, Prudential customers will just need to wait and see whether their information has been compromised in the breach.""As we’ve seen with other breaches, there may be further aspects to the incident that are uncovered as the investigation and fallout continues,"" Mandy says. ""The holding statement from Prudential indicates that based on what they know right now, they do not believe it meets their threshold for materiality. This threshold is determined by Prudential, based on whether the impact (in their view) would be material information to an investor or shareholder.""He adds, ""We hope to see more detailed analysis from Prudential as the investigation continues.""About the Author(s)You May Also Like",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
We're at a Pivotal Moment for AI and Cybersecurity,"February 14, 2024COMMENTARYCybersecurity has always been a cat-and-mouse game between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys."" With the growing prevalence of AI, including new forms like generative AI, this ongoing chess match has only grown more intense — and it's increasingly clear that AI will serve as the powerful ""queen"" that can tip the match in favor of whoever wields this piece most effectively.Cyberattacks Are More Sophisticated Than EverBad actors have wasted little time finding ways to incorporate generative AI into their activities. They've been able to take their phishing efforts to a whole new level: Messages now arrive as subtle, fluid prose, void of spelling errors or grammatical mistakes.A clever scammer can even ""prompt"" generative AI models to assume a persona to make the phishing email more convincing; for example, ""Make this email sound like it's coming from the accounting department of a Fortune 500 company"" or ""Imitate the writing style and mannerisms of executive X."" With this type of highly targeted, AI-honed phishing attack, bad actors increase their odds of stealing an employee's login credentials so they can access highly sensitive information, such as a company's financial details.Threat actors are also developing their own malevolent versions of mainstream GPT tools. DarkGPT, for example, is able to tap into all corners of the Dark Web, making it very easy to gather information and resources that can be put to nefarious ends. There's also FraudGPT, which enables cybercriminals to create malicious codes and viruses with just a few strokes of their keyboard. The result? Devastatingly efficient ransomware attacks that are easier than ever to launch, with a lowered barrier to entry.Unfortunately, as long as these illicit activities yield results, there will continue to be bad actors who seek creative ways to use new technologies like generative AI for sinister reasons. The good news is enterprises can leverage these very same capabilities to bolster their own security postures.Context Is KeyIn the same way that DarkGPT and FraudGPT can serve up harmful resources faster than ever before, a GPT tool deployed responsibly can serve up helpful resources — providing the context needed to help evade potential attacks and facilitate a more effective response to any threats.For example, let's say a security professional sees some irregular activity or anomalous behavior happening in their environment, but they're not sure what the next steps are for appropriate investigation or remediation. Generative AI can very quickly pull relevant information, best practices, and recommended actions from the collective intelligence of the security field. Having this comprehensive context allows practitioners to quickly understand the nature of the attack, as well as what respective actions they should take.This capability becomes particularly powerful when security teams can look at their environment holistically and analyze all of the data that's available.Seeing the Full PictureBefore, it was standard to observe a single system for normal behavior, or perhaps, more importantly, abnormal behavior. Now, it's possible to look across multiple systems and configurations — including how they're interacting together — to deliver a much more detailed picture of what's happening across the environment. As a result, professionals can have a much deeper, contextual understanding of the unfolding situation and make better, more informed decisions.Additionally, generative AI doesn't just help security professionals make better decisions, it also helps them make faster decisions — with less manual effort.Today, there's a lot of grunt work involved in gaining visibility across the technology stack and digital footprint within the organization, pulling data together, and trying to figure out what's happening. Given the scale and complexity of today's technology environments and the volumes of data involved, it's historically been impossible to provide a holistic security blanket or identify every single blind spot — and this is largely what bad actors are taking advantage of.Generative AI not only helps aggregate all of this data, it also democratizes it. This enables security professionals to perform analysis across massive amounts of information in near real-time and can identify potential threats based on landscape changes they previously might have only stumbled on by accident. This alone can reduce the dwell time of any bad actors from days to just minutes — a significant advantage for the good guys.There's Cause for OptimismAs automobiles became more common in the early 1900s, it was customary to have someone carrying a red flag on the road ahead of the car to provide advance warning to other travelers that something new and unexpected was coming, and to be aware of their surroundings.Obviously, society has long since acclimatized to having vehicles on the road. They've simply become part of the fabric of the world we live in, even as they've become increasingly sophisticated and powerful.When it comes to AI, we're at a red-flag moment: We need to proceed mindfully and carefully. Whether it's cars or AI, there is always some risk involved. But just as we've added more enhanced security features to vehicles and increased regulations, we can do the same with AI.Ultimately, there's cause for optimism here. The cat-and-mouse game between hackers and defenders will continue, as it always has. But in using AI, and generative AI in particular, as a way to strengthen their overall security posture and fortify their defenses, the good guys will be able to take their game up a notch and improve their ability to keep the bad guys where they belong: in check.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Volt Typhoon broke into emergency network of 'large' US city,"China's Volt Typhoon spies broke into emergency network of 'large' US cityJeez, not now, Xi. Can't you see we've got an election and Ukraine and Gaza and cost of living and layoffs and ...The Chinese government's Volt Typhoon spy team has apparently already compromised a large US city's emergency services network and has been spotted snooping around America's telecommunications' providers as well.According to a report on Tuesday by industrial cybersecurity biz Dragos, the crew has been conducting reconnaissance and enumeration of ""multiple"" American electric companies since early 2023. And, more recently, the Beijing spies have apparently targeted emergency management services, including telecommunications and satellite services.These are very strategic targets. It's not a spray and pray""The concern is the targets they pick across telecommunications, and electric power generation and distribution — these are very strategic targets. It's not a spray and pray,"" Dragos CEO Robert Lee said on a call with reporters.""It is specifically looking at those sites that would be of strategic value to an adversary trying to hurt or cripple US infrastructure.""Volt Typhoon surveilling energy and other critical infrastructure facilities isn't new — the Feds have been hammering this point for a while now. But the Dragos report suggests the pace of penetration is picking up.On the other hand, you may expect China by now to be all over US infrastructure just as much as Uncle Sam's NSA and CIA is probably all over Chinese networks. We're determined not to panic, in other words.In addition to the digital break-ins in the US, the Chinese Volt snoops have been targeting electric transmission and distribution organizations in Africa, we're told, a continent Beijing is rather keen on exploiting.Dragos tracks Volt Typhoon as Voltize, and here's what its incident responders and threat hunters have spotted over the past year [PDF]:- Early 2023: US territory of Guam compromise.- June 2023: Voltize infiltrates United States emergency management organization.- August 2023: Dragos discovers Voltize targeting African electric transmission and distribution providers.- November 2023: Dragos collaborated with E-ISAC on analysis of Voltize activity against multiple US-based electric sector organizations.- December 2023: Dragos discovered evidence that VOLTZITE has overlaps with UTA0178, a threat activity cluster tracked by Volexity, exploiting Ivanti ICS VPN zero-day vulnerabilities.- January 2024: Extensive reconnaissance of a US telecommunication's providers external network gateways.- January 2024: Evidence of compromise against a large US city's emergency services GIS network.In one of the instances where Volt Typhoon compromised a US electric company, the spies had been on the organization's IT network for ""well over 300 days"" before being spotted, according to Dragos' Lee.- US says China's Volt Typhoon is readying destructive cyberattacks- Is critical infrastructure prepared for OT ransomware?- We know nations are going after critical systems, but what happens when crims join in?- ALPHV blackmails Canadian pipeline after 'stealing 190GB of vital info'The attackers were ""explicitly trying to get into the operational technology network,"" he said. ""They were knocking on the door, they were doing everything that you'd expect to explicitly get into the power operations networks.""While they weren't able to infiltrate the operational technology, or OT, network, Volt Typhoon did manage to steal geographic information systems' data, ""things that would be useful in future disruptive attacks,"" Lee noted.Some of the devices and software the Chinese spies have compromised include Fortinet FortiGuard, PRTG Network Monitor appliances, ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, FatePipe WARP, Ivanti Connect Secure VPN, and Cisco ASA, according to the Dragos report.After gaining access to victims' IT networks, usually by exploiting buggy routers or VPN gateways, they use ""living off the land"" techniques (ie, legit admin tools to blend in) and stolen credentials to move laterally through the network. ®",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

"Feds go Fancy Bear hunting, take down Russia's GRU botnet","Feds dismantle Russian GRU botnet built on 1,000-plus home, small biz routersBeijing, now Moscow.… Who else is hiding in broadband gateways?The US government today said it disrupted a botnet that Russia's GRU military intelligence unit used for phishing expeditions, spying, credential harvesting, and data theft against American and foreign governments and other strategic targets.This latest court-authorized takedown happened in January, and involved neutralizing ""well over a thousand"" home and small business routers that had been infected with the Moobot malware, which is a Mirai variant, according to FBI Director Christopher Wray, speaking at the Munich Cyber Security Conference on Thursday. Moobot can be used to remote-control compromised devices and launch attacks against networks.Non-GRU cybercriminals installed Moobot on Ubiquiti Edge OS routers using publicly known default administrator passwords, we're told. Then the GRU spying team (tracked as APT 28, Forest Blizzard, and Fancy Bear among other names) used Moobot to install their own bespoke scripts and files that repurposed the botnet, thus ""turning it into a global cyber espionage platform,"" according to the Feds.Russian intelligence services turned to criminal groups to help them target home and office routers""Russian intelligence services turned to criminal groups to help them target home and office routers, but the Justice Department disabled their scheme,"" opined Attorney General Merrick Garland. ""We will continue to disrupt and dismantle the Russian government’s malicious cyber tools that endanger the security of the United States and our allies.""The botnet targeted organizations that are of interest to the Russian government, including US and foreign governments and military, security, and corporate organizations. In December Microsoft said the Fancy Bear crew had been exploiting two previously patched bugs for large-scale phishing campaigns against high-value targets such as government, defense, and aerospace agencies in the US and Europe, though didn't say if a botnet was used in the attacks.And earlier this week it emerged Kremlin agents had been caught misusing OpenAI's models to generate phishing emails and malicious software scripts.TakedownAccording to American prosecutors, the Feds were able to instruct the Moobot botnet to copy and delete malicious files – including the malware itself – and any stolen data on the compromised routers, likely similar to what the DOJ did with the recent Volt Typhoon KV botnet takedown.The FBI said [PDF] the dismantling of the Moobot network also involved modifying the routers' firewall rules to block remote management access to the devices, preventing them from being further hijacked, and ""enabled temporary collection of non-content routing information that would expose GRU attempts to thwart"" the operation.That is to say, Uncle Sam was able to prevent Russia's use of the botnet by firewalling off remote management access, scrubbed the malware from the routers, and also inspected the Kremlin's handiwork on the infect equipment. All this was carried out with the consent of the owners of infected equipment, we're told.Plus, the Feds said, users can rollback Uncle Sam's firewall rule changes via factory resets, or the routers' web-based user interface, though bear in mind a reset potentially leaves devices open to hijacking again if one doesn't change the admin password from the default.""A factory reset that is not also accompanied by a change of the default administrator password will return the router to its default administrator credentials, leaving the router open to reinfection or similar compromises,"" the Justice Department warned.- FBI confirms it issued remote kill command to blow out Volt Typhoon's botnet- Fancy Bear goes phishing in US, European high-value networks- OpenAI shuts down China, Russia, Iran, N Korea accounts caught doing naughty things- China's Volt Typhoon spies broke into emergency network of 'large' US cityThis is the second time in as many months that the Feds claim to have upended a state-sponsored botnet. The first, announced in January, belonged to China's Volt Typhoon, which had abused hundreds of outdated Cisco and Netgear boxes to break into energy facilities, emergency networks and other US critical infrastructure orgs.However, as Google's Mandiant Intelligence chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register, it's likely the Kremlin-backed crew ""will be back with a new scheme soon.""""As elections loom, it's never been a better time to add friction to GRU operations,"" he said.Fancy Bear is believed to have been behind intrusions into the US Democratic Party's computers during the 2016 US presidential race, and they have continued to try to disrupt elections ever since.""The hack and leak operations they have carried out may be the most effective cyberattack on elections we've witnessed, and we have no reason to believe they won't replay this tactic again,"" Hultquist said. ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Hamas Cyberattacks Ceased After the Oct. 7 Terror Attack. But Why?,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Hamas-linked threat actors have defied norms, with no discernible uptick in cyber operations prior to the group's attack in Israel — and a complete abandonment of them thereafter.February 14, 2024Cyber threat actors linked with Hamas have seemingly ceased activity ever since the terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, confounding experts.Combination warfare is old hat in 2024. As Mandiant said in a newly published report, cyber operations have become a ""tool of first resort"" for any nation or nation-aligned group around the world engaged in protracted conflict, be it political, economic, or warlike in nature. Russia's invasion of Ukraine — preceded and supported by historic waves of cyber destruction, espionage, and misinformation — is, of course, the quintessence.Not so in Gaza. If today's playbook is to support resource-intensive kinetic war with low-risk, low-investment cyber war, Hamas has thrown out the book.""What we saw all through September 2023 was very typical Hamas-linked cyber espionage activities — their activity was very consistent with what we've seen for years,"" Kristen Dennesen, threat intelligence analyst for Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), said in a press conference this week. ""That activity continued on until just before October 7 — there wasn't any kind of shift or uptick prior to that point. And since that time, we haven't seen any significant activity from these actors.""Failing to ramp up cyberattacks prior to Oct. 7 might be construed as strategic. But regarding why Hamas (irrespective of its supporters) has quit its cyber operations instead of using them to support its war effort, Dennesen admitted, ""We don't offer any explanation as to why because we don't know.""Hamas Pre-Oct. 7: 'BLACKATOM'Typical Hamas-nexus cyberattacks include ""mass phishing campaigns to deliver malware or to steal email data,"" said Dennesen, as well as mobile spyware via various Android backdoors dropped via phishing. ""And finally, in terms of their targeting: very persistent targeting of Israel, of Palestine, their regional neighbors in the Middle East, as well as targeting of the US and Europe,"" she explained.For a case study in what that looks like, take BLACKATOM — one of the three primary Hamas-linked threat actors, alongside BLACKSTEM (aka MOLERATS, Extreme Jackal) and DESERTVARNISH (aka UNC718, Renegade Jackal, Desert Falcons, Arid Viper).In September, BLACKATOM began a social engineering campaign aimed at software engineers in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), as well as Israel's defense and aerospace industries.The ruse involved posing as employees of companies on LinkedIn and messaging targets with fake freelance job opportunities. After initial contact, the false recruiters would send a lure document with instructions for participating in a coding assessment.The fake coding assessment required recipients to download a Visual Studio project, masquerading as a human resources management app, from an attacker-controlled GitHub or Google Drive page. Recipients were then asked to add features to the project, to demonstrate their coding skills. Contained within the project, though, was a function that secretly downloaded, extracted, and executed a malicious ZIP file on the affected computer. Inside the ZIP: the SysJoker multiplatform backdoor.'Nothing Like Russia'It may seem counterintuitive that Hamas' invasion wouldn't have been paired with a shift in its cyber activity akin to Russia's model. This may be due to its prioritization of operational security — the secrecy that made its Oct. 7 terror attack so shockingly effective.Less explicable is why the most recent confirmed Hamas-related cyber activity, according to Mandiant, occurred back on Oct. 4. (Gaza, meanwhile, has suffered from significant Internet disruptions in recent months.)""I think the key thing to draw out is that these are very different conflicts, with very different entities involved,"" said Shane Huntley, senior director at Google TAG. ""Hamas is nothing like Russia. And therefore, it's not surprising that the use of cyber is very different [depending on] the nature of the conflict, between standing armies versus a sort of attack like we saw on October 7.""But Hamas likely has not fully retired its cyber operations. ""While the outlook for future cyber operations by Hamas-linked actors is uncertain in the near term, we do anticipate that Hamas cyber activity will eventually resume. It should be focused on espionage for intelligence-gathering on these intra-Palestinian affairs, Israel, the United States, and other regional players in the Middle East,"" Dennesen noted.Read more about:DR Global Middle East & AfricaAbout the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

10 Security Metrics Categories CISOs Should Present to the Board,"Cybersecurity In-Depth: Feature articles on security strategy, latest trends, and people to know.Boards of directors don't care about a security program's minute technical details. They want to see how key performance indicators are tracked and used.February 14, 2024With the US Securities and Exchange Commission requiring CISOs and boards of directors to increase the level of transparency around their organizations' cybersecurity capabilities and to speed up breach disclosure to investors, cyber reporting and metrics have become an even bigger priority for companies this year.Boards are turning the screws to their security and risk executives to bring a lot more rigor to how they track key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs) — and how they use these metrics to advise and report to the board. Fundamental to both KPIs and KRIs are security operational metrics that track the scope of assets, cybersecurity activities around those assets, and measured security outcomes.""Security teams use operational metrics to track and report on cybersecurity activities and outcomes,"" explains The Cyber Savvy Boardroom, a recent primer published by a pair of longtime cyber-risk leaders to help directors and executive leaders wrap their arms around cyber issues. ""When shared with the board of directors’ risk or audit committees, these key performance indicators illuminate the organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and the efficiency of cyber controls while also helping the board of directors evaluate the adequacy of investments in technology and talent.""Co-authored by Homaira Akbari, CEO of global advisory firm AKnowledge Partners, and Shamla Naidoo, head of cloud strategy for Netskope, the book covers a lot of ground, but some of the most vital parts of the primer focus on metrics. Dark Reading summarizes and excerpts from the tome here to present the most common metrics that Akbari and Naidoo believe to be crucial for CISOs to track and share with the board in order to report on risk levels and security performance.The caveat, of course, is that security leaders need to be able to roll up these metrics into assessments and dashboards that are easy to digest. As explained in the primer, the metrics detailed in each category create a data-backed model for determining the efficacy of an organization's program and identifying gaps in protection.""The conclusions of these assessments should be summarized in several overall ratings and included in the company’s cybersecurity dashboard,"" Akbari and Naidoo explain.DataThese metrics should scope risk around data assets and track performance in key protection measures for data security, resilience, and continuity. Some of the metrics Akbari and Naidoo advise CISOs to track in this category include:% data centralized% data encryptedBackup frequencySpeed of data recovery% employee/customer/user info on Dark WebDepth of data-lake segmentationFinancial AssetsFinancial asset risks and losses are included in this grouping of metrics, which should give a measured feel for financial consequences from recent breaches. Some metrics the authors suggest tracking (based on past quarters or over the past year) include:Value of actual money/crypto lost directlyValue of money or productivity losses in form of ransomwareVolume of financial data leaked (accounts, credit cards, loyalty points, online banking credentials)While not specifically listed, data on financial losses from business email compromise (BEC) and indirect breach response costs would also be valuable to track.PeopleWhether it is falling prey to phishing or BEC attacks — exposing data by not following policy or exposing systems in other ways — people are usually an enterprise's biggest vulnerability. While it may be hard to measure the efficacy of security awareness training, there are some good proxies to get a general sense of how well an organization's people are adhering to security best practices and policies. The authors suggest the following metrics in this category:% phishing email click-through% suspicious email reportedPasswords hackedPrivileged accounts to total accounts% employees moving data/files out of the enterpriseOther metrics not directly mentioned but are still relevant include the results from phishing simulations, knowledge assessment scores, and behavioral or account data about high-risk individuals.SuppliersWith third-party risk management and the digital supply chain security on the forefront of many executives' minds in the wake of events like SolarWinds, boards will want to be informed of supplier-related security operations risks and performance levels. Akbari and Naidoo believe CISOs would do well to keep the business attuned to trending data and metrics around:Self-certification of cybersecurity posture of third partiesExternal scoring against peers and industryContinuous monitoring of posture of third and fourth partiesExternal audit compliancePenetration testing scores (from suppliers)Data about suppliers will likely have a lot of overlap with metrics about enterprise applications (see below), as application security teams start to look at software supply chain risk, including risky dependencies from third-party code and components.InfrastructureWhether on-premises or in the cloud, IT infrastructure exposures and security capabilities in mitigating risks across the network and hardware assets should be appropriately monitored and measured. Some operational data that the authors suggest in this category include metrics around:Number of servers/hardware approaching end of lifeSecure configurations of all assetsDepth of network/ infrastructure segmentationLevel of automation of inventory and control of hardware assetsVulnerability scanningDepth of zero-trust architecture deployment: identity, device, access, servicesUser-Controlled DevicesCISOs should be able to give board members a feel for the level of control their organizations have over shadow IT and other user-controlled devices operating on the network. Akbari and Naidoo say the following common metrics should be on the radar:Number of unidentified devices on the networkNumber of devices with unpatched softwareRate of false positivesNumber of threats detected and prevented by the endpoint solutionNew Technologies: IoTThe scope and scale of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has opened up significant risk to enterprises over the course of the past decade. The authors suggest that CISOs provide some risk metrics around these, including:Number of non-upgradable or patchable IoT devicesNumber of IoT ports connecting to enterprise networksDepth of loT segmentation from enterprise resourcesWhile the focus is currently on IoT, the same approach could work for all emerging technology. AI, for example, could include metrics around AI use and — with some emerging AI security tooling — risk exposure levels from AI use in the organization.Enterprise ApplicationsWhether it is from commercial software or applications developed in-house, applications present some of the biggest attack surfaces in the enterprise today. Akbari and Naidoo offer a couple of common metrics boards should be apprised of:Known open software vulnerabilitiesSoftware patches outstandingNumber of zero-day software vulnerabilitiesThere is no shortage of additional application security data and metrics that can help track performance and risk levels across application portfolios. Consider including data such as rate of automated versus manual code review, time to fix critical vulnerabilities, open rate of critical vulnerabilities, and metrics that add context about exploitability or business value of assets with known critical flaws.Testing Security PostureSecurity validation and testing is an important part of a security program, so CISOs should be beholden to track not only the results from security tests, but also the rate at which they conduct testing. Some metrics that fall into this category, according to Akbari and Naidoo, are:Penetration(red, blue) testingIndependent external security ratings versus peers and the industryInternal/external auditor report on regulatory and cyber complianceApplication and other testing scores and discoveriesIncident Detection and ResponseBoards of directors will be very interested in a security team's ability to detect and respond to incidents. Akbari and Naidoo recommend some of the following common ops metrics to track this:• Volumes and % of actual incidents versus intrusion attempts• Mean time to detect• Mean time to contain• Mean time to remediate/resolve• Red team scores and discoveriesAdditionally, CISOs may benefit from offering metrics and results from tabletop exercises and attack simulations if these are activities they engage in.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeEnterprises Worry End Users Will be the Cause of Next Major BreachFeb 16, 2024|2 Min Read10 Security Metrics Categories CISOs Should Present to the BoardFeb 14, 2024|6 Min ReadHow Changes in State CIO Priorities for 2024 Apply to API SecurityFeb 12, 2024|4 Min ReadWhy Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingFeb 8, 2024|5 Min Read",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE

Stolen iOS users face scans used to break into bank accounts,"Cybercriminals are stealing iOS users' face scans to break into mobile banking accountsDeepfake-enabled attacks against Android and iPhone users are netting criminals serious cashCybercriminals are targeting iOS users with malware that steals face scans from the users of Apple devices to break into and pilfer money from bank accounts – thought to be a world first.A Chinese-speaking cybercrime group, dubbed GoldFactory by Group-IB's researchers, started distributing trojanized smartphone apps in June 2023, however, the latest GoldPickaxe version has been around since October.GoldPickaxe and GoldPickaxe.iOS target Android and iOS respectively, tricking users into performing biometric verification checks that are ultimately used to bypass the same checks employed by legitimate banking apps in Vietnam and Thailand – the geographic focus of these ongoing attacks.The iOS version is believed only to be targeting users in Thailand, masquerading as the Thai government's official digital pensions app. That said, some think it has also made its way to Vietnam. This is because very similar attacks, which led to the theft of tens of thousands of dollars, were reported in the region earlier this month.""It is of note that GoldPickaxe.iOS is the first iOS Trojan observed by Group-IB that combines the following functionalities: collecting victims' biometric data, ID documents, intercepting SMS, and proxying traffic through the victims' devices,"" the researchers said.""Its Android sibling has even more functionalities than its iOS counterpart, due to more restrictions and the closed nature of iOS.""While Android malware is more common, given the platform allows users to sideload apps, the iOS discovery shocked researchers more given the tighter security controls on Apple's platform.The Android infection was more straightforward than that of the iOS version, with malicious apps simply being available to download/sideload via a fake but seemingly legitimate Google Play store.Researchers also found the Android version bore many more disguises than the iOS version – taking the form of more than 20 different government, finance, and utility organizations in Thailand, and allowing attackers to steal credentials for all of these services.How'd they get on Apple phones?In the case of iOS, the attackers had to be cunning. Their first method involved the abuse of Apple's TestFlight platform, which allows apps to be distributed as betas before full release to the App Store.After this method was stymied, attackers switched to more sophisticated social engineering. This involved influencing users to enroll their devices in an MDM program, allowing the attackers to push bad apps to devices that way.In all cases, the initial contact with victims was made by the attackers impersonating government authorities on the LINE messaging app, one of the region's most popular.For example, in some cases back in November, criminals impersonated officials from the Thai Ministry of Finance, and offered pension benefits to victims' elderly relatives.From there, victims were socially engineered into downloading GoldPickaxe through various means.Once the biometrics scans were captured, attackers then used these scans, along with deepfake software, to generate models of the victim's face.Attackers would download the target banking app onto their own devices and use the deepfake models, along with the stolen identity documents and intercepted SMS messages, to remotely break into victims' banks.The application of deepfake technology has largely been a hypothetical threat to infosec professionals for years, but GoldPickaxe serves as another reminder that the technology is now mature enough for use in real-world attacks and will probably be abused for years to come.Facial biometrics were only mandated in Thailand last year, with plans first announced in March with an enforcement date set for July. Vietnam is poised to mandate similar controls by April this year.- Miscreants turn to ad tech to measure malware metrics- European Court of Human Rights declares backdoored encryption is illegal- North Korea running malware-laden gambling websites as-a-service- OpenAI shuts down China, Russia, Iran, N Korea accounts caught doing naughty thingsFrom July 2023, all Thai banking apps had to comply with the new initiative and replace one-time passcodes with facial biometrics to decrease the threat of financial fraud in the region. This applied specifically to transactions exceeding 50,000 BAT (roughly $1,400).It means the GoldFactory group was able to develop a bespoke bypass for this new security initiative within just a few months, underlining the attacker's capabilities and skill set.""GoldFactory is a resourceful team, having many tricks up their sleeve: impersonation, accessibility keylogging, fake banking websites, fake bank alerts, fake call screens, identity, and facial recognition data collection,"" said the researchers.""Equipped with diverse tools, they have the flexibility to select and execute the most suitable one that fits the scenario. They are a strategic and well-orchestrated team.""They are aware of their target landscape and are constantly improving their toolset to tailor it to their target environment. Their developers demonstrate their relatively high proficiency in software development as well.""The Gold malware familyGoldPickaxe is the latest iteration of the numerous trojans developed by the GoldFactory crime group.The first – GoldDigger – was spotted in June 2023 and acted mainly as a traditional Android banking trojan granting control of a victim's device.GoldDigger and GoldPickaxe share code, but have different primary goals. The former focuses on gathering banking credentials while the latter pilfers personal information, including captures of victims' faces, identity documents, and so on.GoldDiggerPlus followed in September, adding additional, sophisticated functionality to the base GoldDigger trojan, including the GoldKefu APK, which is used in conjunction with GoldDiggerPlus.""In contrast with GoldDigger which relies mainly on Accessibility Service, GoldDiggerPlus and GoldKefu use webfakes to collect credentials or perform targeted scam calls instead. We conclude that the main purpose of GoldDiggerPlus is to authenticate itself to the C2 server, perform automated clicks when permissions are requested, record the screen, and stream the feed via Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP),"" the researchers said.""It also makes an improvement from GoldDigger in the area of granting permissions. It now takes a more modular and controlled approach, that permission is requested and granted when the C2 issues the command. It does not grant all the permissions all at once like GoldDigger.""GoldKefu offers an interesting capability in that it integrates the Agora SDK, enabling real-time video and voice calls. Attackers can then launch calls with victims while impersonating legitimate customer support reps from the brands they impersonate.Attackers can send fake alerts to app users warning them that 3 million BAT has been transferred out of their account and to contact their bank if the transaction wasn't authorized.Other warnings include fake error messages popping up when the trojan prevents banking apps from opening, prompting users to contact their bank to 'unfreeze their account.'These alerts have a one-touch 'contact' button which, if initiated within the working hours set by the cybercriminals, will initiate a call with the criminals who essentially operate a scam bank call center to harvest further information.The Android version of the most recent GoldPickaxe is thought to be an updated version of GoldDiggerPlus, which also includes the GoldKefu APK.The iOS version doesn't have these extensive capabilities due to the closed nature of Apple's iOS platform, the researchers said.""The adaptability of these cyber adversaries is remarkable, as evidenced by the evolution of their fraud schemes,"" said Group-IB. ""In addition to refining the capabilities of the original GoldDigger malware, they have introduced a new category of malware families that specialize in harvesting facial recognition data. They have also developed a tool that facilitates direct communication between victims and cybercriminals posing as legitimate bank call centers.""In conclusion, the relentless evolution of cybercriminal tactics, exemplified by the sophistication of the GoldFactory malware, underscores the critical need for a proactive and multi-faceted approach to cybersecurity, including user education and integrated modern security approaches to proactively detect the appearance of new trojans and notify end users."" ®",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Surge in 'Hunter-Killer' Malware Uncovered by Picus Security,"February 15, 2024PRESS RELEASESAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Picus Security, the Security Validation company, has released the Picus Red Report 2024. This fourth annual report shares learnings from an in-depth analysis of more than 600,000 real-world malware samples and identifies the most common techniques leveraged by attackers. This year, Picus uncovered a surge of ""Hunter-killer"" malware from the research findings, demonstrating a drastic shift in adversaries' ability to identify and neutralize advanced enterprise defenses such as next-gen firewalls, antivirus, and EDR. According to the report, there was a 333% increase in malware that can actively target defensive systems in an attempt to disable them.""We are witnessing a surge in ultra-evasive, highly aggressive malware which shares the characteristics of hunter-killer submarines,"" said Dr. Suleyman Ozarslan, Picus Security Co-founder and VP of Picus Labs. ""Just as these subs move silently through deep waters and launch devastating attacks to defeat their targets' defenses, new malware is designed to not only evade security tools but actively bring them down. We believe cybercriminals are changing tact in response to the security of average businesses being much-improved, and widely used tools offering far more advanced capabilities to detect threats. A year ago, it was relatively rare for adversaries to disable security controls. Now, this behavior is seen in a quarter of malware samples and is used by virtually every ransomware group and APT group.""The Red Report helps security teams better understand and battle cyber attacks by identifying the Top 10 most prevalent MITRE ATT&CK techniques exhibited by the latest malware. Its insights help prioritize defensive actions against commonly used techniques. Additional key findings include:Evolving tactics challenge detection and response: 70% of malware analyzed now employ stealth-oriented techniques by attackers, particularly those that facilitate evading security measures and maintaining persistence in networks.Invisibility at the forefront of evasion: There was a 150% increase in the use of T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information. This highlights a trend toward hindering the effectiveness of security solutions and obfuscating malicious activities to complicate the detection of attacks, forensic analysis, and incident response efforts.The ransomware saga continues: There was a 176% increase in the use of T1071 Application Layer Protocol, which are being strategically deployed for data exfiltration as part of sophisticated double extortion schemes.To combat Hunter-killer malware and stay ahead of 2024 malware trends, Picus is urging organizations to embrace machine learning, protect user credentials, and consistently validate their defenses against the latest tactics and techniques used by cybercriminals.""It can be incredibly difficult to detect if an attack has disabled or reconfigured security tools, because they may still appear to be working as expected,"" said Huseyin Can YUCEEL, Security Research Lead at Picus Security. ""Preventing attacks that would otherwise operate under the radar requires the use of multiple security controls with a defense-in-depth approach. Security validation must be a starting point for organizations to better understand their readiness and identify gaps. Unless an organization is proactively simulating attacks to assess the response of its EDR, XDR, SIEM, and other defensive systems that may be weakened or eliminated by Hunter-killer malware, they will not know they are down until it is too late.""For more information:MethodologyBetween January 2023 and December 2023, Picus Labs, the research unit of Picus Security, analyzed 667,401 unique files, with 612,080 (92%) categorized as malicious. Sources of these files include but are not limited to commercial and open-source threat intelligence services, security vendors and researchers, malware sandboxes, malware databases, and forums. From these files, a total of 7,754,801 actions were extracted, an average of 13 malicious actions per malware. These actions were then mapped to 7,015,759 MITRE ATT&CK techniques, an average of 11 techniques per malware.To compile the Picus Red Report 2024 Top Ten, Picus Labs researchers determined the number of malicious files that used each technique. They then calculated the percentage of malware in the dataset that utilized that technique. For example, the T1055 Process Injection technique was used in 195,044 (32%) of the 612,080 malicious files analyzed.About Picus SecurityPicus Security helps security teams consistently and accurately validate their security posture. Our Security Validation Platform simulates real-world threats to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls, identify high-risk attack paths to critical assets, and optimize threat prevention and detection capabilities.As the pioneer of Breach and Attack Simulation, we specialize in delivering the actionable insights our customers need to be threat-centric and proactive.Picus has been named a 'Cool Vendor' by Gartner and is recognized by Frost & Sullivan as a leader in the Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) market.You May Also Like",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

FBI disrupts Russian Moobot botnet infecting Ubiquiti routers,"The FBI took down a botnet of small office/home office (SOHO) routers used by Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) to proxy malicious traffic and to target the United States and its allies in spearphishing and credential theft attacks.This network of hundreds of Ubiquiti Edge OS routers infected with Moobot malware was controlled by GRU Military Unit 26165, also tracked as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Sednit.The Russian hackers' targets include U.S. and foreign governments, military entities, and security and corporate organizations.""This botnet was distinct from prior GRU and Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) malware networks disrupted by the Department in that the GRU did not create it from scratch. Instead, the GRU relied on the 'Moobot' malware, which is associated with a known criminal group,"" the Justice Department said.Cybercriminals not linked with the GRU (Russian Military Intelligence) first infiltrated Ubiquiti Edge OS routers and deployed the Moobot malware, targeting Internet-exposed devices with widely known default administrator passwords.Subsequently, the GRU hackers leveraged the Moobot malware to deploy their own custom malicious tools, effectively repurposing the botnet into a cyber espionage tool with global reach.On compromised routers, the FBI discovered a wide range of APT28 tools and artifacts, from Python scripts for harvesting webmail credentials and programs for stealing NTLMv2 digests to custom routing rules that redirected phishing traffic to dedicated attack infrastructure.FBI wipes malware and blocks remote accessAs part of court-authorized ""Operation Dying Ember,"" FBI agents remotely accessed the compromised routers and used the Moobot malware itself to delete stolen and malicious data and files.Next, they deleted the Moobot malware and blocked remote access that would've otherwise allowed the Russian cyberspies to reinfect the devices.""Additionally, in order to neutralize the GRU's access to the routers until victims can mitigate the compromise and reassert full control, the operation reversibly modified the routers' firewall rules to block remote management access to the devices, and during the course of the operation, enabled temporary collection of non-content routing information that would expose GRU attempts to thwart the operation,"" the Justice Department said.Besides thwarting GRU's access to the routers, the operation did not disrupt the devices' standard functionality or harvest user data. Moreover, the court-sanctioned actions that severed the routers' link to the Moobot botnet are only temporary.Users can reverse the FBI's firewall rules by factory resetting their routers or accessing them through the local networks. However, factory resetting the devices without changing the default admin password will expose them to reinfection.Chinese botnet disruptionMoobot is the second botnet used by state-sponsored hackers to evade detection disrupted by the FBI in 2024 after the takedown of the KV-botnet used by Chinese Volt Typhoon state hackers in January.Since then, CISA and the FBI also issued guidance for SOHO router manufacturers, urging them to secure their devices against ongoing attacks with the help of secure configuration defaults and eliminating web management interface flaws during development.The APT28 cyber-espionage group was previously linked to the 2015 hack of the German Federal Parliament (Deutscher Bundestag).They were also behind attacks against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 (for which they were charged in the U.S. two years later).The Council of the European Union also sanctioned multiple APT28 members in October 2020 for their involvement in the 2015 German Federal Parliament hack.Commentsfreon - 1 day agoIt sounds like these routers are shipped with a default admin password and with remote administration enabled.

Infection with malware and funding a despot? PricelessNorth Korea's latest money-making venture is the production and sale of gambling websites that come pre-infected with malware, according to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS).The Service on Wednesday identified South Korean cyber crime organizations as buyers of the sites.Reports allege that the North Korean faction responsible for this effort is an IT organization affiliated with the hermit kingdom's secretive Office 39 known as ""Gyeongheung.""Office 39 sits within the ruling Workers Party of Korea. It's believed by many – including the US Department of Treasury – to be a revenue-generating machine of the country, providing foreign currency and slush funds for the North Korea's leaders through both legal and illegal activities.Whoever runs the scam, the NIS believes they've made billions of dollars in profit.The websites are rented at around $5,000 a piece per month. For an extra $3,000 per month North Korea throws in tech support.Local media report that an additional $2000 to $5000 might be granted if the website can gather a significant volume of bank account details from the PayPal accounts of Chinese nationals.Furthermore, NIS reported that the websites it has investigated contained malicious code in a feature that made automatic bets.

They forged Chinese identification cards and stole relevant career credentials. To hide their tracks, the gang remitted money using bank accounts established using Chinese names and borrowed South Korean cyber gambling gang accounts.Some clients, however, evidently didn't mind that the operatives were under sanctions and knowingly maintained business with the North Koreans – lured by low cost and the ease of using a common language, according to a media report shared by NIS.Gyeonghueng is based in the Sino-Korean border town Dandong, which is also a hotspot for China's apparel industry since North Korean workers are willing to work for low wages.According to NIS, North Korean IT workers raising money illegally in the area blend right in. ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

Critical Software Vulnerabilities Impacting Credit Unions Discovered by LMG Security Researcher,"February 15, 2024PRESS RELEASEMISSOULA, Mont., Feb. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- LMG Security, an internationally recognized cybersecurity consulting firm, has discovered three new critical software vulnerabilities that pose a significant threat to hundreds of organizations in the United States. Emily Gosney, a cybersecurity consultant at LMG Security, discovered these vulnerabilities in a web application that is primarily used by credit unions to manage content. A malicious user could leverage these vulnerabilities to gain ""ultra admin"" access to any organization running this application. These vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to hundreds of organizations across the United States.""Impacted organizations using versions prior to v7.75 of this web application are urged to upgrade, and organizations using any version of this CMS should enable multi-factor authentication immediately,"" said Emily Gosney, cybersecurity consultant at LMG Security. The identified vulnerabilities have been assigned the following CVE IDs:CVE-2023-48985: A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the CMS admin portal login page 'login.php' could enable an unauthenticated malicious actor to intercept login credentials for the CMS admin portal. This vulnerability could be chained with CVE-2023-48987 to form a complete ""zero to ultra admin"" kill chain.CVE-2023-48986: A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in 'users.php' within the CMS admin portal could enable a lower privileged malicious actor to elevate privileges or trick a user of a higher privilege level to perform unintended actions within the admin portal.CVE-2023-48987: A blind SQL injection vulnerability in 'pages.php' within the CMS admin portal could enable an authenticated malicious actor to gain full read/write access to the backend database and leverage it to obtain the ""ultra admin"" password, which grants access to any organization running this CMS that does not have multi-factor authentication enabled.""The 'ultra admin' account is a vendor backdoor account that grants access to every installation of this application globally,"" Gosney continued. ""Just one organization running an outdated version of this application can put all other users at risk, including those who are already running the latest version.""To protect themselves from a data breach, Gosney advises, ""Impacted organizations should immediately upgrade to the latest software version and enable multi-factor authentication to prevent malicious actors who possess the 'ultra admin' password from logging into their application portal.""

TinyTurla was first documented by the cybersecurity company in September 2021.Turla, also known by the names Iron Hunter, Pensive Ursa, Secret Blizzard (formerly Krypton), Snake, Uroburos, and Venomous Bear, is a Russian state-affiliated threat actor linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB).In recent months, the threat actor has singled out the defense sector in Ukraine and Eastern Europe with a novel .NET-based backdoor called DeliveryCheck, while also upgrading its staple second-stage implant referred to as Kazuar, which it has put to use as early as 2017.The latest campaign involving TinyTurla-NG dates back to December 18, 2023, and is said to have been ongoing up until January 27, 2024. However, it's suspected that the activity may have actually commenced in November 2023 based on the malware compilation dates.It's currently not known how the backdoor is distributed to victim environments, but it has been found to employ compromised WordPress-based websites as command-and-control (C2) endpoints to fetch and execute instructions, enabling it to run commands via PowerShell or Command Prompt (cmd.exe) as well as download/upload files.TinyTurla-NG also acts as a conduit to deliver PowerShell scripts dubbed TurlaPower-NG that are designed to exfiltrate key material used to secure the password databases of popular password management software in the form of a ZIP archive.""This campaign appears to be highly targeted and focused on a small number of organizations, of which until now we can only confirm Poland based ones,"" a Cisco Talos researcher told The Hacker News, noting that the assessment is based on the current visibility.""This campaign is highly compartmentalized, a few compromised websites acting as C2s contact a few samples, meaning that it's not easy to pivot from one sample/C2 to others using the same infrastructure that would give us confidence they are related.""The disclosure comes as Microsoft and OpenAI revealed that nation-state actors from Russia are exploring generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, to understand satellite communication protocols, radar imaging technologies, and seek support with scripting tasks.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Islamic Nonprofit Infiltrated for 3 Years With Silent Backdoor,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Saudi Arabia charity was under surveillance with the modified reverse proxy tool, researchers discovered.February 13, 2024Security researchers recently uncovered a stealthy espionage campaign targeting an Islamic charitable nonprofit organization in Saudi Arabia.The long-term campaign — apparently active since March 2021 — relies on a previously unreported custom backdoor, dubbed Zardoor, researchers at Cisco Talos reported. The malware exfiltrates data from the victim organization — which Cisco did not identify — approximately twice a month.The deployment of modified reverse-proxy tools and the ability to evade detection for more than two years means that the assault is likely the work of an ""advanced"" attacker, the researchers say.Security researchers have yet to identify any other victims of the Zardoor malware besides the Saudi Arabia-based charity.APTs Love Reverse ProxiesZardoor's use of reverse proxy tools matches the tactics of several Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, according to Cisco Talos, but the ""choice of the compromised target does not align with the known objectives"" of Chinese espionage groups.APT groups using reverse proxy tools is ""relatively common,"" overall, says Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at ReliaQuest Threat Research.Russia's APT29, the Chinese-backed Volt Typhoon group, North Korea's Lazarus group, and various Iranian state-sponsored groups, including Phosphorus, are among the roster of nation-state groups that employ reverse proxy tools.Reverse proxies are normally used as load balancers in complex system and application architectures. However, malicious actors abuse the technology to set up communications with otherwise unreachable systems such as RDP servers, domain controllers, files, or database servers on compromised networks.""Reverse proxies function by allowing covert communications channels to be established between internal systems on a compromised network and external servers controlled by an adversarial group,"" says Christoph Cemper, founder and CEO of AIPRM.""At a technical level, this is accomplished by the adversary deploying both a reverse proxy client component within the target environment and a corresponding server interface that they control remotely,"" he adds. ""Network traffic is then redirected through this multipart bidirectional tunnel in a manner that obscures the ultimate source and destination.""Cemper explains that adversaries frequently take steps to disguise these proxy-facilitated connections as normal Web or Internet activity, such as routing communications over ports associated with common protocols like HTTPS and embedding the redirects within legitimate domain names or IP addresses.""The incorporation of widely supported standards like TLS encryption also shields the content and parameters of transmitted data from routine inspection or detection,"" he says.Thwarting the ThreatAccording to Cisco Talos' technical blog post, the Zardoor campaign began with an as-yet-unknown attack vector.The attackers subsequently set up a command and control mechanism for the attack using open source reverse proxy tools such as Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP), a customized version of the Socks Linux server and Venom, a penetration-testing tool for running security audits.Once a foothold into the victim's network was established, the attackers used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for lateral movement and planting the Zardoor malware.Zardoor establishes a persistent backdoor that communicates with the attackers' command-and-control (C2) setup, allowing them to issue commands, such as to deploy updated malware packages or exfiltrate data. The malware is programmed to grab encrypted data and upload it to the attackers' C2 infrastructure.""Zar32.dll"" is a malicious library and one of the main components of Zardoor. It is an HTTP/SSL remote access tool (RAT) designed to piggyback on legitimate network applications, and operates through a Socks or HTTPS proxy. The malware abuses IP addresses used by CloudFlare DNS services.Cisco has added detection for the Zardoor malware to its enterprise security tools and published indications of compromise, moves that will likely spur the rest of the vendor community to add similar detection and response capabilities.""Even enterprises using security products other than Cisco's have options to improve their resilience,"" says AIPRM's Cemper. ""Specifically, security teams should follow standard protocols for addressing new malware threats identified in the wild: Review the indicators of compromise published by threat researchers and check systems and network activity logs for any traces suggesting infection.""In addition, he advises, ensure that anti-malware and intrusion detection products are armed with updated signatures for the malware.Cisco Talos recommends employing a defense-in-depth security posture to defend against similar threats. ""Unfortunately, as we know it all too well, there is no 100% effective protection against persistent and advanced adversaries, and users need to be able to detect the attack if it successfully evades the protection layers,"" a Cisco spokesperson said.Read more about:DR Global Middle East & AfricaAbout the Author(s)You May Also Like",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Miscreants turn to ad tech to measure malware metrics,"Now that's what you call dual-use techCyber baddies have turned to ad networks to measure malware deployment and to avoid detection, according to HP Wolf Security.The security group's Q4 2023 Threat Insights Report finds criminals have adopted ad tech tools to make their social engineering attacks more effective.""Cyber criminals are applying the same tools a business might use to manage a marketing campaign to optimize their malware campaigns, increasing the likelihood the user will take the bait,"" explained Ian Pratt, global head of security for personal systems at HP, in a statement.The DarkGate PDF malware campaign, for example, relies on ad tools. Dating back to 2018, DarkGate provides backdoor access to victim's computers for the purpose of data theft and ransomware.The campaign involves sending email messages to victims with malicious PDF attachments. Those duped into opening one see a social engineering message – often in the form of a Microsoft OneDrive error message that prompts the victim to click a link to download the document.- Prudential Financial finds cybercrims lurking inside its IT systems- Bumblebee malware wakes from hibernation, forgets what year it is, attacks with macros- Crooks hook hundreds of exec accounts after phishing in Azure C-suite pond- Korean eggheads crack Rhysida ransomware and release free decryptor toolThe report explains that this often works because the attackers know that office workers rely on cloud-based applications with user interfaces that often change. This makes it more difficult to spot fake interface elements or bogus error messages.Clicking on the fake OneDrive error message does not immediately download the malware payload. Rather, it routes the victim's click – containing identifiers and the domain hosting the file – through an advertising network and then it fetches the malicious URL, which is not evident in the PDF.""Using an ad network as a proxy helps the attacker to evade detection and collect analytics on who clicks their links,"" the report explains. ""Since the advertising network uses CAPTCHAs to verify real users to prevent click fraud, it's unlikely automated malware analysis systems would be able to scan the malware payload, leading to the risk of falsely classifying the file as safe.""According to HP Wolf Security, 11 percent of malware analyzed in Q4 2023 relied on PDFs for delivery – up from 4 percent in Q1 and Q2 that same year. As an example, the security biz points to the WikiLoader campaign, which used a fake parcel delivery PDF to spread malware known as Ursnif.The security biz also notes that it's seeing more Office exploits and fewer macro-enabled attacks. During Q4, about 84 percent of attempted intrusions incorporated spreadsheets, while 73 percent involved Word documentsFinally, the report notes that attackers continue to host malware on cloud services as a way to benefit from the trust users may place in these platforms. The analysts point to the Remcos remote access trojan, which relies on a user downloaded JavaScript file hosted on chat service Discord. The malicious file then connects to file sharing service TextBin to fetch a Base64 encoded executable hosted there.While the attacks may be more sophisticated, Pratt's advice for countering them remains the same: ""To protect against well-resourced threat actors, organizations must follow zero trust principles, isolating and containing risky activities like opening email attachments, clicking on links, and browser downloads."" ®",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Middle East & Africa CISOs Plan to Increase 2024 Budgets by 10%,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.New data shows higher-than-expected cybersecurity growth in the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa region, thanks to AI and other factors.February 13, 2024Geopolitical threats, security uncertainty surrounding generative AI, and increasing data-protection regulations across the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa will propel cybersecurity spending to more than $6.5 billion in 2024 — surpassing previous investment estimates.The market forecast, part of IDC's overall information and communications technology (ICT) insights for the region, suggests that the cybersecurity market will continue to grow quickly in the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa (META) region. In fact, more than three-quarters of CISOs in the region are planning to increase budgets by at least 10% this year, IDC found.This strong growth in part is driven by companies facing more cybercrime and regulatory enforcement, requiring them to increase spending on cybersecurity products and services, says Yotasha Thaver, a research analyst for IT security data at IDC South Africa and META.""The increase in successful cybercrimes has driven demand for consulting services in non-core countries where awareness is not as high compared to the core countries,"" she says. ""There is also a push coming from governments — particularly in the Middle East — for improved cybersecurity.""IDC divides the region's countries into ""core,"" which spend significantly on technology and cybersecurity, and ""non-core"" countries, which are on a slower growth curve. Both the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for example, are core countries and are ranked in the top-10 countries worldwide on the Global Cybersecurity Index, a five-year census of nations' efforts to secure their networks and technologies.IDC uses local market data, surveys, and more than 130 analysts across the region to calculate its estimates of market size and growth.Governments, Private Sector Investing in CybersecurityWhile the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa account for a small fraction of the worldwide cybersecurity market — which IDC forecasted would reach $219 billion in 2023 — these regions are investing at about the same rate in their market as companies in North America and Europe.Yet the improvements are uneven, Thaver says. ""Countries with improved security posture have higher demand for security services, such as managed security services and integration services, compared with other countries,"" she says. ""With the exception of core countries, I would say that GCC countries"" — that is, countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council, or Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE — ""are improving cybersecurity posture at a faster rate than African countries.""Yet companies in the Middle East still have a ways to go. More than half of Middle East firms (51%) cite a lack of funding as their main challenge in managing cybersecurity, compared with 36% globally, according to consulting firm Deloitte's ""Middle East Future of Cyber"" report.The entire region must contend with the rapidly changing environment as well, from the impetus to incorporate AI into their business operations to increasing attacks connected with geopolitical events, says Shilpi Handa, associate research director, META, for IDC.""The uncertainty around generative-AI-related threats, increases in budgets, and a huge regulatory ramp-up — like in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and United Arab Emirates — especially around data privacy and AI guidelines"" are driving the increase, she says. ""And most importantly, geopolitical stress is leading to an increase in cyber budgets, especially in organizations with critical infrastructure.""Targeted Attacks CommonThe forecasted growth in the cybersecurity market comes as local CISOs worry that their cloud security may be lacking, with around 70% of firms concerned over cloud security. Targeted attacks by state actors are common in the Middle East, with about 40% of cyber attacks carried out by APT groups, according to a report on the regional threats by cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies published last year. More than half of all threats targeted government agencies, industrial systems, or mass media, with remote access Trojans (RATs) and spyware the most common types of malware.While ransomware is less common, the rise of wipers — resembling ransomware's destructive capabilities — is a trend in the Middle East, the report stated.""A regional feature of the Middle East is the use of wipers by malicious actors in attacks using malware,"" the report stated. ""When this malware infects a device, it erases all user and system files, causing the device to crash. A particularly dangerous scenario is when wipers infect ICS equipment, since its failure can lead to disruptions in the technological process and even to emergency situations.""Overall, organizations in both the Middle East and Africa regions tend to efficiently allocate their cybersecurity budgets, and they lead their peers in cybersecurity. However, with the exception of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, most countries lag behind their global peers in cybersecurity maturity.Read more about:DR Global Middle East & AfricaAbout the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE
Cybersecurity's Transformative Shift,"February 15, 2024COMMENTARYCybersecurity, once a fortress built on rigid protocols and reactive measures, is undergoing a transformative shift. As digital landscapes become more intricate and data-driven, the need for a nuanced approach to safeguarding digital assets is more pronounced than ever. This evolution marks a departure from conventional threat detection, steering toward a strategy that emphasizes context and preempts user behavior to detect anomalous patterns.This isn't just about erecting barriers against known threats; it's about delving deeper into the subtleties of how data is accessed, shared, and utilized. It's a proactive stance, focusing on the early detection of potential risks through the lens of user interactions and data movements, instead of simply ""guarding the fort."" For many analysts, this heralds a significant change in how organizations perceive and tackle cybersecurity, shifting the focus from basic threat hunting and detection to a more holistic understanding of the digital ecosystem.Threat Hunting Alone Is No Longer EnoughThe conventional model of cybersecurity has long been centered on reactive threat detection. This approach, grounded in the detection of known threats, remains important and was incredibly effective in a digital landscape where threats were more predictable and less complex. It relied on established security protocols and predefined threat databases, focusing on identifying and mitigating threats after they had breached the system. This method served as the foundation of many cybersecurity frameworks, operating under the assumption that known threats could be managed effectively with existing tools and knowledge.However, the digital world's rapid expansion into the cloud, combined with a rush of new AI-based capabilities, has brought about a new era of cyber threats, characterized by their complexity and subtlety. The limitations of the traditional model have become increasingly apparent, as cyberattackers continuously develop novel methods to circumvent standard security measures. These emerging threats often exploit vulnerabilities in unexpected ways, making the reactive nature of threat detection on its own obsolete. This realization has sparked a crucial shift in cybersecurity, giving rise to strategies that are not just reactive but also proactive, leveraging user behavior and data flow to assess risk and preempt potential threats.The Rise of User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) isn't exactly new, but it's now becoming standard. UEBA is unique in that it shifts the focus from simply responding to known threats to analyzing patterns of user and entity behavior to identify anomalies that could indicate potential security risks. This method leverages advanced analytics, machine learning, and ""big data"" to build a comprehensive baseline of normal user behavior, making it easier to spot deviations that could signal a breach or malicious activity. By focusing on behavior patterns, UEBA provides an adaptive, context-sensitive approach to security, capable of identifying threats that traditional tools might miss.This approach is particularly effective in detecting insider threats, compromised accounts, and even subtle forms of data exfiltration. For instance, UEBA can flag activities like unusual login times, repeated failed access attempts, or unexpected spikes in data downloads. These activities, while not inherently malicious, can serve as early warning signs of potential security issues. It's not about spotting ""bad behavior"" per se, but about identifying ""not good"" behavior and flagging it as a potential concern. By integrating UEBA into their cybersecurity strategies, organizations can gain a more nuanced and proactive stance in their defense mechanisms, enabling them to respond to threats before they escalate into serious breaches.The Growing Importance of Data FlowData flow involves deep-diving into the intricacies of how data is handled, accessed, and transferred within an organization. This concept extends beyond the traditional perimeter defense, delving into the granular aspects of data movement and access patterns. By understanding the mechanics of data — how it flows, who accesses it, and when — cybersecurity strategies can be fine-tuned to detect subtle irregularities that might indicate a security risk. It's like understanding the inner workings of a complex machine; by learning each part's role and normal operation, it becomes easier to identify when something doesn't work as intended. This level of insight is crucial in a landscape where threats are not always overt or immediately recognizable. By incorporating data flow into their cybersecurity framework, including good API security practices, organizations can adopt a more proactive stance, identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited.In tandem with the shift toward more nuanced cybersecurity strategies, there's also a growing emphasis on data privacy and the adoption of sovereign clouds and data localization. This trend reflects an increasing awareness of the need for stringent data protection, especially in a global context, where data regulations vary significantly across regions. Sovereign clouds offer a solution by aligning data storage and processing with local regulations, ensuring compliance and enhancing data sovereignty. This proactive approach to privacy is not just about adhering to laws like the GDPR; it's about recognizing the importance of regional nuances in data regulation and providing a tailored response. By integrating these considerations into their cybersecurity framework, organizations ensure that their data management practices are not only secure but also compliant with the diverse legal requirements they face, fortifying their stance on both cybersecurity and data privacy.Integrating UEBA Into Modern Cybersecurity StrategiesModern cybersecurity solutions that support UEBA often include features that facilitate secure remote access to data, controlled sharing, and collaboration, all while maintaining a vigilant watch over data security. These features ensure that while employees and partners can access and work with data seamlessly, any unusual activity is promptly identified and addressed. This balance of security and usability is crucial in today's fast-paced, data-driven business environments, where the agility of operations must be matched with uncompromising security measures. By weaving UEBA and data flow into their security initiatives, organizations can achieve this balance, creating a robust security framework that supports, rather than hinders, their operational goals.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,regulatory changes and compliance,FALSE
U.S. State Government Network Breached via Former Employee's Account,"The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has revealed that an unnamed state government organization's network environment was compromised via an administrator account belonging to a former employee.""This allowed the threat actor to successfully authenticate to an internal virtual private network (VPN) access point,"" the agency said in a joint advisory published Thursday alongside the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC).""The threat actor connected to the [virtual machine] through the victim's VPN with the intent to blend in with legitimate traffic to evade detection.""It's suspected that the threat actor obtained the credentials following a separate data breach owing to the fact that the credentials appeared in publicly available channels containing leaked account information.The admin account, which had access to a virtualized SharePoint server, also enabled the attackers to access another set of credentials stored in the server, which had administrative privileges to both the on-premises network and the Azure Active Directory (now called Microsoft Entra ID).This further made it possible to explore the victim's on-premises environment, and execute various lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) queries against a domain controller. The attackers behind the malicious activity are presently unknown.A deeper investigation into the incident has revealed no evidence that the adversary moved laterally from the on-premises environment to the Azure cloud infrastructure.The attackers ultimately accessed host and user information and posted the information on the dark web for likely financial gain, the bulletin noted, prompting the organization to reset passwords for all users, disable the administrator account as well as remove the elevated privileges for the second account.It's worth pointing out that neither of the two accounts had multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled, underscoring the need for securing privileged accounts that grant access to critical systems. It's also recommended to implement the principle of least privilege and create separate administrator accounts to segment access to on-premises and cloud environments.The development is a sign that threat actors leverage valid accounts, including those belonging to former employees that have not been properly removed from the Active Directory (AD), to gain unauthorized access to organizations.""Unnecessary accounts, software, and services in the network create additional vectors for a threat actor to compromise,"" the agencies said.""By default, in Azure AD all users can register and manage all aspects of applications they create. These default settings can enable a threat actor to access sensitive information and move laterally in the network. In addition, users who create an Azure AD automatically become the Global Administrator for that tenant. This could allow a threat actor to escalate privileges to execute malicious actions.""",data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,TRUE
Microsoft Exchange Server Flaw Exploited as a Zero-Day Bug,"February 15, 2024Microsoft has identified one of the critical vulnerabilities in Exchange Server that the company disclosed in February's Patch Tuesday update as actually being a zero-day threat that attackers are already actively exploiting.CVE-2024-21410 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability that gives a remote, unauthenticated attacker a way to disclose and then relay Windows NT Lan Manager (NTLM) hashes to impersonate legitimate users on Exchange Server.Bug Enabled Pass-the-Hash AttacksMicrosoft had assessed the bug as being of critical severity (9.1 on the 10-point CVSS scale) but initially did not flag it as a zero-day when releasing a fix for it Tuesday. The company revised its advisory for the flaw on Wednesday with a note about observing exploit activity in the wild but providing no other details.The company's revision makes CVE-2024-2140 one of three zero-day bugs that Microsoft disclosed this month. The other two are CVE-2024-21412, a security feature bypass flaw that a threat actor called Water Hydra (aka Dark Casino) is using in attacks against financial traders; and CVE-2024-21351, a SmartScreen bypass vulnerability.According to Microsoft, CVE-2024-21410 allows an attacker to target an NTLM client such as Outlook in an NTLM credential-leaking attack. ""The leaked credentials can then be relayed against the Exchange server to gain privileges as the victim client and to perform operations on the Exchange server on the victim's behalf,"" Microsoft said.The problem in the case of CVE-2024-21410 has to do with versions of Exchange Server 2019 prior to the Feb. 13 update not enabling NTLM relay protections — or Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) — by default. Without that protection, an attacker can relay leaked NTLM credentials from targets such as Outlook to Exchange Server, Microsoft said.Cumulative UpdateThe Feb. 13 update — 2024 H1 Cumulative Update (CU) for Exchange Server 2019 (or CU14) — enables that protection by default, meaning users who implement it are protected against the threat from CVE-2024-21410. Microsoft has published an Exchange Blog Post for more information on the update and its protections against various threats.Mayuresh Dani, manager of security research at Qualys threat research labs, says attackers are likely to have little trouble finding vulnerable Exchange Servers to target. ""By my last count, there were more than 200,000 Microsoft Exchange devices currently exposed to the public,"" Dani says. ""Sifting through these using automation would take a few hours to come up with a list of affected systems.""Mike Walters, president and CEO of Action1, says organizations using versions of Exchange Server 2019 prior to CU14 will need to ensure they have activated EPA alongside installing the latest cumulative update. He says, ""Administrators can also use the ExchangeExtendedProtectionManagement PowerShell script to enable EP in earlier versions of Exchange Server, such as Server 2016, which will also protect systems from attacks that target devices that are missing the CVE-2024-21410 patches.""Pay Attention to the DetailsBefore enabling EP on Exchange Servers, however, administrators should assess their environment and review the issues that Microsoft has identified in its EP documentation to avoid disrupting existing functionality, Walters advises.""Administrators should be aware that EP only uses NTLMv2 and TLS 1.2 and later,"" he says. Another consideration is the fact that Extended Protection isn't supported in environments that use SSL offloading. Similarly, under certain circumstances organizations cannot enable Extended Protection on Exchange Server 2013 servers, Exchange Server 2016 CU22, Exchange Server 2019 CU11 or older, and on Exchange servers that are published with the Hybrid Agent.""Additional issues are described on the Microsoft support website and you must be prepared for them,"" Walters says. ""This update needs to be fully tested before implementation."" Organizations shouldn't even try to apply the update without proper testing, he adds.Attackers often use a so-called pass-the-hash method for lateral movement purposes. The tactic involves stealing a user's NTLM hash from one computer and using it to access another computer, in this case an Exchange Server. One of its main appeals is that the tactic allows users to authenticate as a legitimate user on a target system without knowing the user's password.In 2023, Russia's Fancy Bear advanced persistent threat group (aka Forest Blizzard and APT28) took advantage of a similar flaw (tracked as CVE-2023-23397) in a spate of information-stealing attacks that targeted governments in the Middle East and several NATO nations. Microsoft has a resource dedicated to pass-the-hash attacks for organizations that want to learn more about the attack vector.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",vulnerability reports,vulnerability reports,TRUE
European human rights court says no to weakened encryption,"European Court of Human Rights declares backdoored encryption is illegalSurprising third-act twist as Russian case means more freedom for allThe European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that laws requiring crippled encryption and extensive data retention violate the European Convention on Human Rights – a decision that may derail European data surveillance legislation known as Chat Control.The court issued a decision on Tuesday stating that ""the contested legislation providing for the retention of all internet communications of all users, the security services’ direct access to the data stored without adequate safeguards against abuse and the requirement to decrypt encrypted communications, as applied to end-to-end encrypted communications, cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society.""The ""contested legislation"" mentioned above refers to a legal challenge that started in 2017 after a demand from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) that messaging service Telegram provide technical information to assist the decryption of a user's communication. The plaintiff, Anton Valeryevich Podchasov, challenged the order in Russia but his claim was dismissed.In 2019, Podchasov brought the matter to the ECHR. Russia joined the Council of Europe – an international human rights organization – in 1996 and was a member until it withdrew in March 2022 following its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Because the 2019 case predates Russia's withdrawal, the ECHR continued to consider the matter.The court concluded that the Russian law requiring Telegram ""to decrypt end-to-end encrypted communications risks amounting to a requirement that providers of such services weaken the encryption mechanism for all users."" As such, the court considers that requirement disproportionate to legitimate law enforcement goals.- Privacy crusaders accuse X of ad-targeting that flouts EU rules- German Digital Affairs Committee hearing heaps scorn on Chat Control- Open Source Policy Summit: Where FOSS and government meet- Scanning phones to detect child abuse evidence is harmful, 'magical' thinkingWhile the ECHR decision is unlikely to have any effect within Russia, it matters to countries in Europe that are contemplating similar decryption laws – such as Chat Control and the UK government's Online Safety Act.Chat Control is shorthand for European data surveillance legislation that would require internet service providers to scan digital communications for illegal content – specifically child sexual abuse material and potentially terrorism-related information. Doing so would necessarily entail weakening the encryption that keeps communication private.Patrick Breyer, a member of the European parliament for the Pirate Party, hailed the ruling for demonstrating that Chat Control is incompatible with EU law.""With this outstanding landmark judgment, the 'client-side scanning' surveillance on all smartphones proposed by the EU Commission in its chat control bill is clearly illegal,"" said Breyer.""It would destroy the protection of everyone instead of investigating suspects. EU governments will now have no choice but to remove the destruction of secure encryption from their position on this proposal – as well as the indiscriminate surveillance of private communications of the entire population!"" ®",regulatory changes and compliance,regulatory changes and compliance,TRUE
Ivanti Vulnerability Exploited to Install 'DSLog' Backdoor on 670+ IT Infrastructures,"Threat actors are leveraging a recently disclosed security flaw impacting Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA gateways to deploy a backdoor codenamed DSLog on susceptible devices.That's according to findings from Orange Cyberdefense, which said it observed the exploitation of CVE-2024-21893 within hours of the public release of the proof-the-concept (PoC) code.CVE-2024-21893, which was disclosed by Ivanti late last month alongside CVE-2024-21888, refers to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the SAML module that, if successfully exploited, could permit access to otherwise restricted resources sans any authentication.The Utah-based company has since acknowledged that the flaw has limited targeted attacks, although the exact scale of the compromises is unclear.Then, last week, the Shadowserver Foundation revealed a surge in exploitation attempts targeting the vulnerability originating from over 170 unique IP addresses, shortly after both Rapid7 and AssetNote shared additional technical specifics.Orange Cyberdefense's latest analysis shows that compromises have been detected as early as February 3, with the attack targeting an unnamed customer to inject a backdoor that grants persistent remote access.""The backdoor is inserted into an existing Perl file called 'DSLog.pm,'"" the company said, highlighting an ongoing pattern in which existing legitimate components – in this case, a logging module – are modified to add the malicious code.DSLog, the implant, comes fitted with its own tricks to hamper analysis and detection, including embedding a unique hash per appliance, thereby making it impossible to use the hash to contact the same backdoor on another device.The same hash value is supplied by the attackers to the User-Agent header field in an HTTP request to the appliance to allow the malware to extract the command to be executed from a query parameter called ""cdi."" The decoded instruction is then run as the root user.""The web shell does not return status/code when trying to contact it,"" Orange Cyberdefense said. ""There is no known way to detect it directly.""It further observed evidence of threat actors erasing "".access"" logs on ""multiple"" appliances in a bid to cover up the forensic trail and fly under the radar.But by checking the artifacts that were created when triggering the SSRF vulnerability, the company said it was able to detect 670 compromised assets during an initial scan on February 3, a number that has dropped to 524 as of February 7.In light of the continued exploitation of Ivanti devices, it's highly recommended that ""all customers factory reset their appliance before applying the patch to prevent the threat actor from gaining upgrade persistence in your environment.""",vulnerability reports,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

Launch of those satellites began in April of last year after a number of delays in the program.Tests of the PWSA tranche 0 satellites, which was supposed to take place over the summer last year, only happened in late November due to concerns from the US Federal Aviation Administration that downlinks from the constellation to Earth could cause dangerous interference for aircraft and ground-based receivers.The National Telecommunications and Information Agency issued a waiver for the tests, but only over international waters and on the ground in an unnamed Five Eyes country.The PWSA constellation will eventually feature as many as four tranches and hundreds of satellites, which will add progressively more capabilities to build a space-based communications network for US military. Along with missile tracking, PWSA satellites will provide targeting of objects beyond line-of-site, low-latency data links, improved positioning and navigation services, and encrypted communications.Satellites for Tranche 1 of the PWSA are being constructed now, we're told, and are scheduled for launch later this year.The pair of HBTSS satellites, on the other hand, are a ""space sensor prototype demonstration providing fire control quality data required to defeat advanced missile threats,"" the Pentagon said yesterday. The missile sensors in HBTSS satellites are also different from those onboard PWSA sats, which SDA director Derek Tournear said will give the Defense Department improved threat visibility.""In Tranche 1 [of PWSA], SDA will fly both sensor types as an operational system – medium-field-of-view demonstrating fire control, based on HBTSS design, and wide-field-of-view doing warning and tracking, based on T0 tracking design,"" Tournear said.""Following the successful demonstration of HBTSS capabilities, the responsibility for HBTSS operational fielding will be transferred to [the US Space Force] and MDA will continue the development of the next generation of space-based fire-control sensors for missile defense,"" an MDA spokesperson told us.But can they stop space nukes?US House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Turner (R-OH) made a cryptic statement yesterday alluding to a ""serious national security threat."" Reports have claimed Turner was referring to Russian plans to develop and deploy some kind of space-based nuclear weapon, though it's not entirely clear that's actually the case.Reports have indicated the Russian weapon would be designed to take out other satellites, and while Turner has urged President Biden to declassify all information regarding the threat to enable open discussion of a solution, other parties are urging calm and saying the potential weapon isn't necessarily a threat.- Report reveals US Space Force unprepared to counter orbital threats- US amends hypersonic weapons strategy: If you can't zoom with 'em, boom 'em- Russia says Starlink satellites could become military targets- US Space Force finally creates targeting unit – better late than never, right?While describing it as significant, House representative Jim Himes (D-CT) said there ""is no cause for alarm or panic,"" and it's ""like intelligence we see a couple times a month.""If accurate, however, it would put Russia at odds with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which states that signatories ""shall not place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit."" The pact was signed by the Soviet Union, and is recognized by Russia. The Kremlin has already tested ground-launched missiles to destroy its own satellites, though not nuclear ones – and not ones that would be launched from space.Russian officials denied the anti-sat space nuke claims, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a ploy by the White House to get Congress to approve funding for Ukraine's fight against Russia's 2022 invasion of the country.""It is obvious that the White House is trying, by hook or by crook, to push Congress to vote on the bill to allocate money,"" Peskov told Russian news agency TASS. ""We'll see what tricks the White House will resort to.""The US Senate has approved a $95 billion bill to provide defense assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, but House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said yesterday he has no plans to bring the bill to an immediate vote in the House. ®Updated to addThe White House on Thursday confirmed it has intelligence indicating Russia is working on “an anti-satellite capability,"" while downplaying the risk to us here on terra firma, echoing what House Rep Himes said above.“This is not an active capability that’s been deployed,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. “And though Russia’s pursuit of this particular capability is troubling there was no immediate threat to anyone’s safety. We are not talking about a weapon that can be used to attack human beings or cause physical destruction here on Earth.""",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Cyberattack Disrupts German Battery-Production Lines,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.It's unclear what kind of cyberattack VARTA AG is facing, but it has shut down its systems until it can become operational again.February 15, 2024VARTA AG, a German battery manufacturer, has announced that it suffered a cyberattack on its IT systems the night of Feb. 12.The attack has affected five production plants and their administration, according to the company's press announcement. Because of this, the company's IT systems and its assembly lines have been temporarily shut down and disconnected from the Internet.The scope and impact of the attack is still being determined, so it's unclear what kind of attack the battery company is dealing with, be it ransomware or otherwise.VARTA AG also noted that it took precautionary measures against further attacks, and that a task force was set up to help resume operations when possible alongside cybersecurity experts.VARTA AG has not provided any additional information as to when production will resume or when its IT system will once again be connected to the Internet.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",data breaches and security incidents,news and industry updates,FALSE
CISA HBOM Framework Doesn't Go Far Enough,"News, news analysis, and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology.CISA's recently introduced framework for hardware bill of materials is an important step in addressing semiconductor risks. But further tracking beyond manufacturing is critical to its usefulness.February 15, 2024The recently published hardware bill of materials (HBOM) framework from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a much-needed step toward ensuring semiconductor chip security — but it doesn't go far enough.The framework offers a consistent and repeatable way for vendors and purchasers to communicate about hardware components, which is critical for supply chain management and risk assessment. However, an HBOM must go beyond the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. It must track chips once they leave the factory, throughout their entire life cycle in the end products, in order to provide the robust security we need against emerging cyber threats.We were reminded why this level of vigilance is important in August, when Google researcher Daniel Moghimi uncovered the Downfall vulnerability. Downfall, which affects a broad family of advanced microprocessors, can be exploited to allow attackers access to private data. But the initial chips impacted by the vulnerability were manufactured in 2015. It has been eight years since the first devices to include those semiconductors entered the market.Even if CISA's HBOM framework had been in place back then, it would still be ineffective against Downfall because it doesn't track where and how those semiconductors are in use. That's why we need a more thorough HBOM framework, one with additional life cycle traceability, to shore up a chip's security posture once a new vulnerability is uncovered.Existing Framework a Good StartDespite its early shortcomings, CISA must be commended for introducing an HBOM framework, even if it calls it ""voluntary and flexible."" It's a meaningful action by the government to address security risks within the semiconductor supply chain.The framework encourages businesses to detail their upstream sourcing, including a list of all suppliers and components. It also calls for traceability throughout the manufacturing process, and it outlines a consistent way to name all component attributes.These are all worthwhile conditions because while a company may know what a chip is supposed to do, it often doesn't know how it has been designed. By spelling it out, CISA acknowledges the pivotal role that safeguarding the supply chain plays in ensuring chip security. This increased visibility is intended to marginalize high-risk vendors and minimize counterfeit or malicious parts from being introduced during production.This framework follows another recent government effort to increase supply chain transparency — US President Joe Biden's May 2021 executive order that mandates software bills of materials (SBOMs) for federal vendors. An SBOM inventories all software components, versions, and vulnerabilities so organizations can quickly respond to security concerns as they arise. Pairing one with an HBOM would provide comprehensive, integrated, and complementary security tracking of the entire life cycle of electronic products from development to disposal.But unlike the SBOM directive, the scope of CISA's HBOM framework conclusively ends when manufacturing is complete. There must be a record of where that chip ends up. By forgoing that same level of visibility after chips leave the factory, multiple security risks persist. We need an HBOM with an end-to-end view to help us act once we identify the Downfalls of the future.Chips Remain Vulnerable for YearsAs Downfall demonstrated, vulnerabilities may not surface until years after devices have gone to market because hardware components can have prolonged life spans and lack modern security protections. Whereas software can be patched, hardware vulnerabilities — unless they can be remediated by a firmware update — must be addressed through physical manipulation or other fixes that may reduce a device's performance or disable functionality altogether.This is what makes a more comprehensive HBOM important. Organizations must be able to grasp which threats they face due to chip vulnerabilities, with complete visibility into the manufacturing and entire life cycle of the chip. Only the utmost transparency can provide the necessary intelligence for proactive monitoring and rapid response once flaws inevitably surface. Anything less is an unacceptable risk.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeWhat Using Security to Regulate AI Chips Could Look LikeFeb 16, 2024|3 Min ReadCISA HBOM Framework Doesn't Go Far EnoughFeb 15, 2024|3 Min ReadManaged Everything?

AWS SNS Hijackings Fuel Cloud Smishing Campaign,"February 15, 2024Showcasing a previously unseen cyberattack technique, threat actors are using Amazon Web Services Simple Notification Service (AWS SNS) and a custom bulk-messaging spam script called SNS Sender to fuel an ongoing ""smishing"" campaign that impersonates the US Postal Service.While the abuse of AWS SNS, a cloud-based messaging platform, is novel, the campaign is an example of what is becoming an increasingly common theme: Businesses and threat actors are both moving their respective workloads to the cloud rather than handling it through traditional Web servers, according to a report today from SentinelOne. And that presents serious business risk to those entities whose legitimate cloud instances have been compromised by attackers looking to piggyback on their AWS capabilities.Smishing Infection RoutineThe SNS Sender script author or authors, who went by the alias ""ARDUINO_DAS"" from 2020 to 2023, were known to be prolific in the phishing kit scene, though this handle appears to have been abandoned after the operators were accused of scamming phishing kit buyers on the Dark Web, according to SentinelOne. The former alias, however, is still found in all of the threat actors' tools, which are still being used and actively circulated, including the latest campaign from last month.According to Alex Delamotte, senior threat researcher at SenitelOne and author of the report, the SNS Sender attack uses a version of the well-worn ""missed package"" notification lure, claiming to be from the USPS.""I've gotten a lot of these, and I know that a lot of other people have. They say that you've missed a package, and you need to pick it up at the post office,"" Delamotte says, adding that while the campaign casts a wide, non-specific net, senior citizens are most likely to fall prey to it. ""It tells you to sign in and it looks a lot like the real USPS page, but it's collecting the person's name, address, and credit card number.""The text messages contain URLs that lead to phishing pages, which ask individuals to enter their personally identifiable information (PII) and payment-card details. These are then sent to the attacker's server, as well as a Telegram channel. ""It's kind of like a centralized place to see logs that are collected from these phishing kits,"" Delamotte says. ""We've actually seen logs of it. It also logs which phishing kits are used.""Business Risk: The Trouble With Cloud PhishingThe campaign's standout aspect is the use of AWS SNS, according to SentinelOne.""There's a lot of red tape to be able to send SMS messages in the cloud. There are federal regulations and an SMS registration framework known as A2P 10DLC. This framework implements federal guidelines for cloud or software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers to effectively know their customer,"" Delamotte emphasizes.That means that the attackers need to have legitimate, trusted credentials to be able to maintain the campaign. What essentially happens is threat actors will steal an existing businesses cloud credentials, likely because they cannot pass the vetting process to sign up for them on their own. The threat actor will then use those credentials to send the phishing text messages to various users, using the legitimate business' domain.However, there are further hurdles: Compromising any old AWS instance isn't enough — the attackers also need to verify a targeted environment's SNS capabilities.""SNS Sender represents a more narrow approach that relies on the actor having access to a properly configured AWS SNS tenant,"" according to SentinelOne's report. ""Using AWS presents a challenge for this actor. AWS does not allow SMS notifications via SNS by default. For this feature to work, the tenant needs to be removed from the SNS sandbox environment.""All of this carries significant risk for businesses. First of all, the domain-hijacking creates a bad image for the business, because they are the face of the scam to the user. In addition, being hijacked could compromise the SMS capabilities a business has to communicate with its customers: According to Delamotte, an affected organization will likely have to fight to keep its SMS capabilities active.That's especially bad news for organizations that maintain high-volume SMS communications with consumers, such as e-commerce providers or those running loyalty programs.For businesses, avoiding being caught up in SNS Sender comes down to what Delamotte considers to be basic security hygiene: Organizations need to make sure that they're not exposing their own credentials in the cloud, whether that be through code in GitHub or ""improperly secured services.""About the Author(s)You May Also Like",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
iOS Malware Steals Faces to Defeat Biometrics With AI Swaps,"February 15, 2024Chinese hackers have developed a sophisticated banking Trojan for tricking people into giving up their personal IDs, phone numbers, and face scans, which they're then using to log into those victims' bank accounts.The new malware, ""GoldPickaxe,"" was developed by a large (but unidentified) Chinese-language group. Its variants work across iOS and Android devices, masquerading as a government service app in order to trick primarily elderly victims into scanning their faces. The attackers then use those scans to develop deepfakes that can bypass cutting-edge biometric security checks at Southeast Asian banks.In a new report, researchers from Group-IB identified at least one individual whom they believe to be an early victim: a Vietnamese citizen, who earlier this month lost around $40,000 dollars as a result of the ruse.Diligent social engineering and powerful cross-platform malware aside, it seems to be highly effective for two reasons: because deepfake technology has caught up with biometric authentication mechanisms, and because most of us haven't realized that yet.""This is why we see face swaps are a tool of choice for hackers,"" says Andrew Newell, chief scientific officer at iProov. ""It gives the threat actor this incredible level of power and control.""How Chinese Hackers Beat Thai BanksAs the novelist George Orwell famously said, ""The enemy of art is the absence of limitations.""Last March, to combat widespread financial fraud, the Bank of Thailand announced a policy change: All Thai financial institutions must forgo email and SMS, and require facial recognition for any major actions from customers (e.g. opening a new account, adjusting a daily transfer limit, or initiating a transaction of more than 50,000 baht). They started enforcing this new rule, among others, beginning last July.GoldPickaxe, the face scan-beating banking Trojan, first appeared in the wild just three months thereafter.Built upon the foundations of a prior Trojan, ""GoldDigger,"" GoldPickaxe was identified last November by Thailand's Banking Sector CERT, while disguised as ""Digital Pension,"" a real app used by the elderly to receive pensions in digital format from Thailand's Comptroller General'. Under the guise of a government service, the fake app requires victims to scan their faces, upload their government ID cards, and submit their phone numbers.Unlike some other banking trojans, GoldPickaxe doesn't operate as a layer on top of a real financial app, or automatically leverage the data it collects. Rather, as Thai police confirmed in November, it gathers all the information necessary for attackers to, later, glide past authentication checks and manually log into their victims' bank accounts.Combatting Biometric Bank TrojansThat hackers were able to undermine Thailand's latest cyber policy upgrades so efficiently and so quickly does not surprise Newell.""We are now operating on timescales that are much shorter than they were before. We see that more advanced tools come out every week. So I think we really need a massive shift in the banking industry, to acknowledge the fact that the rate of evolution of threats has changed. And that we need a different approach,"" he says.Banks, he says, need to adjust. ""If they have systems that they've put in place, you know, 12 months ago, 18 months ago, does that mean they're really able to handle the threats they're seeing now? If they're not, they need to find a different approach, quickly.""To conclude its report, Group-IB recommends banks implement sophisticated user session monitoring. And to bank customers, it advises: ""avoid clicking on suspicious links, use official app stores to download applications, review the permissions of all apps, avoid adding unknown contacts, verify the legitimacy of bank communications, and act promptly if fraud is suspected by contacting your bank.""About the Author(s)You May Also Like",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

Siemens SIDIS Prime | CISA,"Siemens SIDIS PrimeAs of January 10, 2023, CISA will no longer be updating ICS security advisories for Siemens product vulnerabilities beyond the initial advisory. For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, please see Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY- CVSS v4 9.1- ATTENTION: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity- Vendor: Siemens- Equipment: SIDIS Prime- Vulnerabilities: Use of Insufficiently Random Values, NULL Pointer Dereference, Infinite Loop2. RISK EVALUATIONSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker with access to the network where SIDIS Prime is installed to reuse OPC UA client credentials, create a denial-of-service condition of the SIDIS Prime OPC UA client, or create a denial-of-service condition of the SIDIS Prime TLS service.3. TECHNICAL DETAILS3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTSThe following Siemens products are affected:- SIDIS Prime: All versions prior to V4.0.4003.2 Vulnerability OverviewIn OPC Foundation OPC UA .NET Standard codebase 1.4.357.28, servers do not create sufficiently random numbers in OPCFoundation.NetStandard.Opc.Ua before 1.4.359.31, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to reuse encrypted user credentials sent over the network.A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2019-19135. A base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the ""signature_algorithms_cert"" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognized signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a denial-of-service attack.A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2020-1967. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial-of-service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate. 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token). If an attacker can control both items being compared, then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example, if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL, then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the ""-crl_download"" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However, it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack.A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2020-1971. A base score of 8.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.The BN_mod_sqrt() function in openSSL, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger an infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial-of-service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters.A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2022-0778. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.An infinite loop in OPC UA .NET Standard Stack 1.04.368 allows a remote attackers to cause the application to hang via a crafted message.A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2022-29862. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.3.3 BACKGROUND- CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Multiple Sectors- COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide- COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: Germany3.4 RESEARCHERSiemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.4.

Attackers Exploit Microsoft Security-Bypass Zero-Day Bugs,"February 13, 2024Microsoft's scheduled Patch Tuesday security update for February includes fixes for two zero-day security vulnerabilities under active attack, plus 71 other flaws across a wide range of its products.In all, five of the vulnerabilities for which Microsoft issued a February patch were rated as critical, 66 as important, and two as moderate.The update includes patches for Microsoft Office, Windows, Microsoft Exchange Server, the company's Chromium-based Edge browser, Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Skype for business. Tenable identified 30 of the 73 CVEs as remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities; 16 as enabling privilege escalation; 10 as tied to spoofing errors; nine as enabling distributed denial-of-service attacks; five as information disclosure flaws; and three as security bypass issues.Water Hydra Exploits Zero-Days Targeting Financial TradersA threat actor dubbed as Water Hydra (aka Dark Casino) is currently leveraging one of the zero-day vulnerabilities — an Internet Shortcut Files security feature bypass vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-21412 (CVSS 8.1) — in a malicious campaign targeting organizations in the financial sector.Researchers at Trend Micro — among several who discovered and reported the flaw to Microsoft — described it as tied to a bypass of a previously patched SmartScreen vulnerability (CVE-2023-36025, CVSS 8.8) and affecting all supported Windows versions. Water Hydra actors are using CVE-2024-21412 to gain initial access to systems belonging to financial traders and drop the DarkMe remote access Trojan on them.To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to deliver a malicious file to a targeted user and get them to open it, said Saeed Abbasi, manager of vulnerability researcher at Qualys, in emailed commentary. ""The impact of this vulnerability is profound, compromising security and undermining trust in protective mechanisms like SmartScreen,"" Abbasi said.SmartScreen Bypass Zero-DayThe other zero-day that Microsoft disclosed in this month's security update affects Defender SmartScreen. According to Microsoft, CVE-2024-21351 is a medium-severity bug that allows an attacker to bypass SmartScreen protections and inject code into it to potentially gain remote code execution capabilities. A successful exploit could lead to limited data exposure, systems availability issues, or both, Microsoft said. No details are available on who exactly might be exploiting the bug and for what purpose.In prepared comments for Dark Reading, Mike Walters, president and co-founder of Action1, said the vulnerability is tied to the manner in which Microsoft's Mark of the Web (a feature for identifying untrusted content from the Internet) interacts with the SmartScreen feature. ""For this vulnerability, an attacker must distribute a malicious file to a user and persuade them to open it, allowing them to circumvent the SmartScreen checks and potentially compromise the system's security,"" Walters said.High-Priority BugsAmong the five critical vulnerabilities in the February update, the one that requires priority attention is CVE-2024-21410, a privilege escalation vulnerability in Exchange Server, a favorite target for attackers. An attacker could use the bug to disclose a targeted user's Net-New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) version 2 hash and then relay that credential against an affected Exchange Server and authenticate to it as the user.Flaws like this that disclose sensitive information like NTLM hashes can be very valuable to attackers, said Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable in a statement. ""A Russian-based threat actor leveraged a similar vulnerability to carry out attacks — CVE-2023-23397 is an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook patched in March 2023,"" he said.To patch the flaw, Exchange admins will need to ensure they have installed Exchange Server 2019 Cumulative Update 14 (CU14) update and ensure the Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) feature is enabled, Trend Micro said. The security vendor pointed to an article that Microsoft has published that provides additional information on how to patch the vulnerability.Microsoft has assigned CVE-2024-21410 a maximum severity rating of 9.1 out of 10, which makes it a critical vulnerability. But typically privilege escalation vulnerabilities tend to score relatively low on the CVSS vulnerability rating scale which belies the true nature of the threat they present, said Kev Breen, senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs. ""Despite their low score, [privilege escalation] vulnerabilities are highly sought after by threat actors and used in almost every cyber incident,"" Breen said in a statement. ""Once an attacker has access to a user account through social engineering or some other attack, they will next seek to escalate their permissions either to local admin or domain admin.""Walters from Action1 highlighted CVE-2024-21413, an RCE flaw in Microsoft Outlook as a vulnerability that administrators might want to prioritize from February's batch. The critical severity flaw with a near maximum severity score of 9.8 involves low attack complexity, no user interaction, and no special privileges required for an attacker to exploit it. ""An attacker can exploit this vulnerability via the preview pane in Outlook, allowing them to circumvent Office Protected View and force files to open in edit mode, rather than in the safer protected mode,"" Walters said.Microsoft itself identified the vulnerability as something that attackers are less likely to attack. Nevertheless, Walters said the vulnerability poses a substantial threat for organizations and requires prompt attention.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",emerging threats and attack techniques,vulnerability reports,FALSE
How Nation-State Actors Target Your Business: New Research Exposes Major SaaS Vulnerabilities,"With many of the highly publicized 2023 cyber attacks revolving around one or more SaaS applications, SaaS has become a cause for genuine concern in many boardroom discussions. More so than ever, considering that GenAI applications are, in fact, SaaS applications.Wing Security (Wing), a SaaS security company, conducted an analysis of 493 SaaS-using companies in Q4 of 2023. Their study reveals how companies use SaaS today, and the wide variety of threats that result from that usage. This unique analysis provides rare and important insights into the breadth and depth of SaaS-related risks, but also provides practical tips to mitigate them and ensure SaaS can be widely used without compromising security posture.The TL;DR Version Of SaaS Security2023 brought some now infamous examples of malicious players leveraging or directly targeting SaaS, including the North Korean group UNC4899, 0ktapus ransomware group, and Russian Midnight Blizzard APT, which targeted well-known organizations such as JumpCloud, MGM Resorts, and Microsoft (respectively), and probably many others that often go unannounced.The first insight from this research cements the concept that SaaS is the new supply chain, providing an almost intuitive framework to the importance of securing SaaS usage. These applications are clearly an integral part of the modern organization's set of tools and vendors. That said, long gone are the days when every 3rd party with access to company data had to go through security or IT approval. Even in the most rigorous companies, when a diligent employee needs a quick and efficient solution, they'll look it up and use it to get their jobs' done faster and better. Again, think of the widespread use of GenAI, and the picture is clear.As such, any organization concerned about the security of its supply chain must adopt SaaS security measures. According to the MITRE ATT&CK technique 'Trusted Relationships' (T1199), a supply chain attack occurs when an attacker targets a vendor to exploit it as a means to infiltrate a broader network of companies. By entrusting sensitive data to external SaaS vendors, organizations subject themselves to supply chain risks that reach beyond immediate security concerns.Four Common SaaS RisksThere are various reasons and ways in which SaaS is being targeted. The good news is that most of the risks can be significantly mitigated when monitored and controlled. Basic SaaS security capabilities are even free, suited for organizations that are just beginning to develop their SaaS security posture or need to compare it to their current solution.1) Shadow SaaSThe first problem with SaaS usage is the fact that it often goes completely unnoticed: The number of applications used by organizations is typically 250% larger than what a basic and often-used query of the workspace reveals.Amongst the companies analyzed:- 41% of applications were used by only one individual, resulting in a very long tail of unsanctioned applications.- 1 out of 5 users were utilizing applications not used by anyone else within their organization, creating security and resource strains.- 63% of single-user applications were not even accessed within a 3-month period, begging the question - why keep them connected to company data?- 96.7% of organizations used at least one application that had a security incident in the previous year, solidifying the continuous risk and need for proper mitigation.2) MFA BypassingWing's research indicates a trend where users opt to use a username/password to access the services they need, bypassing the security measures in place (see image 1).|Image 1: From Wing Security's research, bypassing MFA.3) Forgotten tokensUsers grant the applications they need tokens; this is necessary for the SaaS applications to serve their purpose. The problem is that these tokens are often forgotten about after a few or just one use. Wing's research revealed a large presence of unused tokens over a period of 3 months, creating an unnecessarily large attack surface for many customers (Image 2).4) The new risk of Shadow AIIn the beginning of 2023, security teams primarily concentrated on a select few renowned services offering access to AI-based models. However, as the year progressed, thousands of conventional SaaS applications adopted AI models. The research shows that 99.7% of companies were using applications with integrated AI capabilities.Organizations were required to agree to updated terms and conditions permitting these applications to utilize and refine their models using the organizations' most confidential data. Often, these revised terms and conditions slipped under the radar, along with the usage of AI itself.There are different ways in which AI applications may use your data for their training models. This can come in the form of learning your data, storing your data and even having a human manually go over your data to improve the AI model. According to Wing, this capability is often configurable and totally avoidable, provided it is not overlooked.Solving SaaS Security Challenges In 2024The report ends on a positive note, listing 8 ways in which companies can mitigate the growing threat of the SaaS supply chain. Including:- Ongoing shadow IT discovery and management.- Prioritize the remediation of SaaS misconfigurations- Optimize anomaly detection with predefined frameworks, automate when possible.- Discover and monitor all AI-using SaaS applications, and constantly monitor your SaaS for updates in their T&C pertaining to AI usage.For the full list of findings, tips on ensuring safe SaaS usage and a 2024 SaaS security forecast, download the full report here.",vulnerability reports,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
"Volt Typhoon Hits Multiple Electric Utilities, Expands Cyber Activity","February 15, 2024The portion of China's Volt Typhoon advanced persistent threat (APT) that focuses on infiltrating operational technology (OT) networks in critical infrastructure has already performed reconnaissance and enumeration of multiple US-based electric companies, while also targeting electric transmission and distribution organizations in African nations.That's according to OT security specialist Dragos, which found that the OT threat, which it has dubbed ""Voltzite,"" has been ""knocking on the door"" of compromising physical industrial control systems (ICSes) at electric-sector targets, though so far their incursions have been limited to the IT networks that connect to the OT footprint.The findings corroborate recent declarations by the US government that the state-sponsored threat is pre-positioning itself to be able to sow chaos and disrupt the power grid domestically in the case of military conflict.""When we look at Volt Typhoon, that is an A-player team, a strategic adversary, well resourced and very sophisticated,"" said Robert M. Lee, founder and CEO at Dragos, during a media roundtable this week. ""And when we look at what we track, which is Voltzite, that's the OT portion and the OT focus [of that group]. We can validate US government's focus on Volt Typhoon, and we can validate their targeting of strategic electric sites.""Case Study: Volt Typhoon Lurks Inside Midsize Power CompanyIn one case that Dragos investigated, Voltzite compromised a midsize electric utility in the US and managed to stay hidden ""for well over 300 days,"" according to Lee.""It was very clear that the adversary, though contained to the enterprise IT network, was explicitly trying to get into the OT network there,"" he explained. ""They were knocking on the door, they were doing everything that you'd expect to explicitly get into the power operations networks.""Further analysis showed that the APT was hunting for data that could aid its efforts to cross over into physical control systems.""I can confirm that they were stealing a lot of OT-specific data and insights, and SCADA-related information and GIS-related information, and things that would be useful in future disruptive attacks,"" Lee explained. ""It was clear that Voltzite was specifically thinking about key targets and how to take down power in the future, based on what they were stealing.""To help keep the threat contained, Lee said the firm packaged up its threat intelligence findings from the incident response, sharing them with other potential Voltzite targets as well as the federal government.Volt Typhoon Expands ActivitySince being publicly outed in May 2023, Volt Typhoon (aka Bronze Silhouette, Vanguard Panda, and UNC3236) is known to have compromised the US territory of Guam, telecom providers, military bases, and the United States emergency management organization, among others.Dragos' own investigation uncovered evidence of Volt Typhoon expansion, and that Voltzite specifically had not only cast a wide net across US power companies and some targets in Africa, but that it overlaps with UTA0178, a threat activity cluster tracked by Volexity that was exploiting Ivanti VPN zero-day vulnerabilities at ICS targets back in December.Further, last month Dragos discovered it conducting extensive reconnaissance of a US telecommunications provider's external network gateways and found evidence that Voltzite compromised a large US city's emergency services geospatial information systems (GIS) network.""What is concerning to us is not just that they've deployed very specific capabilities to do disruption,"" Lee said. ""The concern is the targets they have picked, across satellite, telecommunications, and electric power generation, transmission, and distribution,"" which he stressed are cherry-picked for their ability to cause the most disruption to American lives should they be taken offline.Voltzite's Stealthy Cyber-Intrusion TacticsThe Dragos investigation showed that Voltzite uses various techniques for credential access and lateral movement once inside a network. Its hallmark, like that of the broader Volt Typhoon threat, is using legitimate tools and living off the land (LotL) to avoid signature detection.One tactic includes the use of csvde.exe, a native Windows binary used for importing and exporting data from Active Directory Domain Services using the CSV file format. In other cases, it uses Volume Shadow Copies (i.e., cloned images of the Windows operating system that can be used as backups), and the extraction of the NTDS.dit Active Directory database from a domain controller, which enumerates user accounts, groups, and computers, and most importantly, contains the hashes of user passwords.Source: Dragos""Under normal circumstances, the NTDS.dit file cannot be opened or copied as it is in use by Active Directory on the machine,"" according to Dragos' annual OT threat report, which is due to be released next week. ""To circumvent this protection, adversaries commonly use the Volume Shadow Copy Service to create a cloned image of the operating system and save it to a disk. Then the adversary can exfiltrate the copy of NTDS.dit residing in the shadow copy with no issues, as that file version is not in use by any processes.""After that, Voltzite can perform hash cracking or use ""pass the hash"" techniques to authenticate as a user.While Voltzite is known for using minimal tooling, it has used the FRP reverse proxy tool and multiple Web shells to channel data to a command-and-control (C2) server, according to the Dragos report, which contains a list of the LotL binaries that Voltzite is using.Utilities Should Act Now on Cyber DefenseWhile its disruptive intentions are clear, so far Dragos has not seen Voltzite successfully display actions or capabilities that could disrupt, degrade, or destroy ICS/OT assets or operations. That doesn't mean things won't change, however.Aura Sabadus, an energy markets specialist at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS), notes that attacks against energy utilities more than doubled between 2020 and 2022, with hackers disabling transmission systems or power plants. With new entrants like Volt Typhoon representing an existential threat to critical gas, electricity and water infrastructure, more investment will be necessary to ward off the worst-case scenario.""Although many utilities across the globe dedicate significant budgets to fight cyberattacks, many companies remain in reactive mode and do not seem to have a long-term strategy,"" she says. ""Large investments are needed to respond to the growing risks, but at the same time they may also be eating into the budgets that are required to scale up renewable forms of generation.""To bolster protection, Dragos recommends that organizations implement the SANS Institute's 5 Critical Controls for World-Class OT Cybersecurity:Craft an operations-informed incident response (IR) plan with focused system integrity and recovery capabilities during an attack — exercises designed to reinforce risk scenarios and use cases tailored to the ICS environment.Deploy architectures that support visibility, log collection, asset identification, segmentation, industrial ""demilitarized zones,"" and process-communication enforcement.Continuous network security monitoring of the ICS environment with protocol-aware toolsets and ""system-of-systems"" interaction analysis capabilities used to inform operations of potential risks to control.Identify and take inventory of all remote access points and allowed destination environments, on-demand access, and multifactor authentication (MFA), where possible, jump host environments.Employ risk-based vulnerability management.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

Strata Identity Reins in Global Access and Compliance Challenges With Cross-Border Orchestration Recipes,"February 15, 2024PRESS RELEASEBOULDER, Colo., Feb 15, 2024 - Strata Identity, the Identity Orchestration company, today announced Global Access Orchestration Recipes that manage the complex identity relationships and processes associated with meeting data sovereignty and privacy compliance requirements for organizations with global operations. Together with Strata’s Maverics Identity Orchestration platform, these identity orchestration recipes ensure that data accessed across multiple identity providers (IDPs) and cloud platforms remains sovereign, resident, and local to comply with regional regulations.These new orchestration recipes and additional resources on solving global access and identity management challenges are available on the Strata Global Access Cookbook page.Multinational organizations face three distinct global access and compliance challenges. Firstly, they must simultaneously satisfy an intricate web of data privacy and protection regulations in each jurisdiction where they operate, which includes managing identities and access policies across regional IDPs. Meanwhile, companies with international customers must ensure compliance with foreign data privacy laws, such as the European GDPR, regardless of where their headquarters are located. Finally, they must proactively enforce data storage policies to avoid countries where governments can lawfully (or otherwise) seize data.“Every employee, no matter where they are in the world, needs shared access to a common set of applications. Meanwhile data residency regulations — and the need to support multiple regional IDPs and identity policies — make access hard to secure and control. But it doesn’t have to be,” said Eric Olden, CEO of Strata Identity. “Strata’s Maverics was purpose-built for the needs of multinational enterprises because it is optimized for multiple clouds and IDPs - across the globe. Our orchestration recipes enable customers to enforce granular policies for identity sovereignty to comply with local laws, identity residency of physical data, and language localization of identity.”Strata’s Global Access Orchestration Recipes and CapabilitiesThe first of Strata’s global access recipes, “Secure & control cross-border access to a global resource,” is available now. Strata’s Maverics and additional global access orchestration recipes will provide the following capabilities:Support for region-specific IDPs to provide users controlled access to common apps and keep international customer data compliant with local regulations to avoid GDPR, CCPA, and other region and country-specific violations. Maverics’ service extensions enable organizations to build multilingual customer journeys that keep customer data where it belongs.Protect global data from local data seizure in countries and regions with far-reaching data privacy and access laws. The Maverics Cloud is available in six global regions: the US, Canada, the UK, the EU, Brazil, and Australia, and can be used to set up multiple instances in different regions to control data policies at the local in-country level.Provide cross-region visibility into siloed identity data for accurate auditing with comprehensive reports demonstrating compliance with local data regulations.Improve performance and user experience using Maverics’ distributed air-gap architecture that enables Identity Orchestration to be deployed near apps and avoid round trip latency to access data.Provide users with a familiar log-in experience to global resources they need while controlling region-specific access in the background. Behind the scenes, Maverics evaluates the app policy and directs the user to their IDP.Enable administrators to define the policy that enforces authentication to each IDP and configure Maverics as an authentication gateway to direct users to the appropriate IDP.AvailabilityThe Maverics recipes for Global Access are available immediately from Strata and its business partners worldwide.About Strata IdentityStrata Identity is the leader in Identity Orchestration for multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud. The orchestration recipe-powered Maverics platform enables organizations to integrate and control incompatible identity systems with an identity fabric that does not change the user experience or require rewriting apps. By decoupling applications from identity, Maverics makes it possible to implement modern authentication, like passwordless, and enforce consistent access policies without refactoring apps. The company’s founders created the IDQL (Identity Query Language) standard and Hexa open-source software for multi-cloud policy orchestration and are co-authors of the SAML standard for SSO federation.

Cobalt's New Report Uncovers a Big Shift in Cybersecurity Strategy,"February 15, 2024PRESS RELEASESAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Cobalt, the pioneers of Pentest as a Service (PtaaS), empowering businesses to operate fearlessly and innovate securely, has today announced the release of the inaugural OffSec Shift Report. The report highlights the evolving state of cybersecurity risks and uncovers a huge trend towards blended offensive/defensive approaches, and the improved protection being realized by those at the forefront of this shift.After surveying more than 1,200 security professionals employed across DevOps, SecOps, IT Security, Network Security, Cloud Security, or InfoSec roles in the U.S. and U.K., Cobalt found:Increases in defensive (blue team) measures helping, but not enough: While 47% report they increased their defensive cyber security spend, 41% reported not feeling confident in their company's current defensive cybersecurity measures; a statement that those who decreased their security budget in the last 12 months were 81% more likely than average to make. Indicating an important shift, 74% agree that defensive measures are not enough and that their company's cybersecurity would be stronger if more budget were allocated towards offensive measures.The Offsec (red team) shift is underway: 84% expect to increase the budget for red team operations in 2024, with an average increase of 33%. This comes off an already impressive growth for offensive security, where 63% say their team conducted more red team exercises in 2023 than they did in 2022.The impact of increased offensive security testing is being seen: 75% say their company conducts more regular penetration testing annually now than they did last year. Of those, 82% agree that increased penetration testing decreased successful breaches by over 50% in the past 12 months. And 86% say that increased penetration testing significantly sped up their team's incident response.With breaches more costly, organizations work to find the perfect shade of purple: 75% report that the financial impact of data breaches has increased, with each costing companies an average of $1.65M. This reality has organizations searching for the right shade of purple. Of those who invested in purple team operations in 2023, 93% say that the integration of their red and blue teams enhanced their company's cybersecurity capabilities. And they believe the ideal split looks like a 54% defensive and 46% offensive operational split.""This report shows the importance of the OffSec shift. This isn't a passing trend. It's the necessary reaction to our evolving threat landscape and market conditions that require real value for each dollar spent on security control. Every organization needs to consider how it brings offensive measures to the forefront of their cybersecurity strategies,"" said Caroline Wong, Chief Strategy Officer at Cobalt. ""As the attack surface at each organization continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, investing in comprehensive security solutions is paramount to safeguarding digital assets and ensuring the resilience of businesses against ever-changing risks.""In today's evolving threat landscape, it is more important than ever for businesses to develop mature offensive cybersecurity measures in addition to their existing defensive controls. This combined effort allows businesses to proactively identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers while ensuring protection against existing threats to safeguard sensitive data and maintain operational continuity.The OffSec Shift Report is the first report of its kind.

Chinese Hackers Using Deepfakes in Advanced Mobile Banking Malware Attacks,"A Chinese-speaking threat actor codenamed GoldFactory has been attributed to the development of highly sophisticated banking trojans, including a previously undocumented iOS malware called GoldPickaxe that's capable of harvesting identity documents, facial recognition data, and intercepting SMS.""The GoldPickaxe family is available for both iOS and Android platforms,"" Singapore-headquartered Group-IB said in an extensive report shared with The Hacker News. ""GoldFactory is believed to be a well-organized Chinese-speaking cybercrime group with close connections to Gigabud.""Active since at least mid-2023, GoldFactory is also responsible for another Android-based banking malware called GoldDigger and its enhanced variant GoldDiggerPlus as well as GoldKefu, an embedded trojan inside GoldDiggerPlus.Social engineering campaigns distributing the malware have been found to target the Asia-Pacific region, specifically Thailand and Vietnam, by masquerading as local banks and government organizations.In these attacks, prospective victims are sent smishing and phishing messages and guided to switch the conversation to instant messaging apps like LINE, before sending bogus URLs that lead to the deployment of GoldPickaxe on the devices.Some of these malicious apps targeting Android are hosted on counterfeit websites resembling Google Play Store pages or fake corporate websites to complete the installation process.GoldPickaxe for iOS, however, employs a different distribution scheme, with successive iterations leveraging Apple's TestFlight platform and booby-trapped URLs that prompt users to download an Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile to grant complete control over the iOS devices and install the rogue app.The sophistication of GoldPickaxe is also evident in the fact that it's designed to get around security measures imposed by Thailand that require users to confirm larger transactions using facial recognition to prevent fraud.""GoldPickaxe prompts the victim to record a video as a confirmation method in the fake application,"" security researchers Andrey Polovinkin and Sharmine Low said. ""The recorded video is then used as raw material for the creation of deepfake videos facilitated by face-swapping artificial intelligence services.""Furthermore, the Android and iOS flavors of the malware are equipped to collect the victim's ID documents and photos, intercept incoming SMS messages, and proxy traffic through the compromised device. It's suspected that the GoldFactory actors use their own devices to sign-in to the bank application and perform unauthorized fund transfers.That having said, the iOS variant exhibits fewer functionalities when compared to its Android counterpart owing to the closed nature of the iOS operating system and relatively stricter nature of iOS permissions.The Android version – considered an evolutionary successor of GoldDiggerPlus – also poses as over 20 different applications from Thailand's government, the financial sector, and utility companies to steal login credentials from these services. However, it's currently not clear what the threat actors do with this information.Another notable aspect of the malware is its abuse of Android's accessibility services to log keystrokes and extract on-screen content.GoldDigger also shares code-level similarities to GoldPickaxe, although it is chiefly designed to steal banking credentials, while the latter is geared more towards gathering of personal information from victims. No GoldDigger artifacts aimed at iOS devices have been identified to date.""The primary feature of GoldDigger is that it targets over 50 applications from Vietnamese financial companies, including their packages' names in the trojan,"" the researchers said. ""Whenever the targeted applications open, it will save the text displayed or written on the UI, including passwords, when they are entered.""The base version of GoldDigger, which was first discovered in June 2023 and continues to be still in circulation, has since paved the way for more upgraded variants, including GoldDiggerPlus, which comes embedded with another trojan APK component dubbed GoldKefu, to unleash the malicious actions.GoldDiggerPlus is said to have emerged in September 2023, with GoldKefu impersonating a popular Vietnamese messaging app to siphon banking credentials associated with 10 financial institutions.The Android trojan, which is used in conjunction with GoldKefu, uses fake overlays to collect the login information if the most recently opened application belongs to the target list, unlike GoldDigger which relies mainly on Android's accessibility services.Goldkefu also integrates with the Agora Software Development Kit (SDK) to facilitate interactive voice and video calls and trick victims into contacting a bogus bank customer service by sending fake alerts that induce a false sense of urgency by claiming that a fund transfer to the tune of 3 million Thai Baht has taken place on their accounts.If anything, the development is a sign that the mobile malware landscape remains a lucrative market for cybercriminals looking for quick financial gain, even as they find ways to circumvent defensive measures erected by banks to counter such threats.

Microsoft says it fixed a Windows Metadata server issue that’s still broken,"Microsoft claims to have fixed Windows Metadata connection issues which continue to plague customers, causing problems for users trying to manage their printers and other hardware.When new hardware is added to a Windows computer, the operating system connects to a Microsoft-operated website called the Windows Metadata and Internet Services (WMIS) to download metadata packages associated with the particular hardware.""When the operating system detects a new device, it queries an online service called the Windows Metadata and Internet Services (WMIS) for a metadata package for the device,"" reads a description of the WMIS site.""If a device metadata package is available, the Device Metadata Retrieval Client (DMRC) that runs on the local computer downloads the package from WMIS and installs the package on the local computer.""These metadata packages contain information about the hardware, such as its model name, description, OEM provider, various properties and actions, and the device's associated hardware categories.This information is then used in various Window dialogs, such as the Devices and Printers settings page.Windows Metadata services unavailableHowever, since November, Windows has been unable to connect to the Metadata service located at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252669&clcid=0x409, which redirects to http://dmd.metaservices.microsoft.com/metadata.svc.When visiting the URL from a browser, the site shows an error stating ""502 Bad Gateway,"" indicating something is wrong with the site.As reported by BornCity in December, this caused occasional Event ID 201 connection error events and repeated Event ID 131 errors for 'DeviceSetupManager' to appear in the Windows Event Viewer logs, with a description of ""Metadata staging failed, result=0x80070490"".BleepingComputer was told by an admin dealing with these errors that the inability to connect to the Windows Metadata services is causing problems in their organization.These problems include 4-5 minute delays when troubleshooting printer problems or adding and deleting print queues, usually leading to support tickets being filed about the issues.For a large organization with thousands of Windows devices, this can quickly become a problem for IT staff.However, Windows admins had short-lived happiness this week, as Microsoft released the Windows 10 KB5034763 and Windows 11 KB5034765 cumulative updates as part of the February 2024 Patch Tuesday with what they claim is a fix for the Window Metadata connection issues.These updates both state that they resolve the problems connecting to the Windows Metadata servers, and as an added bonus, the connection will be over HTTPS, making them more secure.""This update addresses an issue that affects the download of device metadata,"" reads both support bulletins.""Downloads from the Windows Metadata and Internet Services (WMIS) over HTTPS are now more secure.""After installing the updates, BleepingComputer can confirm that the new Metadata server URL, https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=2257403&clcid=0x409, is using HTTPs and redirects to the new URL https://devicemetadataservice.trafficmanager.net/dms/metadata.svc?LinkID=2257403&clcid=0x409, which also uses HTTPs.However, Microsoft has failed to associate an IP address to devicemetadataservice.trafficmanager.net in DNS, causing connection attempts to fail.BleepingComputer is now told that this is causing the Event Log to show repeated Event ID 201 connection errors, stating, ""A connection to the Windows Metadata and Internet Services (WMIS) could not be established.""Other Windows admins report seeing similar Event ID 201 errors in Event Viewer after installing the update.""Same here - no 131's anymore but **** of 201's,"" reads a post on the Microsoft forums.It is unclear why Microsoft disabled the Metadata servers in the first place and why they are not bringing them back online as expected.BleepingComputer contacted Microsoft about this issue yesterday but has not received a response to our email.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

UK dark web 'ban' debate sparked by Brianna Ghey murder,"Cutting kids off from the dark web – the solution can only ever be socialExpert weighs in after Brianna Ghey murder amid worrying rates of child cybercrimeThe murder of 16-year-old schoolgirl Brianna Ghey has kickstarted a debate around limiting children's access to the dark web in the UK, with experts highlighting the difficulty in achieving this.Ciaran Martin, the National Cyber Security Centre's first CEO and current Oxford University professor, weighed into the discussion on Thursday, saying that there is no single technology-based solution and that there should be a greater focus on the dark web in the country's schools.The debate was spun up following an interview with Esther Ghey, mother to Brianna, whose murder by two of her peers, also aged 16, has rocked the UK for the past year. It was revealed in the recent trial of Brianna's two child killers that one had accessed real-life torture and murder material on the ""horror-filled corner of the internet,"" as BBC Radio 4 presenter Nick Robinson put it, which raised questions about the accessibility of the dark web for children.In addition to criticizing the Online Safety Act for not going far enough to protect children, Ghey is also campaigning for social media to be banned on smartphones for those under 16 years of age.""With this absolutely horrible case in mind, and everyone's heart must go out to the whole family, I think we would want to look seriously at what can be done,"" said Martin, discussing access to the dark web on Thursday's Today show.""There are technological limitations. So if you said, for example, 'just block access to dark web browsers,' that's not really possible in the way that the UK internet works because communication service providers – if you're using one of these things – won't know what your IP address is.""So there are technological limitations, but I don't want to be completely defeatist.""He went on to highlight the UK's strict rules around hosting and propagating harmful content online, such as terrorist material, that are already in place.Just this week, a Runcorn mechanic was sentenced to 16 years in prison for running The Annex child abuse site – an example of the country's intolerance of this sort of activity.""Of course, we criminalize the possession of child [sex abuse] images, which are often from the dark web,"" Martin added. ""But also I think there is a danger in trying to declare that there must be a technological solution to problems that often have a technological aspect, including what technology does to our minds, but they also have a deeply sociological aspect.""So parents will need to be asking their children if they know what the dark web is and if they're using it. They could be searching devices for Tor. We educate children in schools about sharing indecent images when they're underage, we should be educating them about the dark web as well. It's a really complicated problem with no single tech solution.""One of the obvious difficulties of limiting access to the dark web for anyone in the UK is the Tor browser, required for accessing corners of the deep web and the dark web.The fact that it's also used for benign and legitimate reasons also presents an argument to not limit its availability. Tor and the deep web enables people to anonymously access information and resources unavailable to those who live in authoritarian governments, for example, or those in war-torn countries such as Ukraine.When it comes to the Online Safety Act, concern remains that one particular passage, section 122 [PDF], allows Ofcom to demand that online service providers scan online communications, which would effectively not allow the implementation of encryption.Is your kid a little cybercriminal?The Today show debate comes against the backdrop of concerns among UK authorities about children increasingly engaging in cybercrime.- FYI: Tor Browser is very much still a thing and getting updates- DEA nabs $150M from dark web drug lord based... in Coventry- Walmart runs creepy 'advergame' on Roblox, where kids can make toy wish lists- Children should have separate sections in social media sites, says UK coronerThe National Crime Agency (NCA) issued a call on Thursday for parents and teachers to take a proactive role in educating young people about the dangers of engaging in cybercrime.The NCA has spent years consistently campaigning to raise awareness of cybercriminal behavior among the younger population. It previously pinpointed 12 to 15-year-old boys as the primary target of education efforts, and noticed the average age of suspects subject to cybercrime investigations was 17.Now the authority says one in five (20 percent) of children in the UK aged between ten and 16 have demonstrated behavior that would violate the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA). The figure is slightly higher for those who are active gamers, it added, with one in four exhibiting illegal behaviors.Many children may not be aware of the criminality associated with their actions, especially with low-level offences, but there exists a very real potential for this activity to grow into more serious cybercrime.For gamers, even buying a skin for their in-game character using their parents' saved credit card details without consent would be a violation of the CMA. Using off-the-shelf tools to perform DDoS attacks, for example, or accessing a protected server are other common examples of these low-level offenses.Being found guilty under the CMA can have serious consequences for young offenders that could impact their employability in later life by having a criminal record or being expelled from school, or both.The NCA is aligned with Martin's recommendation that the first port of call should be to focus on education from a young age, nurturing a child's curiosity and skills in positive ways.Call us immediately if your child uses Kali Linux, squawks West Mids PoliceREAD MORE""Many young people are getting involved in cybercrime without realizing that they are breaking the law. Our message to these teenagers is simple – don't play games with your future,"" said Paul Foster, NCA deputy director and head of the National Cyber Crime Unit.""Whether you engage in this behavior knowingly or without realizing, you are committing an offense – and could face serious consequences for your actions.""We'd encourage any concerned parents and teachers to speak to young people with an interest in tech, help them understand the dangers, and highlight the many rewarding and varied careers available to them.""Our Cyber Choices team are here to help children, teachers, and parents with advice and guidance."" ®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Russian APT Turla Wields Novel Backdoor Malware Against Polish NGOs,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.A spate of recent cyber-espionage attacks showcases Turla's brand-new modular custom malware, and an expansion of the state-sponsored group's scope of targets.February 15, 2024Russia-sponsored advanced persistent threat group (APT) Turla is now targeting Polish NGOs in a cyberespionage campaign that uses a freshly developed backdoor with modular capabilities, signaling an expansion of the scope of its attacks against supporters of the Ukrainian war effort.According to a Cisco Talos blog post published today on Turla (aka Snake, Urobouros, Venomous Bear, or WaterBug), the backdoor used in the attacks, dubbed ""TinyTurla-NG,"" has functionalities very much like the APT's known custom malware, the similarly named TinyTurla. It acts as a ""last-chance"" backdoor ""that is left behind to be used when all other unauthorized access/backdoor mechanisms have failed or been detected on the infected systems,"" Cisco Talos researchers wrote in the post.TinyTurla-NG Custom Malware Goes ModularLike TinyTurla before it, TinyTurla-NG is a service DLL that's started via svchost.exe. However, the code of the malware is new, and different malware features are distributed via different threads in the implementation process, something that sets it apart from its predecessor.The APT also hosts different PowerShell scripts and arbitrary commands that can be executed on the victim machine according to the attackers' needs, another deviation from previous backdoor capabilities, the researchers said. And, it provides added capabilities such as such as the execution of commands via choice of two mechanisms — PowerShell or Windows Command Line Interface.""This indicates that Turla is modularizing their malware into various components, likely to avoid detection and blocking of a single bulky backdoor responsible for everything on the infected endpoint,"" a Cisco Talos researcher told Dark Reading.TinyTurla-NG also deploys a previously unknown PowerShell-based implant dubbed TurlaPower-NG aimed specifically at exfiltrating files that may be of interest to attackers, signaling another shift in the APT's tactics. In the attacks on Polish NGOs, Turla used the PowerShell implant to secure the password databases of popular management software, ""indicating a concerted effort for Turla to steal login credentials,"" the researcher says.Turla: Old Dog, Old & New TricksTurla is an experienced APT, operating for a number of years in attacks believed to be on behalf of the Russian government. The group has used zero-days, legitimate software, and other techniques to deploy backdoors in systems belonging to militaries and governments, diplomatic entities, and technology and research organizations. In one case, it was even linked, through its Kazuar backdoor, to the now-infamous SolarWinds breach.The earliest compromise date of this latest campaign against Ukraine-supporting Polish NGOs was Dec. 18, and it remained active until as recently as Jan. 27 of this year, according to researchers. There are some indications, however, that it could have even started earlier, in November.Though TinyTurla-NG and TurlaPower-NG are new forms of custom Turla malware used in the campaign, the group continues to employ old tactics as well, particularly for command-and control (C2). For instance, it continues to leverage compromised WordPress-based websites as C2s to host and operate the malware.""The operators use different websites running vulnerable WordPress versions (versions including 4.4.20, 5.0.21, 5.1.18 and 5.7.2), which allowed the upload of PHP files containing the C2 code,"" according to the post.Defending Against Sophisticated APT CyberattacksCisco Talos included a list of both hashes and domains in its list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) for the latest Turla campaign, as well as a list of security solutions that can provide coverage for organizations worried about being targeted.Overall, the researchers recommend that organizations use ""a layered defense model"" that allows for detection and blocking of malicious activity from initial compromise to final payload deployment to defend against sophisticated APT threats, the Cisco Talos researcher says.""It is imperative that organizations detect and protect against such highly motivated and sophisticated adversaries across multiple attack surfaces,"" the researcher says.Cisco Talos also recommends that organizations use hands-on-keyboard activities such as archiving of files of interest and subsequent exfiltration to further protect themselves against targeted attacks.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

"Zeus, IcedID malware gangs leader pleads guilty, faces 40 years in prison","Ukrainian national Vyacheslav Igorevich Penchukov, one of the heads of the notorious JabberZeus cybercrime gang, has pleaded guilty to charges related to his leadership roles in the Zeus and IcedID malware groups.Penchukov (also known as 'tank' and 'father') was arrested in Switzerland in October 2022 while traveling to meet his wife in Geneva and extradited to the United States in 2023.The U.S. Department of Justice first charged him in 2012 for his involvement in the Zeus malware operation and the theft of millions of dollars using personal identification numbers, bank account numbers, credentials, and other sensitive info stolen from infected devices.Multiple sources also told BleepingComputer that Penchukov was part of the leadership of the Maze and Egregor ransomware operations. Maze was the first ransomware gang involved in double-extortion attacks where stolen data was used as leverage to pressure victims.Maze ransomware was later rebranded to Egregor and Sekhmet to evade law enforcement. Despite this, Penchukov was among the suspects arrested in January 2021 by Ukrainian police as part of a joint international operation targeting the Egregor ransomware gang.However, as investigative journalist Brian Krebs reported, he evaded prosecution using his political connections, including the late son of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.Penchukov was also part of the leadership of the IcedID (aka Bokbot) malware operation after being added to the FBI's Cyber Most Wanted List between November 2018 and February 2021.He and his co-conspirators used the malware to steal the victims' sensitive information, including banking account credentials, and to provide other cybercriminals with access to compromised systems to deploy additional malicious payloads like ransomware.""Vyacheslav Igorevich Penchukov was a leader of two prolific malware groups that infected thousands of computers with malicious software. These criminal groups stole millions of dollars from their victims and even attacked a major hospital with ransomware, leaving it unable to provide critical care to patients for over two weeks,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri.""Before his arrest and extradition to the United States, the defendant was a fugitive on the FBI's most wanted list for nearly a decade.""Penchukov entered a guilty plea to one charge of conspiracy related to racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act for his leadership role in the Zeus operation and to another charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for his leadership role in the IcedID malware group.Scheduled for sentencing on May 9, Penchukov faces a potential maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment for each count.CommentsNoneRain - 1 day ago40y would be awesome.

RansomHouse gang automates VMware ESXi attacks with new MrAgent tool,"The RansomHouse ransomware operation has created a new tool named 'MrAgent' that automates the deployment of its data encrypter across multiple VMware ESXi hypervisors.RansomHouse is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that emerged in December 2021 and is using double extortion tactics. In May 2022, the operation set up a dedicated victim extortion page on the dark web.Although the RansomHouse gang was not as active as more infamous groups like LockBit, ALPHV/Blackcat, Play, or Clop, Trellix reports that it targeted large-sized organizations throughout last year.MrAgent vs. ESXiRansomware groups target ESXi servers because they deploy and serve virtual computers that typically hold valuable data that can be used in the subsequent extortion process.Also, ESXi servers often run critical applications and services for businesses, including databases and email servers, so the operational disruption from the ransomware attack is maximized.Trellix analysts in collaboration with Northwave have spotted a new binary used in RansomHouse attacks that appears to be specifically designed for streamlining the gangs attacks on ESXi systems.The sample was first discovered by researcher Florian Roth, while MalwareHunterTeam was the first to tweet about it in September 2023.MrAgent's core function is to identify the host system, turn off its firewall, and then automate the ransomware deployment process across multiple hypervisors simultaneously, compromising all managed VMs.The tool supports custom configurations for ransomware deployment received directly from the command and control (C2) server.These configurations include setting passwords on the hypervisor, configuring the encrypter command and its arguments, scheduling an encryption event, and changing the welcome message displayed on the hypervisor's monitor (to display a ransom notice).MrAgent can also execute local commands on the hypervisor received from the C2 again to delete files, drop active SSH sessions to prevent interference during the encryption process and send back information about the running VMs.By disabling the firewall and potentially dropping non-root SSH sessions, MrAgent minimizes the chances of detection and intervention by administrators while simultaneously increasing the impact of the attack by targeting all reachable VMs at once.Trellix says it has spotted a Windows version of MrAgent, which retains the same core functionality but features OS-specific adaptations such as using PowerShell for certain tasks.Using the MrAgent tool across different platforms shows RansomHouse's intention to extend the tool's applicability and maximize the impact of their campaigns when the target uses both Windows and Linux systems.""The efforts to (further) automate the steps that are otherwise often executed manually shows both the interest and willingness of the attacking affiliate to target large networks,"" Trellix says in the report.The security implications of tools like MrAgent are severe, so defenders must implement comprehensive and robust security measures, including regular software updates, strong access controls, network monitoring, and logging to defend against such threats.Update 2/16 - Post updated to give credit to researchers spotting MrAgent firstPost a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

Ivanti Pulse Secure Found Using 11-Year-Old Linux Version and Outdated Libraries,"A reverse engineering of the firmware running on Ivanti Pulse Secure appliances has revealed numerous weaknesses, once again underscoring the challenge of securing software supply chains.Eclypsiusm, which acquired firmware version 9.1.18.2-24467.1 as part of the process, said the base operating system used by the Utah-based software company for the device is CentOS 6.4.""Pulse Secure runs an 11-year-old version of Linux which hasn't been supported since November 2020,"" the firmware security company said in a report shared with The Hacker News.The development comes as threat actors are capitalizing on a number of security flaws discovered in Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA gateways to deliver a wide range of malware, including web shells, stealers, and backdoors.The vulnerabilities that have come under active exploitation in recent months comprise CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887, and CVE-2024-21893. Last week, Ivanti also disclosed another bug in the software (CVE-2024-22024) that could permit threat actors to access otherwise restricted resources without any authentication.In an alert published yesterday, web infrastructure company Akamai said it has observed ""significant scanning activity"" targeting CVE-2024-22024 starting February 9, 2024, following the publication of a proof-of-concept (PoC) by watchTowr.Eclypsium said it leveraged a PoC exploit for CVE-2024-21893 that was released by Rapid7 earlier this month to obtain a reverse shell to the PSA3000 appliance, subsequently exporting the device image for follow-on analysis using the EMBA firmware security analyzer.This not only uncovered a number of outdated packages – corroborating previous findings from security researcher Will Dormann – but also a number of vulnerable libraries that are cumulatively susceptible to 973 flaws, out of which 111 have publicly known exploits.|Number of scanning requests per day targeting CVE-2024-22024Perl, for instance, hasn't been updated since version 5.6.1, which was released 23 years ago on April 9, 2001. The Linux kernel version is 2.6.32, which reached end-of-life (EoL) as of March 2016.""These old software packages are components in the Ivanti Connect Secure product,"" Eclypsium said. ""This is a perfect example as to why visibility into digital supply chains is important and why enterprise customers are increasingly demanding SBOMs from their vendors.""Furthermore, a deeper examination of the firmware unearthed 1,216 issues in 76 shell scripts, 5,218 vulnerabilities in 5,392 Python files, in addition to 133 outdated certificates.The issues don't end there, for Eclypsium found a ""security hole"" in the logic of the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) that Ivanti has recommended its customers to use in order to look for indicators of compromise (IoCs).Specifically, the script has been found to exclude over a dozen directories such as /data, /etc, /tmp, and /var from being scanned, thereby hypothetically allowing an attacker to deploy their persistent implants in one of these paths and still pass the integrity check. The tool, however, scans the /home partition that stores all product-specific daemons and configuration files.As a result, deploying the Sliver post-exploitation framework to the /data directory and executing ICT reports no issues, Eclypsium discovered, suggesting that the tool provides a ""false sense of security.""It's worth noting that threat actors have also been observed tampering with the built-in ICT on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure devices in an attempt to sidestep detection.In a theoretical attack demonstrated by Eclypsium, a threat actor could drop their next-stage tooling and store the harvested information in the /data partition and then abuse another zero-day flaw to gain access to the device and exfiltrate the data staged previously, all the while the integrity tool detects no signs of anomalous activity.""There must be a system of checks and balances that allows customers and third-parties to validate product integrity and security,"" the company said. ""The more open this process is, the better job we can do to validate the digital supply chain, namely the hardware, firmware, and software components used in their products.""""When vendors do not share information and/or operate a closed system, validation becomes difficult, as does visibility. Attackers will most certainly, as evidenced recently, take advantage of this situation and exploit the lack of controls and visibility into the system.""",vulnerability reports,vulnerability reports,TRUE

Malicious 'SNS Sender' Script Abuses AWS for Bulk Smishing Attacks,"A malicious Python script known as SNS Sender is being advertised as a way for threat actors to send bulk smishing messages by abusing Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Notification Service (SNS).The SMS phishing messages are designed to propagate malicious links that are designed to capture victims' personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card details, SentinelOne said in a new report, attributing it to a threat actor named ARDUINO_DAS.""The smishing scams often take the guise of a message from the United States Postal Service (USPS) regarding a missed package delivery,"" security researcher Alex Delamotte said.SNS Sender is also the first tool observed in the wild that leverages AWS SNS to conduct SMS spamming attacks. SentinelOne said that it identified links between ARDUINO_DAS and more than 150 phishing kits offered for sale.The malware requires a list of phishing links stored in a file named links.txt in its working directory, in addition to a list of AWS access keys, the phone numbers to target, the sender ID (aka display name), and the content of the message.The mandatory inclusion of sender ID for sending the scam texts is noteworthy because support for sender IDs varies from country to country. This suggests that the author of SNS Sender is likely from a country where the sender ID is a conventional practice.""For example, carriers in the United States don't support sender IDs at all, but carriers in India require senders to use sender IDs,"" Amazon says in its documentation.There is evidence to suggest that this operation may have been active since at least July 2022, going by bank logs containing references to ARDUINO_DAS that have been shared on carding forums like Crax Pro.A vast majority of the phishing kits are USPS-themed, with the campaigns directing users to bogus package tracking pages that prompt users to enter their personal and credit/debit card information, as evidenced by security researcher @JCyberSec_ on X (formerly Twitter) in early September 2022.""Do you think the deploying actor knows all the kits have a hidden backdoor sending the logs to another place?,"" the researcher further noted.If anything, the development represents commodity threat actors' ongoing attempts to exploit cloud environments for smishing campaigns. In April 2023, Permiso revealed an activity cluster that took advantage of previously exposed AWS access keys to infiltrate AWS servers and send SMS messages using SNS.The findings also follow the discovery of a new dropper codenamed TicTacToe that's likely sold as a service to threat actors and has been observed being used to propagate a wide variety of information stealers and remote access trojans (RATs) targeting Windows users throughout 2023.Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, which shed light on the malware, said it's deployed by means of a four-stage infection chain that starts with an ISO file embedded within email messages.Another relevant example of threat actors continuously innovating their tactics concerns the use of advertising networks to stage effective spam campaigns and deploy malware such as DarkGate.""The threat actor proxied links through an advertising network to evade detection and capture analytics about their victims,"" HP Wolf Security said. ""The campaigns were initiated through malicious PDF attachments posing as OneDrive error messages, leading to the malware.""The infosec arm of the PC maker also highlighted the misuse of legitimate platforms like Discord to stage and distribute malware, a trend that has become increasingly common in recent years, prompting the company to switch to temporary file links by the end of last year.""Discord is known for its robust and reliable infrastructure, and it is widely trusted,"" Intel 471 said. ""Organizations often allowlist Discord, meaning that links and connections to it are not restricted. This makes its popularity among threat actors unsurprising given its reputation and widespread use.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

This could cause the process to crash. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.54 and earlier.A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int(""text""), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are not affected). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.A flaw was found in libdnf's signature verification functionality in versions before 0.60.1. This flaw allows an attacker to achieve code execution if they can alter the header information of an RPM package and then trick a user or system into installing it. The highest risk of this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the ATI VGA device emulation of QEMU. This flaw occurs in the ati_2d_blt() routine while handling MMIO write operations when the guest provides invalid values for the destination display parameters. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the Linux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. It is possible for an SSH server to change the login process in its favor due to a non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code. This attack can bypass additional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.A denial of service vulnerability exists in mbed TLS 3.0.0 and earlier in the mbedtls_pkcs12_derivation function when an input password's length is 0.In Mbed TLS before 3.1.0, psa_aead_generate_nonce allows policy bypass or oracle-based decryption when the output buffer is at memory locations accessible to an untrusted application.There is a flaw in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c of the netfilter subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to cause an out-of-bounds write issue.There is a vulnerability in the way the state file is created in logrotate. The state file is used to prevent parallel executions of multiple instances of logrotate by acquiring and releasing a file lock. When the state file does not exist, it is created with world-readable permission, allowing an unprivileged user to lock the state file, stopping any rotation. This flaw affects logrotate versions before 3.20.0.3.2.11 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416A use-after-free flaw was found in nf_tables cross-table in the net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c function in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local, privileged attacker to cause a use-after-free problem at the time of table deletion, possibly leading to local privilege escalation.Requests forwarded by ReverseProxy include raw query parameters from the inbound request, including unparsable parameters rejected by net/http. This could permit query parameter smuggling when a Go proxy forwards a parameter with an unparsable value. Once the fix is applied, ReverseProxy sanitizes the query parameters in the forwarded query when the outbound request's Form field is set after the ReverseProxy. Director function returns, indicating that the proxy has parsed the query parameters. Proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to forward the original query parameters unchanged.Users may have access to secure endpoints in the control plane network. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can modify Node objects and send proxy requests to them. Kubernetes supports node proxying, which allows clients of kube-apiserver to access endpoints of a Kubelet to establish connections to Pods, retrieve container logs, and more. While Kubernetes already validates the proxying address for Nodes, a bug in kube-apiserver made it possible to bypass this validation. Bypassing this validation could allow authenticated requests destined for Nodes to to the API server's private network.A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Samba within the GSSAPI unwrap_des() and unwrap_des3() routines of Heimdal. The DES and Triple-DES decryption routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library allow a length-limited write buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when presented with a maliciously small packet. This flaw allows a remote user to send specially crafted malicious data to the application, possibly resulting in a denial-of-service attack.A vulnerability was found in the Libksba library due to an integer overflow within the CRL parser. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely for code execution on the target system by passing specially crafted data to the application.A vulnerability was found in systemd. This security flaw can cause a local information leak due to systemd-coredump not respecting the fs.suid_dumpable kernel setting.A potential memory leak issue was discovered in SDL2 in GLES_CreateTexture() function in SDL_render_gles.c. The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack. The vulnerability affects SDL2 v2.0.4 and above. SDL-1.x are not affected.3.2.18 DOUBLE FREE CWE-415A double-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP device driver functionality in how a user registers the device when the register_netdevice function fails (NETDEV_REGISTER notifier). This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.3.2.19 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787A vulnerability was found in PHP where setting the environment variable PHP_CLI_SERVER_WORKERS to a large value leads to a heap buffer overflow.A flaw was found in the c-ares package. The ares_set_sortlist is missing checks for the validity of the input string, which allows a possible arbitrary length stack overflow. This issue may cause a denial of service or a limited impact on confidentiality and integrity.containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers.Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a mechanism to allow defining attributes for paths. These attributes can be defined by adding a .gitattributes file to the repository, which contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of attributes for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be triggered via a crafted .gitattributes file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from the index. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working tree, the index or both. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes, which may result in remote code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A specially crafted Lua script executing in Redis can trigger a heap overflow in the cjson library, and result with heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6, and affects only authenticated and authorized users. The problem is fixed in versions 7.0.12, 6.2.13, and 6.0.20.3.2.24 INCORRECT COMPARISON CWE-697A logic issue was addressed with improved state management. This issue is fixed in Security Update 2022-003 Catalina, macOS Monterey 12.3, macOS Big Sur 11.6.5. An application may be able to gain elevated privileges.3.2.25 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787There is a possible overflow in handle_image() when shim tries to load and execute crafted EFI executables; The handle_image() function takes into account the SizeOfRawData field from each section to be loaded. An attacker can leverage this to perform out-of-bound writes to memory. Arbitrary code execution is not discarded in such scenario.3.2.26 DOUBLE FREE CWE-415A double free was found in the Regexp compiler in Ruby 3.x before 3.0.4 and 3.1.x before 3.1.2. If a victim attempts to create a Regexp from untrusted user input, an attacker may be able to write to unexpected memory locations.3.2.27 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125There is a buffer over read in Ruby before 2.6.10, 2.7.x before 2.7.6, 3.x before 3.0.4, and 3.1.x before 3.1.2. It occurs in string-to-float conversion, including Kernel#Float and String#to_f.An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary files inside the directories of connecting peers. The server chooses which files or directories are sent to the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync server (or man-in-the-middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where runc exec --cap created processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes runc exec --cap behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via --caparguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, runc spec is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (config.json) file.Git is a distributed revision control system. Git prior to versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5, is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all platforms. An unsuspecting user could still be affected by the issue reported in CVE-2022-24765, for example when navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is owned by them, but where an attacker could create a git repository. Versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5 contain a patch for this issue. The simplest way to avoid being affected by the exploit described in the example is to avoid running git as root (or an administrator in Windows), and if needed to reduce its use to a minimum. While a generic workaround is not possible, a system could be hardened from the exploit described in the example by removing any such repository if it exists already and creating one as root to block any future attacks.3.2.31 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787In GNOME Epiphany before 41.4 and 42.x before 42.2, an HTML document can trigger a client buffer overflow (in ephy_string_shorten in the UI process) via a long page title. The issue occurs because the number of bytes for a UTF-8 ellipsis character is not properly considered.Improper exposure of client IP addresses in net/http before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 can be triggered by calling httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP with a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, which causes ReverseProxy to set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header.GnuPG through 2.3.6, in unusual situations where an attacker possesses any secret-key information from a victim's keyring and other constraints (e.g., use of GPGME) are met, allows signature forgery via injection into the status line.An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.9. A type confusion bug in nft_set_elem_init (leading to a buffer overflow) could be used by a local attacker to escalate privileges, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-32250. (The attacker can obtain root access, but must start with an unprivileged user namespace to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN access.) This can be fixed in nft_setelem_parse_data in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c.Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users can use string matching commands (like SCAN or KEYS) with a specially crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis, causing it to hang and consume 100% CPU time. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.0.18, 6.2.11, 7.0.9.In libarchive before 3.6.2, the software does not check for an error after calling calloc function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: the discoverer cites this CWE-476 remark but third parties dispute the code-execution impact: ""In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or reading memory is possible, which may lead to code execution.""Inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling') vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards requests to. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server Apache HTTP Server 2.4 version 2.4.54 and prior versions.Prior to Apache HTTP Server 2.4.55, a malicious backend can cause the response headers to be truncated early, resulting in some headers being incorporated into the response body. If the later headers have any security purpose, they will not be interpreted by the client.The Keccak XKCP SHA-3 reference implementation before fdc6fef has an integer overflow and resultant buffer overflow that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or eliminate expected cryptographic properties. This occurs in the sponge function interface.In lighttpd 1.4.65, mod_wstunnel does not initialize a handler function pointer if an invalid HTTP request (websocket handshake) is received. It leads to null pointer dereference which crashes the server. It could be used by an external attacker to cause denial-of-service condition.An integer overflow in the RFC3164 parser in One Identity syslog-ng 3.0 through 3.37 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via crafted syslog input that is mishandled by the tcp or network function. syslog-ng Premium Edition 7.0.30 and syslog-ng Store Box 6.10.0 are also affected.An issue was discovered the x86 KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.18.17. Unprivileged guest users can compromise the guest kernel because TLB flush operations are mishandled in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations.3.2.43 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system. git shell is a restricted login shell that can be used to implement Git's push/pull functionality via SSH. In versions prior to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4, the function that splits the command arguments into an array improperly uses an int to represent the number of entries in the array, allowing a malicious actor to intentionally overflow the return value, leading to arbitrary heap writes. Because the resulting array is then passed to execv(), it is possible to leverage this attack to gain remote code execution on a victim machine. Note that a victim must first allow access to git shell as a login shell in order to be vulnerable to this attack. This problem is patched in versions 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4 and users are advised to upgrade to the latest version. Disabling git shell access via remote logins is a viable short-term workaround.An integer overflow vulnerability in pcre2test before 10.41 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impacts via negative input.A resource leak in gw_backend.c in lighttpd 1.4.56 through 1.4.66 could lead to a denial of service (connection-slot exhaustion) after a large amount of anomalous TCP behavior by clients. It is related to RDHUP mishandling in certain HTTP/1.1 chunked situations. Use of mod_fastcgi is, for example, affected. This is fixed in 1.4.67.Programs which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may be vulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input, but in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than that are rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting HTTP/2 requests. HTTP/2 server connections contain a cache of HTTP header keys sent by the client. While the total number of entries in this cache is capped, an attacker sending very large keys can cause the server to allocate approximately 64 MiB per open connection.A maliciously crafted HTTP/2 stream could cause excessive CPU consumption in the HPACK decoder, sufficient to cause a denial of service from a small number of small requests.In freeradius, when an EAP-SIM supplicant sends an unknown SIM option, the server will try to look that option up in the internal dictionaries. This lookup will fail, but the SIM code will not check for that failure. Instead, it will dereference a NULL pointer, and cause the server to crash.A flaw was found in freeradius. A malicious RADIUS client or home server can send a malformed binary attribute which can cause the server to crash.In PostgreSQL, a modified, unauthenticated server can send an unterminated string during the establishment of Kerberos transport encryption. In certain conditions a server can cause a libpq client to over-read and report an error message containing uninitialized bytes.Git is distributed revision control system. git log can display commits in an arbitrary format using its --format specifiers. This functionality is also exposed to git archive via the export-subst gitattribute. When processing the padding operators, there is a integer overflow in pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit() where a size_t is stored improperly as an int, and then added as an offset to a memcpy(). This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., git log --format=...). It may also be triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes, which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should disable git archive in untrusted repositories. If you expose git archive via git daemon, disable it by running git config --global daemon.uploadArch false.Python 3.9.x before 3.9.16 and 3.10.x before 3.10.9 on Linux allows local privilege escalation in a non-default configuration. The Python multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege escalation that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9.3.2.54 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787NASM v2.16 was discovered to contain a heap buffer overflow in the component quote_for_pmake() asm/nasm.c:856An issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.The fix for CVE-2022-3437 included changing memcmp to be constant time and a workaround for a compiler bug by adding ""!= 0"" comparisons to the result of memcmp. When these patches were backported to the heimdal-7.7.1 and heimdal-7.8.0 branches (and possibly other branches) a logic inversion sneaked in causing the validation of message integrity codes in gssapi/arcfour to be inverted.3.2.57 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. In drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c, a use-after-free can occur is there is a disconnect after an open, because of the lack of a wait_event.An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.2 and 3.x before 3.3.0. An adversary with access to precise enough information about memory accesses (typically, an untrusted operating system attacking a secure enclave) can recover an RSA private key after observing the victim performing a single private-key operation, if the window size (MBEDTLS_MPI_WINDOW_SIZE) used for the exponentiation is 3 or smaller.3.2.59 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.2 and 3.x before 3.3.0. There is a potential heap-based buffer overflow and heap-based buffer over-read in DTLS if MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CONNECTION_ID is enabled and MBEDTLS_SSL_CID_IN_LEN_MAX > 2 * MBEDTLS_SSL_CID_OUT_LEN_MAX.Libksba before 1.6.3 is prone to an integer overflow vulnerability in the CRL signature parser.3.2.61 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte, out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump. Exploitation to change the flow of control has not been demonstrated. The issue occurs in from_header in list.c via a V7 archive in which mtime has approximately 11 whitespace characters.3.2.62 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416libavcodec/pthread_frame.c in FFmpeg before 5.1.2, as used in VLC and other products, leaves stale hwaccel state in worker threads, which allows attackers to trigger a use-after-free and execute arbitrary code in some circumstances (e.g., hardware re-initialization upon a mid-video SPS change when Direct3D11 is used).3.2.63 IMPROPER LOCKING CWE-667A deadlock flaw was found in the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to potentially crash the system.3.2.64 OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787A vulnerability in the lsi53c895a device affects the latest version of qemu. A DMA-MMIO reentrancy problem may lead to memory corruption bugs like stack overflow or use-after-free.A timing side channel in the handling of RSA ClientKeyExchange messages was discovered in GnuTLS. This side channel can be sufficient to recover the key encrypted in the RSA ciphertext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption the attacker would need to send a large amount of specially crafted messages to the vulnerable server. By recovering the secret from the ClientKeyExchange message, the attacker would be able to decrypt the application data exchanged over that connection.3.2.66 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This issue occurs due to a dangling pointer in DeepCopyPointerClasses that can be exploited by ProcXkbSetDeviceInfo() and ProcXkbGetDeviceInfo() to read and write into freed memory. This can lead to local privilege elevation on systems where the X server runs privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions.In PHP 8.0.X before 8.0.28, 8.1.X before 8.1.16 and 8.2.X before 8.2.3, password_verify() function may accept some invalid Blowfish hashes as valid. If such invalid hash ever ends up in the password database, it may lead to an application allowing any password for this entry as valid.In PHP 8.0.X before 8.0.28, 8.1.X before 8.1.16 and 8.2.X before 8.2.3, core path resolution function allocate buffer one byte too small. When resolving paths with lengths close to system MAXPATHLEN setting, this may lead to the byte after the allocated buffer being overwritten with NUL value, which might lead to unauthorized data access or modification.3.2.69 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416A use-after-free flaw was found in qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c in the Linux kernel due to a race problem. This flaw leads to a denial-of-service issue. If patch ebda44da44f6 (""net: sched: fix race condition in qdisc_graft()"") not applied yet, then kernel could be affected.In PHP 8.0.X before 8.0.28, 8.1.X before 8.1.16 and 8.2.X before 8.2.3, excessive number of parts in HTTP form upload can cause high resource consumption and excessive number of log entries. This can cause denial of service on the affected server by exhausting CPU resources or disk space.A hash collision flaw was found in the IPv6 connection lookup table in the Linux kernel's IPv6 functionality when a user makes a new kind of SYN flood attack. A user located in the local network or with a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6 connections up to 95%.3.2.72 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125A slab-out-of-bounds read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux kernel. This issue could occur when assoc_info->req_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading to a denial of service.3.2.73 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416A flaw was found in X.Org Server Overlay Window. A use after free may lead to local privilege escalation. If a client explicitly destroys the compositor overlay window (aka COW), the Xserver would leave a dangling pointer to that window in the CompScreen structure, which will trigger a use after free later.3.2.74 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416A use-after-free flaw was found in btrfs_search_slot in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in btrfs in the Linux kernel.3.2.75 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416A use-after-free flaw in the Linux kernel Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card) Ethernet driver was found.

Wyze investigating 'security issue' amid ongoing outage,"Wyze Labs is investigating a security issue while experiencing a service outage that has been causing connectivity issues since this morning.In an incident report posted at 6:31 AM PT, the company blamed today's camera and login issues on an AWS connectivity problem.""We are aware of an issue with our AWS partner which has impacted device connection and caused login difficulties. We are taking steps to mitigate the problem on our end as we work with AWS to resolve the issue,"" the company said.Hours later, Wyze said it's still monitoring device connection recovery after working all day to get all cameras back online and advised customers still experiencing issues to reboot or power-cycle impacted devices.However, it also added that the ""Events"" tab in the Wyze app will be temporarily disabled while investigating what it describes as a ""possible security issue.""""As you know we had an outage this morning driven by an issue with our partner AWS,"" said Wyze CMO and cofounder Dave Crosby in a post on the company's official forum.""Cameras are starting to come back online for live viewing, but we are now restricting access to the Events tab while we investigate a possible security issue. We're so sorry and will get your cameras fully recovered as soon as possible! We will also share results of our investigation.""A Wyze spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today.Update February 17, 10:47 EST: The users who reported seeing other peoples' video feeds were actually seeing only the feeds thumbnails, according to Wyze. The company is now working on identifying all affected customers and has logged out all users who used the app on Friday.""We have now identified a security issue where some users were able to see thumbnails of cameras that were not their own in the Events tab. Fortunately, they were not able to view live streams or watch these videos, only the thumbnails were visible,"" Wyze said.""So far we’ve collected 14 reports of this happening, but we are currently identifying all affected users. These affected users will be notified asap. We will also send notification to all Wyze users explaining what happened.""As soon as we saw these reports we took down the Events tab. We then added in an extra layer of verification for each user before they could see thumbnails. To be extra safe, we are now force logging out all users who have used the Wyze app today to reset tokens.""Commentslanickel - 21 hours agoThis is why you install a local system that does not need any outside services.

Iran Warship Aiding Houthi Pirates Hacked by US,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.US reportedly launched a cyberattack against an Iranian military ship suspected of helping Houthi rebel pirates menacing shipping traffic in the Red Sea.February 16, 2024US officials claim a recent cyberattack on an Iranian military spy ship disrupted intelligence-gathering on Red Sea traffic used to aid Houthi rebels in piracy against cargo ships.Exclusive reporting by NBC said the US-waged cyberattack on the ship took place more than a week ago against the Iranian military ship MV Behshad, which according to US officials was using its reconnaissance technology to share information with Houthi Rebels in Yemen, the group behind regular attacks terrorizing Red Sea international shipping lanes. About 12% of all daily shipping traffic passes through the Red Sea, according to NBC.Long backed by Iran, the Houthi rebels claim to be targeting ships in the Red Sea in response to Israel's military operation in Gaza.Read more about:DR Global Middle East & AfricaAbout the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE
What Using Security to Regulate AI Chips Could Look Like,"News, news analysis, and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology.An exploratory research proposal is recommending regulation of AI chips and stronger governance measures to keep up with the rapid technical innovations in artificial intelligence.February 16, 2024Researchers from OpenAI, Cambridge University, Harvard University, and University of Toronto offered ""exploratory"" ideas on how to regulate AI chips and hardware, and how security policies could prevent the abuse of advanced AI.The recommendations provide ways to measure and audit the development and use of advanced AI systems and the chips that power them. Policy enforcement recommendations include limiting the performance of systems and implementing security features that can remotely disable rogue chips.""Training highly capable AI systems currently requires accumulating and orchestrating thousands of AI chips,"" the researchers wrote. ""[I]f these systems are potentially dangerous, then limiting this accumulated computing power could serve to limit the production of potentially dangerous AI systems.""Governments have largely focused on software for AI policy, and the paper is a companion piece covering the hardware side of the debate, says Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst of Insight 64.However, the industry will not welcome any security features that affect the performance of AI, he warns. Making AI safe through hardware ""is a noble aspiration, but I can't see any one of those making it. The genie is out of the lamp and good luck getting it back in,"" he says.Throttling Connections Between ClustersOne of the proposals the researchers suggest is a cap to limit the compute processing capacity available to AI models. The idea is to put security measures in place that can identify abuse of AI systems, and cutting off and limiting the use of chips.Specifically, they suggest a targeted approach of limiting the bandwidth between memory and chip clusters. The easier alternative — to cut off access to chips — wasn’t ideal as it would affect overall AI performance, the researchers wrote.The paper did not suggest ways to implement such security guardrails or how abuse of AI systems could be detected.""Determining the optimal bandwidth limit for external communication is an area that merits further research,"" the researchers wrote.Large-scale AI systems demand tremendous network bandwidth, and AI systems such as Microsoft's Eagle and Nvidia's Eos are among the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world. Ways to limit network performance do exist for devices supporting the P4 programming language, which can analyze network traffic and reconfigure routers and switches.But good luck asking chip makers to implement AI security mechanisms that could slow down chips and networks, Brookwood says.""Arm, Intel, and AMD are all busy building the fastest, meanest chips they can build to be competitive. I don't know how you can slow down,"" he says.Remote Possibilities Carry Some RiskThe researchers also suggested disabling chips remotely, which is something that Intel has built into its newest server chips. The On Demand feature is a subscription service that will allow Intel customers to turn on-chip features such as AI extensions on and off like heated seats in a Tesla.The researchers also suggested an attestation scheme where chips allow only authorized parties to access AI systems via cryptographically signed digital certificates. Firmware could provide guidelines on authorized users and applications, which could be changed with updates.While the researchers did not provide technical recommendations on how this would be done, the idea is similar to how confidential computing secures applications on chips by attesting authorized users. Intel and AMD have confidential computing on their chips, but it is still early days yet for the emerging technology.There are also risks to remotely enforcing policies. ""Remote enforcement mechanisms come with significant downsides, and may only be warranted if the expected harm from AI is extremely high,"" the researchers wrote.Brookwood agrees.""Even if you could, there are going to be bad guys who are going to pursue it. Putting artificial constraints for good guys is going to be ineffective,"" he says.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeWhat Using Security to Regulate AI Chips Could Look LikeFeb 16, 2024|3 Min ReadCISA HBOM Framework Doesn't Go Far EnoughFeb 15, 2024|3 Min ReadManaged Everything?

Alpha ransomware linked to NetWalker operation dismantled in 2021,"Security researchers analyzing the Alpha ransomware payload and modus operandi discovered overlaps with the now-defunct Netwalker ransomware operation.The Alpha ransomware operation (not to be confused with ALPHV/BlackCat) emerged in February 2023 but kept a low profile, didn't promote on hacker forums, nor did its operators carry out many attacks.This changed recently when the group launched a data leak site to list victims and publish files stolen from breached networks.At the time of writing, Alpha shows nine victims on its extortion portal, and for eight of them the threat actor has already published the stolen files.A Neterich report from January 29 says that Alpha has gradually grown more sophisticated.In the most recent version, the ransomware appends a random 8-character alphanumeric extension to encrypted files.Also, after many ransom note iterations, the latest includes instructions for victims to contact the threat actor over a messaging service.The reported ransom demand, according to Neterich, ranges between 0.272 BTC ($13,200 by today's exchange rate) and up to $100,000, likely depending on the business size of the victim.Links to NetwalkerA new report published today by Symantec's threat analysts links Alpha to the defunct Netwalker ransomware, based on tools and tactics, techniques, and procedures used in attacks.The key similarities the Symantec highlights include the following:- Both Netwalker and Alpha ransomware use a similar PowerShell-based loader to deliver their payloads.- Significant code overlaps in the payload, including the general execution flow of the main functionalities, termination of processes and services, and similarities in invoking system APIs.- Configuration similarities in the list of folders, files, and extensions to be skipped, as well as the processes and services to be killed.- Both delete themselves using a temporary batch file after the completion of the encryption process.- The payment portals for both Netwalker and Alpha contain the same message: ""For enter, please use user code.""Symantec also reports that recent Alpha attacks extensively employ living-off-the-land tools, including Taskkill, PsExec, Net.exe, and Reg.exe, for evasion. However, this is common to many ransomware gangs.The above similarities indicate a strong link between NetWalker and Alpha's developers, which could either mean a revival of NetWalker under the Alpha brand or that its code is being reused by a new threat group.Symantec notes that a new attacker could have acquired the NetWalker payload and adapted it for their ransomware operation.Although it is not currently a significant player on the ransomware scene, Alpha is regarded as an emerging threat organizations should watch out for.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

"Like Seat Belts and Airbags, 2FA Must Be Mandatory ASAP","February 16, 2024COMMENTARYOne of the few pieces of information that is truly immutable and potentially invaluable is genetic information. We can't change our genome to any large degree. Unlike biometric data, which may be stored in any number of different algorithmic or hashed structures, genetic information can be invariably reduced to simple sequences of amino acid pairs. The nightmare scenario, then, is bad actors hacking a genetic database and getting access to the biological blueprints to large numbers of people.Recently, that nightmare came true with the hack of genetic testing company 23andMe. Attackers used classic credential-stuffing techniques to illegally access 14,000 user accounts. But they didn't stop there. Because of sharing features of 23andMe that enable users to share and read data of other users who might be related, the hackers were able to extract genetic data from 6.9 million people. The attackers posted offers on the Dark Web for 1 million profiles. 23andMe did not disclose the full impact until a month after the attack.To protect users, 23andMe is prompting all users to immediately change their passwords and ensure they are unique and complex. This is good but insufficient. More important, the company is automatically enrolling existing customers into two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security. Rather than wait for the inevitable catastrophic event, every single software-as-a-service (SaaS) app should make 2FA mandatory and best practices should be moved from 2FA to MFA with a minimum of three factors available. It's now a matter of public safety and should be mandatory, just as car manufacturers must include seat belts and airbags in their vehicles.Network Effects Multiply Impacts of CompromiseMany of our accounts and SaaS applications include networked capabilities that increase exposure exponentially. In the case of 23andMe, exposed data included information from DNA Relatives profiles (5.5 million) and Family Tree profiles (1.4 million) that the 14,000 account users had shared or made accessible. This information included locations, display names, relationship labels, and DNA shared with matches, as well as birth years and locations for some users. While the market value of DNA data for hackers remains unclear, its uniqueness and irreplaceable nature raise concerns about potential misuse and targeting in the future.Replace 23andMe with Dropbox, Outlook, or Slack, and you can easily see how a relatively small number of exposed accounts can yield data for an entire organization. Access to an Outlook account might yield the names and social connections, along with interactions that could be useful for building more believable social engineering attacks.This isn't a minor threat. We are increasingly seeing savvy attackers looking for more weakly guarded applications that have considerable networked information to execute broader attacks. According to the 2023 IBM X-Force 2023 Threat Intelligence Index, 41% of successful attacks used phishing and social engineering as their primary vector. For example, the Okta session token incident looked to take advantage of weaker security on its customer support and ticketing system as a means to gather information for phishing attacks against customers. The costs of these attacks are rising and can be staggering. IBM estimates the average breach cost over $4 million and the market capitalization of Okta plummeted billions of dollars after announcing the breach.A Long Overdue Fix: Mandatory 2FA for LoginsThe 23andMe hack hammers home an obvious truth. Username and password combinations aren't only inherently insecure but essentially uninsurable and an unacceptable risk. Even assuming that a password alone provides security is foolish. In security and other certification processes, any company that fails to enable automated 2FA enrollment should be flagged as risky to provide the necessary risk information to partners, investors, customers, and government bodies.The 2FA must be mandatory and enforced as the price of entry for any SaaS application — no exceptions. Some organizations might complain that such a mandate will introduce additional friction and negatively impact user experience. But innovative application designers have largely solved these problems by building from first principles under the assumption that their users will be required to use 2FA. What's more, numerous leading organizations like GitHub have rolled out 2FA mandates, so there's no shortage of examples of how talented UX teams are handling the challenge.Curiously, the same claims of friction and inconvenience were once the staple complaint against seat belt mandates. Today, no one blinks, and seat belts are widely accepted. In that same vein, seat belts and airbags for SaaS apps will, in the end, save the world many billions of dollars in reduced losses and increased productivity.What about passkeys? Unfortunately, they're unlikely to hit critical mass in enterprise for years to come. And passkeys are even more secure when paired with MFA. The challenge, then, will be on SaaS makers to up their usability game and make 2FA and MFA even easier for everyone to use — especially more-secure factors such as biometrics, hardware keys, and authenticator apps.Genetic data is the canary in the SaaS security coal mine. As more and more of our lives and activities go online, more risk accrues to businesses and consumers alike. Building greater security into SaaS is a public good that will benefit everyone. The best and most obvious step right now is mandating 2FA as a baseline level of security.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,vulnerability reports,FALSE
CISA Warning: Akira Ransomware Exploiting Cisco ASA/FTD Vulnerability,"The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday added a now-patched security flaw impacting Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, following reports that it's being likely exploited in Akira ransomware attacks.The vulnerability in question is CVE-2020-3259 (CVSS score: 7.5), a high-severity information disclosure issue that could allow an attacker to retrieve memory contents on an affected device. It was patched by Cisco as part of updates released in May 2020.Late last month, cybersecurity firm Truesec said it found evidence suggesting that it has been weaponized by Akira ransomware actors to compromise multiple susceptible Cisco Anyconnect SSL VPN appliances over the past year.""There is no publicly available exploit code for [...] CVE-2020-3259, meaning that a threat actor, such as Akira, exploiting that vulnerability would need to buy or produce exploit code themselves, which requires deep insights into the vulnerability,"" security researcher Heresh Zaremand said.According to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, Akira is one of the 25 groups with newly established data leak sites in 2023, with the ransomware group publicly claiming nearly 200 victims. First observed in March 2023, the group is believed to share connections with the notorious Conti syndicate based on the fact that the ransom proceeds have been routed to Conti-affiliated wallet addresses.In the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, the e-crime group listed 49 victims on its data leak portal, putting it behind LockBit (275), Play (110), ALPHV/BlackCat (102), NoEscape (76), 8Base (75), and Black Basta (72).Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to remediate identified vulnerabilities by March 7, 2024, to secure their networks against potential threats.CVE-2020-3259 is far from the only flaw to be exploited for delivering ransomware. Earlier this month, Arctic Wolf Labs revealed the abuse of CVE-2023-22527 – a recently uncovered shortcoming in Atlassian Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server – to deploy C3RB3R ransomware, as well as cryptocurrency miners and remote access trojans.The development comes as the U.S. State Department announced rewards of up to $10 million for information that could lead to the identification or location of BlackCat ransomware gang key members, in addition to offering up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of its affiliates.The ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme, much like Hive, compromised over 1,000 victims globally, netting at least $300 million in illicit profits since its emergence in late 2021. It was disrupted in December 2023 following an international coordinated operation.The ransomware landscape has become a lucrative market, attracting the attention of cybercriminals looking for quick financial gain, leading to the rise of new players such as Alpha (not to be confused with ALPHV) and Wing.There are indications that Alpha could be connected to NetWalker, which shuttered in January 2021 following an international law enforcement operation. The links pertain to overlaps in the source code and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in attacks.""Alpha may be an attempt at reviving the old ransomware operation by one or more of the original NetWalker developers,"" Broadcom-owned Symantec said. ""Alternatively, the attackers behind Alpha may have acquired and modified the original NetWalker payload in order to launch their own ransomware operation.""The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), in a report published towards the end of January 2024, called for enhanced oversight into recommended practices for addressing ransomware, specifically for organizations from critical manufacturing, energy, healthcare and public health, and transportation systems sectors.",emerging threats and attack techniques,news and industry updates,FALSE
Enterprises Worry End Users Will be the Cause of Next Major Breach,"Cybersecurity In-Depth: Digging into data about the latest attacks, threats, and trends using charts and tables.Respondents in Dark Reading's Strategic Security Survey believe that the primary cause of their organization's next major data breach would involve social engineering, negligent users, and insecure remote workers.February 16, 2024The sheer volume of data breaches and cyberattacks means these incidents are now more visible than ever. Long gone are those days when affected organizations would wait till late Friday afternoons to disclose incidents in hopes of burying the news. The heightened focus is driving security professionals to rethink their enterprise security strategy and investments in tools and services.Despite deploying a wide range of security tools to address cyber threats against their organizations, the IT and security decision makers in Dark Reading's Strategic Security Survey don't seem confident in the organization's ability to withstand attacks. A high percentage believe that the processes they have implemented, such as multi-factor authentication, malware analysis capabilities and end-user security awareness training programs are effective. Sixty-three percent are confident in their ability to respond effectively to a ransomware attack.However, 55% say their organizations are more vulnerable to data breaches than a year ago because attackers have more ways to target and break into their networks, and 58% say their organizations were more concerned about ransomware than it was a year ago. And the future doesn't look any more optimistic: 78% say adversaries will target cloud service providers more in the coming year.Twenty-five percent of respondents expect that if a major breach were to happen at their organization in the next 12 months, an automated malware tool will likely be the primary cause for it.From a future breach standpoint, end users remain the biggest concern, though. Over a third (38%) believe that the primary cause of their organization's next major data breach in the coming year would be a negligent end user or end user who breaks security policy. Almost a quarter (24%) expect it will be some kind of super elusive social engineering scam, and 15% worried about the organization's heavy reliance on remote systems and homeworkers. And 10% felt end-user security awareness programs were ineffective.Policy enforcement and the complexity associated with managing a security strategy remain big challenges. A slew of issues appears to be hampering their ability to harness the full benefits of these processes and technologies. Security policy enforcement is one example. Thirty-one percent of organizations—or about the same as last year's 30%—struggled to enforce security policies at their organizations and an identical proportion were hard pressed to manage the complexity associated with modern security threats.Read more for insights from Dark Reading's Strategic Security Survey.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeEnterprises Worry End Users Will be the Cause of Next Major BreachFeb 16, 2024|2 Min Read10 Security Metrics Categories CISOs Should Present to the BoardFeb 14, 2024|6 Min ReadHow Changes in State CIO Priorities for 2024 Apply to API SecurityFeb 12, 2024|4 Min ReadWhy Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingFeb 8, 2024|5 Min Read",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
U.S. Government Disrupts Russia-Linked Botnet Engaged in Cyber Espionage,"The U.S. government on Thursday said it disrupted a botnet comprising hundreds of small office and home office (SOHO) routers in the country that was put to use by the Russia-linked APT28 actor to conceal its malicious activities.""These crimes included vast spear-phishing and similar credential harvesting campaigns against targets of intelligence interest to the Russian government, such as U.S. and foreign governments and military, security, and corporate organizations,"" the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a statement.APT28, also tracked under the monikers BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, Fighting Ursa, Forest Blizzard (formerly Strontium), FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and TA422, is assessed to be linked to Unit 26165 of Russia's Main Directorate of the General Staff (GRU). It's known to be active since at least 2007.Court documents allege that the attackers pulled off their cyber espionage campaigns by relying on MooBot, a Mirai-based botnet that has singled out routers made by Ubiquiti to co-opt them into a mesh of devices that can be modified to act as a proxy, relaying malicious traffic while shielding their actual IP addresses.The botnet, the DoJ said, allowed the threat actors to mask their true location and harvest credentials and NT LAN Manager (NTLM) v2 hashes via bespoke scripts, as well as host spear-phishing landing pages and other custom tooling for brute-forcing passwords, stealing router user passwords, and propagating the MooBot malware to other appliances.In a redacted affidavit filed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the agency said MooBot exploits vulnerable and publicly accessible Ubiquiti routers by using default credentials and implants an SSH malware that permits persistent remote access to the device.""Non-GRU cybercriminals installed the MooBot malware on Ubiquiti Edge OS routers that still used publicly known default administrator passwords,"" the DoJ explained. ""GRU hackers then used the MooBot malware to install their own bespoke scripts and files that repurposed the botnet, turning it into a global cyber espionage platform.""The APT28 actors are suspected to have found and illegally accessed compromised Ubiquiti routers by conducting public scans of the internet using a specific OpenSSH version number as a search parameter, and then using MooBot to access those routers.Spear-phishing campaigns undertaken by the hacking group have also leveraged a then-zero-day in Outlook (CVE-2023-23397) to siphon login credentials and transmit them to the routers.""In another identified campaign, APT28 actors designed a fake Yahoo! landing page to send credentials entered on the false page to a compromised Ubiquiti router to be collected by APT28 actors at their convenience,"" the FBI said.As part of its efforts to disrupt the botnet in the U.S. and prevent further crime, a series of unspecified commands have been issued to copy the stolen data and malicious files prior to deleting them and modify firewall rules to block APT28's remote access to the routers.The precise number of devices that were compromised in the U.S. has been censored, although the FBI noted that it could change. Infected Ubiquiti devices have been detected in ""almost every state,"" it added.The court-authorized operation – referred to as Dying Ember – comes merely weeks after the U.S. dismantled another state-sponsored hacking campaign originating from China that leveraged a different botnet codenamed KV-botnet to target critical infrastructure facilities.Last May, the U.S. also announced the takedown of a global network compromised by an advanced malware strain dubbed Snake wielded by hackers associated with Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), otherwise known as Turla.",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
Why We Must Democratize Cybersecurity,"With breaches making the headlines on an almost weekly basis, the cybersecurity challenges we face are becoming visible not only to large enterprises, who have built security capabilities over the years, but also to small to medium businesses and the broader public. While this is creating greater awareness among smaller businesses of the need to improve their security posture, SMBs are often left facing a gap in the market, unable to find security tooling that is both easy for them to use and which they can afford.When we consider the needs of SMBs, we need to focus both on the development of threat intelligence, which is necessary to understand and identify the threats being faced, as well as the tools used to provide protection. NTTSH has built a pedigree of over 20 years' experience in the research and curation of threat intelligence as well as the development of capabilities and products which leverage its threat intelligence to protect customers. After many years of focus on larger enterprises, NTTSH is moving to democratize cybersecurity and provide smaller businesses with the protection they require.Global Threat Intelligence CenterAll of NTTSH's efforts are underpinned by the capabilities of its Global Threat Intelligence Center (GTIC). The efforts of the GTIC go beyond those of a pure research organization by taking threat research and combining it with NTTSH proprietary detective technology to produce applied threat intelligence.The GTIC's mission is to protect clients by providing advanced threat research and security intelligence, enabling NTTSH to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats. To provide a truly unique vantage point within NTTSH's products and services, GTIC leverages proprietary intelligence capabilities and NTT's position as the operator of one of the world's top 5 tier 1 Internet backbones, providing unequaled visibility of Internet telemetry to gain an understanding of and insight into the various threat actors, exploit tools and malware – and the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by attackers. In addition to curating its own threat intelligence research, GTIC also maintains relationships with other key players in this space, including the Cyber Threat Alliance, Microsoft, CISA, and the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA).NTTSH's annual Global Threat Intelligence Report (GTIR) provides a window into the work done by GTIC, providing a synopsis of the key challenges in the security landscape facing organizations of all sizes, together with actionable insights to help organizations better adapt to the evolving threat landscape. In the Q3 update of the 2023 GTIR, a special focus was placed on key industry verticals, providing insights into the threats they face.Threat focus by sectorThe healthcare sector faces a unique set of challenges, not only due to the high value of the information owned by healthcare providers but also as a result of steep growth in the adoption of technology in healthcare in a context where many providers, especially smaller ones, lack awareness of cybersecurity and also don't have the resources to deploy and maintain the kinds of controls enjoyed by large enterprises. Ransomware is still proving particularly problematic. Healthcare ransomware breaches are proving to be particularly concentrated across a few geographies, with the USA, Australia, and the UK accounting for close to 80% of these breaches.|Figure 1: Ransomware victim locations in the Healthcare sector.A similar geographic trend is visible in the telecommunications sector, where the USA, UK, and Australia account for roughly 52% of ransomware attacks, while in education, the USA, UK, and Canada account for approximately 83%.Across all of the focus sectors, Lockbit 3.0 remains the most prolific ransomware threat actor. Some ransomware actors are, however, focusing on specific sectors, such as the Bl00dy ransomware gang, which specifically targets education.|Figure 2: Top ransomware actors in the telecommunications sectorSecurity Challenges of SaaSA recent area of focus for GTIC has been the way in which the rapidly accelerating adoption of SaaS is presenting its own set of challenges. SaaS is rapidly becoming an integral part of the day-to-day operations of both small and large businesses, with annual growth expected to continue at a rate of close to 20% through 2027. In this context, it is important to note that 99% of cloud security breaches are expected to be the customer's fault, according to Gartner.The shared responsibility model for cloud services has been something that larger enterprises have been familiar with for some time already. Smaller organizations are, however, still coming to grips with this model. In respect of SaaS, this means that while the cloud provider is responsible for the application, SMBs are still adapting to the fact that they retain responsibility for their data and, crucially, manage their accounts and identities. Threat actors are, as a result, focusing on ways to compromise identities, especially using techniques such as credential stuffing and phishing.Facing up to the Challenges of Hybrid ITWhile SMBs were previously able to rely on antivirus software and firewalls to protect the technology assets on their premises, most have now moved into the world of hybrid IT as they increasingly rely on cloud-delivered services. While the security controls provided by most cloud services are good, SMBs face a variety of challenges in using the security functionality that is available to them.As the attack surface of even smaller companies expands, the number of sources of security alerting grows. That is not the only challenge: threat actors will often not confine their activities to one part of your technology estate. They may start in one area, for instance, by compromising one or more endpoints (such as laptops) and then use the information they gather (such as credentials) to move laterally, for instance, to compromise a SaaS application. While large enterprises have spent the last 10 years or more building dedicated SecOps teams and intricate security toolchains, SMBs lack the resources for this kind of investment.Democratizing Security Operations with XDRWhat SMBs need is the ability to bring alerting from all of their IT infrastructure and applications into a single tool, which can analyze all of an organization's telemetry, apply threat intelligence, and then provide a simple interface that acts as a single pane of glass for managing alerting, performing investigations and responding to threats. This is where XDR provides a solution that combines the key components of a traditional SecOps toolchain in a single cloud-hosted application, which can be delivered affordably. This is the second key area where NTTSH has turned its focus towards SMBs by focusing the development of its Samurai XDR product on the needs and budgets of SMBs while still delivering the functionality that large enterprises have become accustomed to. While GTIC's research provides the intelligence needed to understand and detect the threats facing modern organizations, Samurai XDR makes GTIC's work accessible and actionable even for organizations that lack dedicated SecOps resources. It is crucial to remember that while threat intelligence is essential to be able to detect threats, every organization needs tools in order to apply it.A brief journey through Samurai XDRFrom the start, Samurai XDR is designed to be easy to use and, most importantly, to be accessible to all IT staff, not only to security analysts. The starting point of all workflows in Samurai XDR is the alerts dashboard. This is where the system presents security alerts which have been prioritized based on severity and confidence.|Figure 3: Samurai XDR Alerts DashboardThe alerts dashboard brings together alerts from all of the technologies used by the organization into a single prioritized view, with a focus on providing an intuitive interface that can be used by most IT staff, not only by specialist security analysts.Once the user has decided that an alert warrants further investigation, the Investigations view provides a similarly simple and intuitive interface for managing the lifecycle of an investigation of a potential security incident.Once events and alerts are processed, they are stored in Samurai XDR's data lake. The data lake provides the ability for users to query and analyze all of the events ingested into Samurai XDR, going back up to one full year. This makes it possible to interrogate a full year's historical data for purposes such as threat hunting - allowing Samurai XDR users to perform detailed analyses of historical events for any signs of threats that may have been dwelling for longer periods of time. Querying the events in the data lake is made possible by Samurai XDR's Advanced Query function, which allows users to search the data lake both graphically and using Microsoft's Kusto Query Language (KQL).IntegrationsIntegrations provide the mechanism to ingest telemetry (such as logs) from your IT infrastructure and applications into Samurai XDR. NTTSH has focused on bringing together the right mix of capabilities to ingest telemetry from both on-premises infrastructure and cloud services, mirroring the kind of hybrid IT environment that has become typical for even most SMBs today. Some examples of integrations currently available include:- Cloud: Azure Management Plane and Microsoft 365 (coming soon), Google Workspace (coming soon)- Endpoint Detection and Response: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, VMWare Carbon Black and Crowdstrike Falcon Insight- Next-Generation Firewalls: Cisco Secure Firewall (ASA and Firepower Threat Defense), Fortinet Fortigate, and Palo Alto Networks NGFW.Over the coming months, NTTSH will be busy adding more integrations, including but not limited to Meraki, Bitdefender, Sophos, Zoom, MalwareBytes, OneLogin, OKTA, Zscaler, AWS, and many more!Making it EasyA key area of focus for NTTSH in the development of Samurai XDR has been that of making it easy to use and easy to afford. For example, the configuration of integrations is supported by simple ""point and click"" workflows. For infrastructure that provides logs via syslog, all that is needed is to point the log source at Samurai XDR's secure syslog collector, and Samurai XDR will do the work of detecting the kind of device that is sending logs. Naturally, it's the same for cloud integrations. Samurai XDR keeps the steps to a minimum and guides the user through interactive steps and access to knowledge-base articles.Samurai XDR also follows a simple pricing model - based solely on the number of endpoints that the customer has, removing the need to try to estimate the data volumes of the telemetry that will be ingested into the platform. Standard pricing for 50 endpoints or more is only $3.33 per endpoint per month, and for smaller customers, there is a Starter Pack for up to 25 endpoints, which is priced at $750 for a year.To make it easy to try out Samurai XDR, NTTSH is providing all new customers with a free 30-day trial, making it possible to experience all of its functionality without any commitments, giving even the smallest SMBs a risk-free route to building an advanced SecOps capability.",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
"Extradited Zeus, IcedID malware kingpin pleads guilty","Zeus, IcedID malware kingpin faces 40 years in slammerNearly a decade on the FBI’s Cyber Most Wanted List after getting banks to empty vics' accountsA Ukrainian cybercrime kingpin who ran some of the most pervasive malware operations faces 40 years in prison after spending nearly a decade on the FBI's Cyber Most Wanted List.Vyacheslav Igorevich Penchukov, 37, pleaded guilty this week in the US to two charges related to his leadership role in both the Zeus and IcedID malware operations that netted millions of dollars in the process.Penchukov's plea will be seen as the latest big win for US law enforcement in its continued fight against cybercrime and those that enable it.However, authorities took their time getting him in 'cuffs. Penchukov first became involved in the Zeus banking trojan as early as May 2009 but was only arrested over a decade later in Geneva, Switzerland in 2022.Zeus' primary goals were to recruit machines into its botnet and to act as a banking trojan, stealing various information used for financial fraud, such as bank account information, passwords, and PINs.""Penchukov and his co-conspirators then falsely represented to banks that they were employees of the victims and authorized to make transfers of funds from the victims' bank accounts, causing the banks to make unauthorized transfers of funds from the victims' accounts, resulting in millions of dollars in losses to the victims,"" said the Department of Justice on Thursday.""The enterprise used residents of the United States and elsewhere as 'money mules to receive wired funds from victims' bank accounts into their own bank accounts, who then withdrew and wired funds overseas to accounts controlled by Penchukov's co-conspirators.""The FBI et al dismantled Zeus in 2014 after previously claiming that one of its variants, Gameover Zeus, had infected up to 1 million PCs globally, causing in excess of $100 million in losses.Like many other major malware strains that have come and gone, Zeus also had various different versions and iterations developed based on its source code.The SpyEye RAT, for example, was developed as a successor to Zeus and was armed with a number of additional features such as keylogging and card stealer capabilities, all with a view to facilitating financial fraud. The US nabbed two of its leaders back in 2016 who are now eight years deep into a combined 24-year sentence.Also known as Vyacheslav Igoravich Andreev, and sometimes just 'Tank', Penchukov's role in the Zeus operation landed him a spot on the FBI's Cyber Most Wanted List, an accolade that would do very little to stop him from carrying on as normal.Undeterred by the 2014 takedown of Zeus, SpyEye's head honchos, and of course being firmly in the FBI's crosshairs, Penchukov returned to cybercrime in 2018, taking up a leadership role in the IcedID operation.It's perhaps no surprise Penchukov found his way to IcedID in 2018. At the time, like Zeus, it was primarily a banking malware and was the new thing on the scene, potentially representing an exciting albeit not entirely unfamiliar project to sink his teeth into.More recently, and perhaps why it became such a hot target for US authorities, IcedID became a precursor to ransomware and was linked to a 2020 attack on the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVM).The facility incurred losses upwards of $30 million, the DoJ said, and jeopardized critical patient services for two weeks after, creating a risk to life.""Malware like IcedID bleeds billions from the American economy and puts our critical infrastructure and national security at risk,"" said US attorney Michael Easley for the eastern district of North Carolina.- BlackCat plays with malvertising traps to lure corporate victims- Last of the Gozi 3 sentenced over Windows info-stealing malware ops- Suspected Gozi malware gang 'CIO' extradited to US on fraud, hacking charges- Fortinet's week to forget: Critical vulns, disclosure screw-ups, and that toothbrush DDoS attack claim""The Justice Department and FBI Cyber Squad won't stand by and watch it happen, and won't quit coming for the world's most wanted cybercriminals, no matter where they are in the world. This operation removed a key player from one of the world's most notorious cybercriminal rings. Extradition is real. Anyone who infects American computers had better be prepared to answer to an American judge.""Penchukov was eventually arrested in 2022 and extradited to the US a year later. This week, he admitted one count of conspiracy to commit a racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (RICO) act offense relating to Zeus, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in relation to IcedID.Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.

North Korean hackers now launder stolen crypto via YoMix tumbler,"The North Korean hacker collective Lazarus, infamous for having carried out numerous large-scale cryptocurrency heists over the years, has switched to using YoMix bitcoin mixer to launder stolen proceeds.According to a report from blockchain analysis company Chainalysis, Lazarus has adapted its laundering process after governments sanctioned multiple bitcoin mixing services the threat actor used.The firm says that YoMix has seen a massive influx of funds throughout 2023, that are not attributed to popularity increase but rather Lazarus activity.Lazarus laundering opsCrypto-theft is just one aspect Lazarus operations, albeit a very important part of its activities, which is believed to fund not only the group's operations but also North Korea's weapons development program.Some of the largest cryptocurrency theft operations Lazarus conducted in recent years include the March 2022 Ronin Network (Axie Infinity) hack that yielded $625 million, the Harmony Horizon hack in June 2022 that resulted in losses of $100 million, and the July 2023 Alphapo heist from where the hackers pocketed $60 million worth of crypto.From January 2017 until December 2023, North Korean hacking groups, including Lazarus, Kimsuky, and Andariel, have stolen an estimated $3 billion in crypto, according to a report from Recorded Future.The money went through various coin mixing services that don't abide by anti-laundering regulations and accept deposits even from wallets flagged for suspicious activity.The mixers bounce the assets through an obfuscated network of cryptocurrency holders and receive them in new wallet addresses that cannot be traced to the original attacks.Over the years, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified and sanctioned some of the platforms Lazarus used for laundering their proceeds, including Blender, Tornado Cash, and Sinbad.However, every time a platform was sanctioned and isolated from the crypto space, Lazarus moved to a new one. Chainalysis says YoMix is the latest service used by the North Korean threat actor.2023 laundering trendsChainalysis reports that YoMix saw a massive growth of funds in the second quarter of 2023, sustained until the end of the year, which is mostly attributed to money laundering.""Based on Chainalysis data, roughly one-third of all YoMix inflows have come from wallets associated with crypto hacks,"" reads the report.Chainalysis also says that last year it noticed a trend concerning the concentration of money laundering activities at a few fiat off-ramping services, with 71.7% of all illicit funds directed to just five services.However, at the deposit address level, money laundering became less concentrated, suggesting that criminals are diversifying their activities to avoid detection and the freezing of assets by law enforcement and compliance teams.Other highlights from the report include:- Flagged crypto wallet addresses sent $22.2 billion to services in 2023, a decrease from $31.5 billion in 2022.- 109 exchange deposit addresses received over $10 million worth of illicit cryptocurrency each in 2023, collectively receiving $3.4 billion in illicit cryptocurrency.- Last year, the funds sent to mixers from flagged addresses was 504.3 million, down 50% from $1 billion in 2022.- Cross-chain bridge utilization has shown significant growth in 2023, with $743.8 million in crypto received, compared to $312.2 million in 2022.BleepingComputer has contacted YoMix with a request for a comment about the service being used by North Korean hackers to laundering illegal funds but we are yet to receive a response.CommentsThomasMann - 1 day ago""The mixers bounce the assets through an obfuscated network of cryptocurrency holders and receive them in new wallet addresses that cannot be traced to the original attacks.""Could you explain that a little?

"Quest Diagnostics pays $5M for dumping patient data, waste","Quest Diagnostics pays $5M after mixing patient medical data with hazardous wasteWill cough up less than two days of annual profit in settlement – and California calls this a winQuest Diagnostics has agreed to pay almost $5 million to settle allegations it illegally dumped protected health information – and hazardous waste – at its facilities across California.This sum won't hurt at all for the corporation, one of the largest clinical medical lab networks in the US. In all, Quest is being charged slightly less than two days of its $994 million annual profit in 2023 – hardly a serious disincentive.Under the settlement [PDF], Quest will pay $3,999,500 to ten California counties (Alameda, Los Angeles, Monterey, Orange, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Joaquin, San Mateo, Ventura, and Yolo), plus give $300,000 to environmental projects and an additional $700,000 to foot attorneys' fees and other costs. In exchange, it admits no guilt over the matter.It also agreed to hire an independent environmental auditor to review waste-disposal practices at its facilities, and improve processes for handling, storage, and disposal of medical and hazardous waste – as well as personal health information – at four laboratories and more than 600 patient service centers in California.Asked about the California settlement, Quest Diagnostics spokesperson Denny Moynihan told The Register on Thursday:Quest takes patient privacy and the protection of the environment very seriously and has made significant investments to implement industry best practices to ensure hazardous waste, medical waste, and confidential patient information are disposed of properly. These include investing in technologies for treatment of biological waste, secured destruction of patient information, programs to maximize recycling efforts and minimize waste-to-landfill disposal, waste-to-energy recovery of non-recyclable wastes, and enhanced waste audit and inspection measures to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws.""Through our meticulous waste audits, it came to light that Quest Diagnostics may have encountered challenges in properly managing confidential patient data, medical waste, and hazardous materials,"" San Joaquin County district attorney Ron Freitas gushed.""Our initial inquiry in San Joaquin County prompted us to engage with the attorney general's office and other relevant parties.""In total, the district attorneys' offices said they conducted more than 30 inspections of Quest labs and patient centers across California.During those inspections, authorities dug through Quest's compactors and dumpsters, and said they found hundreds of containers of chemicals, as well as bleach, reagents, batteries, electronic waste, unredacted medical information, medical waste such as used specimen containers for blood and urine, and hazardous waste such as used batteries, solvents, and flammable liquids.- Romanian hospital ransomware crisis attributed to third-party breach- Ignore Uncle Sam's 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your peril- After injecting cancer hospital with ransomware, crims threaten to swat patients- 'Scandal-plagued' data broker tracked visits to '600 Planned Parenthood locations'This waste and data disposal broke hazardous waste law, California's Medical Waste Management Act, unfair competition law, and civil laws prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of personal health information, prosecutors argued in their court submissions [PDF].While improperly dumping hazardous waste can have terrible human health and environmental consequences, leaving people's personal records in places where identity thieves can pilfer them – even if they have to wade through bio-waste to get it – isn't particularly ideal, either.Monterey County district attorney Jeannine Pacioni commented optimistically: ""This settlement will help ensure that patients' personally identifiable and private health information is protected and will protect worker safety and human health by ensuring that hazardous and medical wastes are properly managed and disposed of."" ®",news and industry updates,regulatory changes and compliance,FALSE

RustDoor macOS Backdoor Targets Cryptocurrency Firms with Fake Job Offers,"Multiple companies operating in the cryptocurrency sector are the target of an ongoing malware campaign that involves a newly discovered Apple macOS backdoor codenamed RustDoor.RustDoor was first documented by Bitdefender last week, describing it as a Rust-based malware capable of harvesting and uploading files, as well as gathering information about the infected machines. It's distributed by masquerading itself as a Visual Studio update.While prior evidence uncovered at least three different variants of the backdoor, the exact initial propagation mechanism remained unknown.That said, the Romanian cybersecurity firm subsequently told The Hacker News that the malware was used as part of a targeted attack rather than a shotgun distribution campaign, noting that it found additional artifacts that are responsible for downloading and executing RustDoor.""Some of these first stage downloaders claim to be PDF files with job offerings, but in reality, are scripts that download and execute the malware while also downloading and opening an innocuous PDF file that bills itself as a confidentiality agreement,"" Bogdan Botezatu, director of threat research and reporting at Bitdefender, said.Since then, three more malicious samples that act as first-stage payloads have come to light, each of them purporting to be a job offering. These ZIP archives predate the earlier RustDoor binaries by nearly a month.The new component of the attack chain – i.e., the archive files (""Jobinfo.app.zip"" or ""Jobinfo.zip"") – contains a basic shell script that's responsible for fetching the implant from a website named turkishfurniture[.]blog. It's also engineered to preview a harmless decoy PDF file (""job.pdf"") hosted on the same site as a distraction.Bitdefender said it also detected four new Golang-based binaries that communicate with an actor-controlled domain (""sarkerrentacars[.]com""), whose purpose is to ""collect information about the victim's machine and its network connections using the system_profiler and networksetup utilities, which are part of the macOS operating system.In addition, the binaries are capable of extracting details about the disk via ""diskutil list"" as well as retrieving a wide list of kernel parameters and configuration values using the ""sysctl -a"" command.A closer investigation of the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure has also revealed a leaky endpoint (""/client/bots"") that makes it possible to glean details about the currently infected victims, including the timestamps when the infected host was registered and the last activity was observed.""We know there are at least three victim companies until now,"" Botezatu said.

AI models can be weaponized to hack websites on their own,"How to weaponize LLMs to auto-hijack websitesWe speak to professor who with colleagues tooled up OpenAI's GPT-4 and other neural netsAI models, the subject of ongoing safety concerns about harmful and biased output, pose a risk beyond content emission. When wedded with tools that enable automated interaction with other systems, they can act on their own as malicious agents.Computer scientists affiliated with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) have demonstrated this by weaponizing several large language models (LLMs) to compromise vulnerable websites without human guidance. Prior research suggests LLMs can be used, despite safety controls, to assist [PDF] with the creation of malware.Researchers Richard Fang, Rohan Bindu, Akul Gupta, Qiusi Zhan, and Daniel Kang went a step further and showed that LLM-powered agents – LLMs provisioned with tools for accessing APIs, automated web browsing, and feedback-based planning – can wander the web on their own and break into buggy web apps without oversight.They describe their findings in a paper titled, ""LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites.""""In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing complex tasks without prior knowledge of the vulnerability,"" the UIUC academics explain in their paper.""For example, these agents can perform complex SQL union attacks, which involve a multi-step process (38 actions) of extracting a database schema, extracting information from the database based on this schema, and performing the final hack.""In an interview with The Register, Daniel Kang, assistant professor at UIUC, emphasized that he and his co-authors did not actually let their malicious LLM agents loose on the world. The tests, he said, were done on real websites in a sandboxed environment to ensure no harm would be done and no personal information would be compromised.What we found is that GPT-4 is highly capable of these tasks. Every open source model failed, and GPT-3.5 is only marginally better than the open source models""The OpenAI Assistants API is basically used to have context, to do the function calling, and many of the other things like document retrieval that are really important for high performance. LandChain was basically used to wrap it all up. And the Playwright web browser testing framework was used to actually interact with websites.""The researchers created agents using 10 different LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B, LLaMA-2 Chat (70B), LLaMA-2 Chat (13B), LLaMA-2 Chat (7B), Mixtral-8x7B Instruct, Mistral (7B) Instruct v0.2, Nous Hermes-2 Yi (34B), and OpenChat 3.5.The first two, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, are proprietary models operated by OpenAI while the remaining eight are open source. Google's Gemini model, said to be at least as capable as GPT-4 in its latest iteration, was not available at the time.The researchers had their LLM-agents probe test websites for 15 vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery, among others. The open source models that were tested all failed.But OpenAI's GPT-4 had an overall success rate of 73.3 percent with five passes and 42.7 percent with one pass. The second place contender, OpenAI's GPT-3.5, eked out a success rate of only 6.7 percent with five passes and 2.7 percent with one pass.""That's one of the things we find very surprising,"" said Kang. ""So depending on who you talk to, this might be called scaling law or an emergent capability. What we found is that GPT-4 is highly capable of these tasks. Every open source model failed, and GPT-3.5 is only marginally better than the open source models.""- FTC asks normal folks if they'd like AI impersonation scam protection, too- Someone had to say it: Scientists propose AI apocalypse kill switches- AI won't take our jobs and it might even save the middle class- Republican senators try to outlaw rules that restrict Wall Street's use of AIOne explanation cited in the paper is that GPT-4 was better able to change its actions based on the response it got from the target website than the open source models.Kang said it's difficult to be certain why that's the case. ""Qualitatively speaking, we found that the open source models are not nearly as good at function calling as the OpenAI models.""He also cited the need to process large contexts (prompts). ""GPT-4 needs to take up to 50 actions, if you include backtracking, to accomplish some of these hacks and this requires a lot of context to actually perform,"" he explained. ""We found that the open source models were not nearly as good as GPT-4 for long contexts.""Backtracking refers to having a model revert to its previous state to try another approach when confronted with an error.The researchers conducted a cost analysis of attacking websites with LLM agents and found the software agent is far more affordable than hiring a penetration tester.""To estimate the cost of GPT-4, we performed five runs using the most capable agent (document reading and detailed prompt) and measured the total cost of the input and output tokens,"" the paper says. ""Across these 5 runs, the average cost was $4.189. With an overall success rate of 42.7 percent, this would total $9.81 per website.""Assuming that a human security analyst paid $100,000 annually, or $50 an hour, would take about 20 minutes to check a website manually, the researchers say a live pen tester would cost about $80 or eight times the cost of an LLM agent. Kang said that while these numbers are highly speculative, he expects LLMs will be incorporated into penetration testing regimes in the coming years.Asked whether cost might be a gating factor to prevent the widespread use of LLM agents for automated attacks, Kang said that may be somewhat true today but he expects costs will fall.Kang said that while traditional safety concerns related to biased and harmful training data and model output are obviously very important, the risk expands when LLMs get turned into agents.Agents are what really scares me in terms of future safety concerns""Agents are what really scares me in terms of future safety concerns,"" he said. ""Some of the vulnerabilities that we tested on, you can actually find today using automatic scanners. You can find that they exist, but you can't autonomously exploit them using the automated scanner, at least as far as I'm aware of. You aren't able to actually autonomously leverage that information.""What really worries me about future highly capable models is the ability to do autonomous hacks and self-reflection to try multiple different strategies at scale.""Asked whether he has any advice for developers, industry, and policy makers. Kang said, ""The first thing is just think very carefully about what these models could potentially be used for.""

"CISO Corner: CIO Convergence, 10 Critical Security Metrics, & Ivanti Fallout","February 17, 2024Welcome to CISO Corner, Dark Reading's weekly digest of articles tailored specifically to security operations readers and security leaders. Every week, we'll offer articles gleaned from across our news operation, The Edge, DR Technology, DR Global, and our Commentary section. We're committed to bringing you a diverse set of perspectives to support the job of operationalizing cybersecurity strategies, for leaders at organizations of all shapes and sizes.In this issue:10 Security Metrics Categories CISOs Should Present to the BoardCISO & CIO Convergence: Ready or Not, Here It ComesFCC Requires Telecom & VoIP Providers to Report PII BreachesDR Global: Middle East & Africa CISOs Plan to Increase 2024 Budgets by 10%GenAI Tools Will Permeate All Areas of the EnterpriseShould CISOs Skip Ivanti For Now?10 Security Metrics Categories CISOs Should Present to the BoardBy Ericka Chickowski, Contributing Writer, Dark ReadingBoards of directors don't care about a security program's minute technical details. They want to see how key performance indicators are tracked and used.With the US Securities and Exchange Commission's new rules around cybersecurity now in place, security teams need to bring more rigor to how they track key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs) — and how they use those metrics to advise and report to the board.""When shared with the board of directors' risk or audit committees, these key performance indicators illuminate the organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and the efficiency of cyber controls, while also helping the board of directors evaluate the adequacy of investments in technology and talent,"" according to Homaira Akbari, CEO of AKnowledge Partners, and Shamla Naidoo, head of cloud strategy for Netskope, writing in The Cyber Savvy Boardroom.Taking cues from the recommendations in the tome, Dark Reading breaks down the top security operational metrics that CISOs and cyber leaders need to be fluent with order to give the board a comprehensive report on risk levels and security performance and discusses how to create a data-backed model for determining the efficacy of an organization's program and identifying gaps in protection.CISO & CIO Convergence: Ready or Not, Here It ComesCommentary by Arthur Lozinski, CEO & Co-Founder, OomnitzaRecent shifts underscore the importance of collaboration and alignment between these two IT leaders for successful digital transformation.The CISO's stewardship of controlling digital risks is so essential to successful digital transformation that their roles increasingly are overlapping with CIO — highlighting cybersecurity's continuing trajectory from the server room to the boardroom.The two roles have been coming together for 20 years, but now CIOs are mainly tasked with procuring and harnessing technology to support business innovation — and the role is markedly less operational than it once was.Meanwhile the CISO is now a core operational stakeholder, facing compliance mandates, preventing operational disruption from data breaches, and assigning risk scores for emerging cybersecurity threats.The result? CIOs and CISOs increasingly walk in lockstep — and regardless of how the two roles evolve, the shift underscores the importance of collaboration and alignment between these two IT leaders for successful digital transformation, and beyond.More on CIO/CISO convergence: CISO & CIO Convergence: Ready or Not, Here It ComesFCC Requires Telecom & VoIP Providers to Report PII BreachesBy Tara Seals, Managing Editor, News, Dark ReadingThe Commission's breach rules for voice and wireless providers, untouched since 2017, have finally been updated for the modern age.Move over, SEC: There's a new compliance mandate in town.Starting next month, telecom and VoIP providers will have to report data breaches to the FCC, the FBI, and the Secret Service within seven days of discovery.And they will have to issue data breach notifications to customers whenever there's personally identifiable information (PII) caught up in a cyber incident.The FCC released its final rules this week, mandating that carriers and service providers be more transparent when PII is exposed. The Commission's definition of PII is broad and encompasses not only names, contact information, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers, but also biometrics and a slew of other data.Previously, the FCC required customer notifications only when Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) data was impacted, i.e. phone bill information like subscription plan data, usage charges, numbers called or messaged, and so on.The last update to the FCC's breach reporting requirements was 16 years ago.Middle East & Africa CISOs Plan to Increase 2024 Budgets by 10%From DR GlobalBy Robert Lemos, Contributing Writer, Dark ReadingNew data shows higher-than-expected cybersecurity growth in the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa region, thanks to AI and other factors.The cybersecurity market is expected to grow quickly in the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa (META) region, with spending set to hit $6.5 billion in 2024.According to the IDC, more than three-quarters of CISOs in the region are planning to increase budgets by at least 10% this year, spurred in large part by geopolitical threats, the growth of generative AI, and increasing data protection regulations across the region.""The increase in successful cybercrimes has driven demand for consulting services in non-core countries where awareness is not as high compared to the core countries,"" says Yotasha Thaver, a research analyst for IT security data at IDC South Africa and META. ""There is also a push coming from governments — particularly in the Middle East — for improved cybersecurity.""The spending of course will vary by country. For instance, both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which are actively investing in national strategies to secure their networks and technologies, are in a more high-growth spending trajectory than their peers, IDC found.GenAI Tools Will Permeate All Areas of the EnterpriseMany departments and groups see the benefits of using generative AI tools, which will complicate the security teams' job of protecting the enterprise from data leaks and compliance and privacy violations.There is significant interest among organizations in using generative AI (GenAI) tools for a wide range of use cases, according to Dark Reading's first-ever survey about GenAI. Many different groups within enterprises can use this technology, but these tools seems to be most commonly in use by data analytics, cybersecurity, research, and marketing teams.Almost a third of the respondents say their organizations have pilot programs or are otherwise exploring the use of GenAI tools, while 29% say they are still considering whether to use these tools. Just 22% say their organizations are actively using GenAI tools, and 17% say they are in the process of implementation.Security teams are looking at how these activities can be incorporated into their day-to-day operations, especially for writing code, looking for reference information related to specific threat indicators and issues, and automating investigative tasks.Meanwhile, marketing and sales groups most often use AI generators to create first drafts of text documents or develop personalized marketing messages and summarize text documents. Product and service groups have begun leaning on GenAI for identifying trends in customer needs and creating new designs, while service groups are focused on forecasting trends and integrating technology into customer-facing applications, such as chatbots.Learn more about how Dark Reading readers anticipate using generative AI in the enterprise in this free downloadable report.Should CISOs Skip Ivanti For Now?By Becky Bracken, Editor, Dark ReadingCascading critical CVEs, cyberattacks, and delayed patching are plaguing Ivanti VPNs, forcing cybersecurity teams to scramble for solutions. Researchers are unimpressed.Ivanti has disclosed five VPN flaws so far in 2024, most exploited as zero-days — with two of them publicly announced weeks before patches became available. Some critics, like cybersecurity researcher Jake Williams, see the glut of Ivanti vulnerabilities, and the company's slow incident response, as an existential threat to the business.Williams blames Ivanti's current problems on years-long neglect of secure coding and security testing. To recover, Ivanti would have to overcome that technical debt, according to Williams, while somehow building back trust with their customers. It's a task Williams adds he's dubious Ivanti will be able to pull off.""I don't see how Ivanti survives as an enterprise firewall brand,"" Williams tells Dark Reading, a sentiment he has repeated widely on social media.Ultimately, Ivanti's woes fall on enterprise cyber teams, which will have to choose. Cyber teams can follow CISA's advice and disconnect Ivanti VPN appliances and update before they are reconnected. Or, while they're already offline for patching, they can replace Ivanti appliances altogether with fully updated gear.However, some say that sticking with Ivanti is a juice that may not be worth the squeeze. ""These devices need their software engineered with the same kind of seriousness that this threat requires,"" says John Bambenek, president at Bambenek Consulting. ""If I were a CISO, I'd take a pass on Ivanti for a few years until they’ve proven themselves again.""About the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,regulatory changes and compliance,FALSE
"Russian APT 'Winter Vivern' Targets European Governments, Military","February 17, 2024The Russia-aligned threat group known as Winter Vivern was discovered exploiting cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail servers across Europe in October — and now its victims are coming to light.The group mainly targeted government, military, and national infrastructure in Georgia, Poland, and Ukraine, according to Recorded Future's Insikt Group report on the campaign released today.The report also highlighted additional targets, including the Embassy of Iran in Moscow, the Embassy of Iran in the Netherlands, and the Embassy of Georgia in Sweden.Utilizing sophisticated social engineering techniques, the APT (which Insikt calls TAG-70 and which is also known as TA473, and UAC-0114) used a Roundcube zero-day exploit to gain unauthorized access to targeted mail servers across at least 80 separate organizations, ranging from the transport and education sectors to chemical and biological research organizations.The campaign is thought to have been deployed to gather intelligence on European political and military affairs, potentially to gain strategic advantages or undermine European security and alliances, according to Insikt.The group is suspected of conducting cyber-espionage campaigns serving the interests of Belarus and Russia, and has been active since at least December 2020.Winter Vivern's Geopolitical Motivations for Cyber EspionageThe October campaign was linked to TAG-70's previous activity against Uzbekistan government mail servers, reported by Insikt Group in February 2023.An obvious motivation for the Ukrainian targeting is the conflict with Russia.""In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, compromised email servers may expose sensitive information regarding Ukraine's war effort and planning, its relationships, and negotiations with its partner countries as it seeks additional military and economic assistance, [which] expose third parties cooperating with the Ukrainian government privately, and reveal fissures within the coalition supporting Ukraine,"" the Insikt report noted.Meanwhile, the focus on Iranian embassies in Russia and the Netherlands could be tied to a motive to evaluate Iran's ongoing diplomatic engagements and foreign policy positions, particularly considering Iran's involvement in supporting Russia in the conflict in Ukraine.Similarly, the espionage targeting the Georgian Embassy in Sweden and the Georgian Ministry of Defense probably stems from comparable foreign policy-driven objectives, especially as Georgia has revitalized its pursuit of European Union membership and NATO accession in the aftermath of Russia's incursion into Ukraine in early 2022.Other notable targets included organizations involved in the logistics and transportation industries, which is telling based on the context of the war in Ukraine, as robust logistics networks have proved crucial for both sides in maintaining their ability to fight.Cyber Espionage Defense Is DifficultCyber-espionage campaigns have been ramping up: Earlier this month, a sophisticated Russian APT launched a targeted PowerShell attack campaign against the Ukrainian military, while another Russian APT, Turla, targeted Polish NGOs using a novel backdoor malware.Ukraine has also launched its own cyberattacks against Russia, targeting the servers of Moscow Internet service provider M9 Telecom in January, in retaliation for the Russia-backed breach of Kyivstar mobile phone operator.But the Insikt Group report noted that defending against attacks like these can be difficult, especially in the case of zero-day vulnerability exploitation.However, organizations can mitigate the impact of compromise by encrypting emails and considering alternative forms of secure communications for the transmission of particularly sensitive information.It's also crucial to ensure that all servers and software are patched and kept up-to-date, and users should only open emails from trusted contacts.Organizations should also limit the amount of sensitive information stored on mail servers by practicing good hygiene and reducing data retention and restrict sensitive information and conversations to more secure high-side systems whenever possible.The report also noted that responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities, particularly those exploited by APT actors such as TAG-70, is crucial for several reasons.A threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future's Insikt Group explained via email this approach ensures vulnerabilities are patched and rectified quickly before others discover and abuse them, and enables containment of exploits by sophisticated attackers, preventing broader and more rapid harm.""Ultimately, this approach addresses the immediate risks and encourages long-term improvements in global cybersecurity practices,"" the analyst explained.About the Author(s)You May Also Like",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Google open sources file-identifying Magika AI model,"Google open sources file-identifying Magika AI for malware hunters and othersCool, but it's 2024 – needs more hype, hand wringing, and flashy staged demos to be proper MLGoogle has open sourced Magika, an in-house machine-learning-powered file identifier, as part of its AI Cyber Defense Initiative, which aims to give IT network defenders and others better automated tools.Working out the true contents of a user-submitted file is perhaps harder than it looks. It's not safe to assume the file type from, say, its extension, and relying on heuristics and human-crafted rules – such as those in the widely used libmagic – to identify the actual nature of a document from its data is, in Google's view, ""time consuming and error prone.""Basically, if someone uploads a .JPG to your online service, you want to be sure it's a JPEG image and not some script masquerading as one, which could later bite you in the ass. Enter Magika, which uses a trained model to rapidly identify file types from file data, and it's an approach the Big G thinks works well enough to use in production. Magika is, we're told, used by Gmail, Google Drive, Chrome's Safe Browsing, and VirusTotal to properly identify and route data for further processing.Your mileage may vary. Libmagic, for one, might work well enough for you. In any case, Magika is an example of Google internally using artificial intelligence to reinforce its security, and hopes others can benefit from that tech, too. Another example would be RETVec, which is a multi-language text-processing model used to detect spam. This comes at a time when we're all being warned that miscreants are apparently making more use of machine-learning software to automate intrusions and vulnerability research.Policymakers, security professionals and civil society have the chance to finally tilt the cybersecurity balance from attackers to cyber defenders""AI is at a definitive crossroads — one where policymakers, security professionals and civil society have the chance to finally tilt the cybersecurity balance from attackers to cyber defenders,"" Phil Venables, chief information security officer at Google Cloud, and Royal Hansen, veep of engineering for privacy, safety, and security, said on Friday.""At a moment when malicious actors are experimenting with AI, we need bold and timely action to shape the direction of this technology.""The pair believe Magika can be used by network defenders to identify, fast and at scale, the true content of files, which is a first step in malware analysis and intrusion detection. To be honest, this deep-learning model could be useful for anyone who needs to scan user-provided documents: Videos that are actually executables, for instance, ought to set off some alarm and require closer inspection. Email attachments that aren't what they say they are ought to be quarantined. You get the idea.More generally speaking, in the context of cybersecurity, AI models can not only inspect files for suspicious content and source code for vulnerabilities, they can also generate patches to fix bugs, the Googlers asserted. The mega-corp's engineers have been experimenting with Gemini to improve the automated fuzzing of open source projects, too.Google claims Magika is 50 percent more accurate at identifying file types than the biz's previous system of handcrafted rules, takes milliseconds to identify a file type, and is said to have at least 99 percent accuracy in tests. It isn't perfect, however, and fails to classify file types about three percent of the time. It's licensed under Apache 2.0, the code is here, and its model weighs in at 1MB.- OpenAI shuts down China, Russia, Iran, N Korea accounts caught doing naughty things- Russians invade Microsoft exec mail while China jabs at VMware vCenter Server- California proposes government cloud cluster to sift out nasty AI modelsMoving away from Magika, the Chocolate Factory will also, as part of this new AI Cyber Defense Initiative, partner up with 17 startups in the UK, US, and Europe, and train them to use these types of automated tools to improve their security.It will also expand its $15 million Cybersecurity Seminars Program to help universities train more European students in security. Closer to home, it pledged $2 million in grants to fund research in cyber-offense as well as large language models to support academics at the University of Chicago, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford.""The AI revolution is already underway. While people rightly applaud the promise of new medicines and scientific breakthroughs, we're also excited about AI's potential to solve generational security challenges while bringing us close to the safe, secure and trusted digital world we deserve,"" Venables and Hansen concluded. ®",marketing,marketing,TRUE
New Google Chrome feature blocks attacks against home networks,"Google is testing a new feature to prevent malicious public websites from pivoting through a user's browser to attack devices and services on internal, private networks.More simply, Google plans to prevent bad websites on the internet from attacking a visitor's devices (like printers or routers) in your home or on your computer. People usually consider these devices safe as they're not directly connected to the internet and are protected by a router.""To prevent malicious websites from pivoting through the user agent's network position to attack devices and services which reasonably assumed they were unreachable from the Internet at large, by virtue of residing on the user's local intranet or the user's machine,"" Google described the idea in a support document.Block unsafe requests to internal networksThe proposed ""Private Network Access protections"" feature, which will be in a ""warning-only"" mode in Chrome 123, conducts checks before a public website (referred to as ""site A"") directs a browser to visit another site (referred to as ""site B"") within the user's private network.The checks include verifying if the request comes from a secure context and sending a preliminary request to see if site B (e.g. HTTP server running on loopback address or router's web panel) permits access from a public website through specific requests called CORS-preflight requests.Unlike existing protections for subresources and workers, this feature focuses specifically on navigation requests. Its primary purpose is to shield users' private networks from potential threats.In an example provided by Google, the developers illustrate an HTML iframe on a public website that performs a CSRF attack that changes the DNS configuration of a visitor's router on their local network.<iframe href=""https://admin:admin@router.local/set_dns?server1=123.123.123.123""></iframe>Under this new proposal, when the browser detects that a public site attempts to connect to an internal device, the browser will send a preflight request to the device first.If there is no response, the connection will be blocked. However, if the internal device responds, it can tell the browser whether the request should be allowed using an 'Access-Control-Request-Private-Network' header.This allows requests to devices on an internal network to be automatically blocked unless the device explicitly allows the connection from public websites.While in the warning stage, even if the checks fail, the feature won't block the requests. Instead, developers will see a warning in the DevTools console, giving them time to adjust before stricter enforcement begins.However, Google warns that even if a request is blocked, an automatic reload by the browser will allow the request to go through, as it would be seen as an internal => internal connection.""Private Network Access protections will not apply in this case since the feature was designed to protect users' private network from more-public web pages,"" warns Google.To prevent this, Google proposes to block auto-reloading of a page if the Private Network Access feature previously blocked it.When this happens, the web browser will display an error message stating that you can allow the request to go through by manually reloading the page, as shown below.This page would include a new Google Chrome error message, ""BLOCKED_BY_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ACCESS_CHECKS,"" to tell you when a page can't load because it didn't pass Private Network Access security checks.The idea behind the security upgradeThe motivation behind this development is to prevent malicious websites on the internet from exploiting flaws on devices and servers in users' internal networks, which were presumed safe from internet-based threats.This includes protecting against unauthorized access to users' routers and software interfaces running on local devices—a growing concern as more applications deploy web interfaces assuming nonexistent protections.According to a support document, Google started exploring this idea in 2021 to prevent external websites from making harmful requests to resources within the private network (localhost or a private IP address).While the immediate goal is to mitigate risks like those from ""SOHO Pharming"" attacks and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities, the specification does not aim to secure HTTPS connections for local services—a necessary step for integrating public and non-public resources securely but beyond the current scope of the specification.CommentsSynoptic12 - 3 hours ago""New Google Chrome feature blocks attacks against home networks"".

OpenAI shuts down accounts run by nation-state cyber-crews,"OpenAI shuts down China, Russia, Iran, N Korea accounts caught doing naughty thingsYou don't need us to craft phishing emails or write malware, super-lab sniffsOpenAI has shut down five accounts it asserts were used by government agents to generate phishing emails and malicious software scripts as well as research ways to evade malware detection.Specifically, China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea were apparently ""querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks"" using the super-lab's models. Us vultures thought that was the whole point of OpenAI's offerings, but seemingly these nations crossed a line by using these systems with harmful intent or being straight-up persona non-grata.The biz played up the terminations of service in a Wednesday announcement, stating it worked with its mega-backer Microsoft to identify and pull the plug on the accounts.“We disrupted five state-affiliated malicious actors: two China-affiliated threat actors known as Charcoal Typhoon and Salmon Typhoon; the Iran-affiliated threat actor known as Crimson Sandstorm; the North Korea-affiliated actor known as Emerald Sleet; and the Russia-affiliated actor known as Forest Blizzard,” the OpenAI team wrote.Conversational large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 can be used for things like extracting and summarizing information, crafting messages, and writing code. OpenAI tries to prevent misuse of its software by filtering out requests for harmful information and malicious code.The lab also low-key reiterated GPT-4 isn't that good at doing bad cyber-stuff anyway, mentioning in its announcement that the neural network, available via an API or ChatGPT Plus, ""offers only limited, incremental capabilities for malicious cybersecurity tasks beyond what is already achievable with publicly available, non-AI powered tools.""Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence team shared its own analysis of the malicious activities.

How Businesses Can Safeguard Their Communication Channels Against Hackers,"Efficient communication is a cornerstone of business success. Internally, making sure your team communicates seamlessly helps you avoid friction losses, misunderstandings, delays, and overlaps. Externally, frustration-free customer communication is directly correlated to a positive customer experience and higher satisfaction.However, business communication channels are also a major target for cybercriminals. In recent years, especially since the pandemic, the number of cyberattacks has skyrocketed. Statistics show that last year alone, the number of hacks shot up by 38%. Worse, it still takes a business 277 days on average to identify a breach, causing a loss of $4.35 on average.So, how can businesses safeguard their communication channels against hackers, while still providing the best possible experience for customers and maintaining team productivity? Here's everything you need to know – and which mistakes you need to avoid.Use Secure PlatformsTo begin with, there is your choice of communication channels. In order to meet customers' communication demands, you'll need to offer a variety of channels, from texting, email and live chat to voice and video calls. Not to mention the channels for internal business communication, messaging, and team collaboration tools foremost among them.In the choice of all these channels, you need to prioritize security. When comparing communication platforms, whether UCaaS providers or contact center software, it's crucial to take their security standards into account.Have they been breached before? What server infrastructure and encryption do they rely on? What cybersecurity protocols do they implement? Do they comply with international data security regulations? Do they offer additional security measures such as two-factor authentication?All these are questions you should find the answers to before settling for any communication platform for your business.Audit Your Passwords and PermissionsNext up, your business needs to audit its passwords and review which team members have which permissions.Incredible as it may sound, statistics show that a vast majority of data breaches (fully 80%!) are due to compromised login credentials. They also reveal that 75% of people do not adhere to password best practices, despite knowing better.In fact, ""123456"", ""password"", and ""admin"" still remain on the list of the most frequently used passwords in 2024.Increasing password complexity dramatically reduces the risk of successful cyber breaches. That's why a thorough password review and the implementation of draconic password standards should be high up on your list of priorities to safeguard your business communications.As for the review of permissions, the more people have access to a system, the more likely it is that someone will make a mistake that could result in a breach. Make sure that only those people who really need it have access to sensitive information.Invest in Cybersecurity ProtectionAnother strategy to protect your business communications against hackers is to invest in cybersecurity tools.With the skyrocketing rates of cyber crime and the adoption of technologies such as AI by hackers, cybersecurity companies have ratcheted up their efforts to provide tools to fend them off.Review what cybersecurity tools your company uses. A solid antivirus system, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution and a (team) password manager or vault combined with a strong password policy should be the absolute minimum.Going further, you can invest in financial fraud monitoring, identity theft monitoring for your team members, as well as spam call protection.Cybersecurity monitoring tools, especially, are underutilized by businesses – a major reason for the often months-long delay in detecting a breach. In the event of a hack, it is crucial that you detect it as soon as possible in order to be able to limit the damage and loss of customer trust.Brush Up Your Team's Cybersecurity SkillsThe vast majority of successful cyber breaches are due to human error and not just the choice of weak passwords.Phishing attacks in particular have become more sophisticated in recent years. Long gone are the days in which a Nigerian prince stuck at an airport reached out for a loan.Instead, you get an email from your supervisor towards the end of the business day because he needs your login credentials for a high-level operation.Or you get a message on Slack from a colleague two departments over with a link to sign the virtual birthday card for Sarah from accounting.If hackers really go above and beyond, you might even get a call from your company's CEO asking for your help with a technical issue.In all these cases, many wouldn't think twice about handing over information or clicking the link they're sent, without thinking about spear or voice phishing. And today, that's all it takes to throw the door wide open for cybercriminals to make their way quietly into your communication systems.To prevent any of these scenarios from happening, you need to brush up your team's cybersecurity skills – and their capacities to detect and flag fraud. Having regular cybersecurity training is crucial, as is doing spot checks to make sure everyone adheres to best practices.Develop SOPs and a Cybersecurity RoutineFinally, to protect your business' communication channels from hackers, it's essential to develop standard operating procedures and a fixed cybersecurity routine.Your SOPs should cover not only how to protect your systems, but also what to do in the event of a breach, or the suspicion of one. All your team members should be able to spot suspicious activity and know exactly who to reach out to in the event that they do.Who do they need to alert if they get a spear phishing message to their work phone?What's the procedure if databases are behaving oddly?Which systems need to be shut down first to contain a potential breach?All these are questions that need to be clarified and communicated to your team.Similarly, uncomfortable as it is, you also need to develop backup plans for the worst case scenario of a successful breach. What's your strategy to recover your website if it has been taken hostage? And how do you alert customers to a potential threat?Finally, you need to incorporate cybersecurity into your routines on a daily, weekly, quarterly, and annual basis. Cybercriminals constantly evolve their tactics, and you need to keep up to speed to protect your communications.This means staying up to date on cybersecurity news, new threats, and scams. It also involves regular changes to your passwords, system reviews, and updates to your SOPs.ConclusionProtecting your business communications against hackers is a complex task. It starts with your choice of platforms and cybersecurity tools, but requires constant vigilance. It's crucial to regularly audit your passwords and permissions, educate yourself and your team, and develop cybersecurity SOPs and routines.While all of this takes a considerable amount of time, effort, and resources, it is well worth it. The alternative is to leave yourself wide open and vulnerable to attacks that can have serious financial consequences and result in a total loss of customer trust. In that scenario, the question is when – rather than if – you get breached.Only with the best tools and team members sticking to cybersecurity best practices, and being capable of spotting phishing attacks, will you be able to defend your communication channels.Note: This expert piece is contributed by Hasan Saleem, a successful serial entrepreneur, investor, and founder of multiple technology and e-commerce startups.
