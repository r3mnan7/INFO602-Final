CISA Warns of Active Exploitation Apple iOS and macOS Vulnerability,"The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Wednesday added a high-severity flaw impacting iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-48618 (CVSS score: 7.8), concerns a bug in the kernel component.""An attacker with arbitrary read and write capability may be able to bypass Pointer Authentication,"" Apple said in an advisory, adding the issue ""may have been exploited against versions of iOS released before iOS 15.7.1.""The iPhone maker said the problem was addressed with improved checks. It's currently not known how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world attacks.Interestingly, patches for the flaw were released on December 13, 2022, with the release of iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2, macOS Ventura 13.1, tvOS 16.2, and watchOS 9.2, although it was only publicly disclosed more than a year later on January 9, 2024.It's worth noting that Apple did resolve a similar flaw in the kernel (CVE-2022-32844, CVSS score: 6.3) in iOS 15.6 and iPadOS 15.6, which was shipped on July 20, 2022. It's not immediately clear if the two vulnerabilities are related.""An app with arbitrary kernel read and write capability may be able to bypass Pointer Authentication,"" the company said at the time. ""A logic issue was addressed with improved state management.""In light of the active exploitation of CVE-2022-48618, CISA is recommending that Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies apply the fixes by February 21, 2024.The development also comes as Apple expanded patches for an actively exploited security flaw in the WebKit browser engine (CVE-2024-23222, CVSS score: 8.8) to include its Apple Vision Pro headset. The fix is available in visionOS 1.0.2.",vulnerability reports,security updates and patches,FALSE
"HeadCrab 2.0 Goes Fileless, Targeting Redis Servers for Crypto Mining","Cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of the malware HeadCrab that's known to target Redis database servers across the world since early September 2021.The development, which comes exactly a year after the malware was first publicly disclosed by Aqua, is a sign that the financially-motivated threat actor behind the campaign is actively adapting and refining their tactics and techniques to stay ahead of the detection curve.The cloud security firm said that ""the campaign has almost doubled the number of infected Redis servers,"" with an additional 1,100 compromised servers, up from 1,200 reported at the start of 2023.HeadCrab is designed to infiltrate internet-exposed Redis servers and wrangle them into a botnet for illicitly mining cryptocurrency, while also leveraging the access in a manner that allows the threat actor to execute shell commands, load fileless kernel modules, and exfiltrate data to a remote server.While the origins of the threat actor are presently not known, they make it a point to note in a ""mini blog"" embedded into the malware that the mining activity is ""legal in my country"" and that they do it because ""it almost doesn't harm human life and feelings (if done right).""The operator, however, acknowledges that it's a ""parasitic and inefficient way"" of making money, adding their aim is to make $15,000 per year.""An integral aspect of the sophistication of HeadCrab 2.0 lies in its advanced evasion techniques,"" Aqua researchers Asaf Eitani and Nitzan Yaakov said. ""In contrast to its predecessor (named HeadCrab 1.0), this new version employs a fileless loader mechanism, demonstrating the attacker's commitment to stealth and persistence.""It's worth noting that the previous iteration utilized the SLAVEOF command to download and save the HeadCrab malware file to disk, thereby leaving artifact traces on the file system.HeadCrab 2.0, on the other hand, receives the malware's content over the Redis communication channel and stores it in a fileless location in a bid to minimize the forensic trail and make it much more challenging to detect.Also changed in the new variant is the use of the Redis MGET command for command-and-control (C2) communications for added covertness.""By hooking into this standard command, the malware gains the ability to control it during specific attacker-initiated requests,"" the researchers said.""Those requests are achieved by sending a special string as an argument to the MGET command. When this specific string is detected, the malware recognizes the command as originating from the attacker, triggering the malicious C2 communication.""Describing HeadCrab 2.0 as an escalation in the sophistication of Redis malware, Aqua said its ability to masquerade its malicious activities under the guise of legitimate commands poses new problems for detection.""This evolution underscores the necessity for continuous research and development in security tools and practices,"" the researchers concluded. ""The engagement by the attacker and the subsequent evolution of the malware highlights the critical need for vigilant monitoring and intelligence gathering.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Russian APT28 Hackers Targeting High-Value Orgs with NTLM Relay Attacks,"Russian state-sponsored actors have staged NT LAN Manager (NTLM) v2 hash relay attacks through various methods from April 2022 to November 2023, targeting high-value targets worldwide.The attacks, attributed to an ""aggressive"" hacking crew called APT28, have set their eyes on organizations dealing with foreign affairs, energy, defense, and transportation, as well as those involved with labor, social welfare, finance, parenthood, and local city councils.Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro assessed these intrusions as a ""cost-efficient method of automating attempts to brute-force its way into the networks"" of its targets, noting the adversary may have compromised thousands of email accounts over time.APT28 is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the names Blue Athena, BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, Fighting Ursa, Forest Blizzard (formerly Strontium), FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, ITG05, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and TA422.The group, believed to be active since at least 2009, is operated by Russia's GRU military intelligence service and has a track record of orchestrating spear-phishing campaigns bearing malicious attachments or strategic web compromises to activate the infection chains.In April 2023, APT28 was implicated in attacks leveraging now-patched flaws in networking equipment from Cisco to conduct reconnaissance and deploy malware against select targets.The nation-state actor, in December, came under the spotlight for exploiting a privilege escalation flaw in Microsoft Outlook (CVE-2023-23397, CVSS score: 9.8) and a code execution bug in WinRAR (CVE-2023-38831, CVSS score: 7.8) to access a user's Net-NTLMv2 hash and use it to stage an NTLM relay attack for gaining unauthorized access to mailboxes belonging to public and private sector firms.An exploit for CVE-2023-23397 is said to have been used to target Ukrainian entities as early as April 2022, according to a March 2023 advisory from CERT-EU.It has also been observed leveraging lures related to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war to facilitate the delivery of a custom backdoor called HeadLace, alongside striking Ukrainian government entities and Polish organizations with phishing messages designed to deploy bespoke implants and information stealers like OCEANMAP, MASEPIE, and STEELHOOK.One of the significant aspects of the threat actor's attacks is the continuous attempt to improve its operational playbook, fine-tuning and tinkering with its approaches to evade detection.This includes the addition of anonymization layers such as VPN services, Tor, data center IP addresses, and compromised EdgeOS routers to carry out scanning and probing activities. Another tactic entails sending spear-phishing messages from compromised email accounts over Tor or VPN.""Pawn Storm has also been using EdgeOS routers to send spear-phishing emails, perform callbacks of CVE-2023-23397 exploits in Outlook, and proxy credential theft on credential phishing websites,"" security researchers Feike Hacquebord and Fernando Merces said.""Part of the group's post-exploitation activities involve the modification of folder permissions within the victim's mailbox, leading to enhanced persistence,"" the researchers said. ""Using the victim's email accounts, lateral movement is possible by sending additional malicious email messages from within the victim organization.""It's currently not known if the threat actor themselves breached these routers, or if it is using routers that were already compromised by a third-party actor. That said, no less than 100 EdgeOS routers are estimated to have been infected.Furthermore, recent credential harvesting campaigns against European governments have used bogus login pages mimicking Microsoft Outlook that are hosted on webhook[.]site URLs, a pattern previously attributed to the group.In a sign that the group in no stranger to pivoting and shifting tactics when needed, an October 2022 phishing campaign singled out embassies and other high-profile entities to deliver a ""simple"" information stealer via emails that captured files matching specific extensions and exfiltrated them to a free file-sharing service named Keep.sh.""The loudness of the repetitive, oftentimes crude and aggressive campaigns, drown out the silence, subtlety, and complexity of the initial intrusion, as well as the post-exploitation actions that might occur once Pawn Storm gets an initial foothold in victim organizations,"" the researchers said.The development comes as Recorded Future News revealed an ongoing hacking campaign undertaken by the Russian threat actor COLDRIVER (aka Calisto, Iron Frontier, or Star Blizzard) that impersonates researchers and academics to redirect prospective victims to credential harvesting pages.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
"DirtyMoe Malware Infects 2,000+ Ukrainian Computers for DDoS and Cryptojacking","The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) has warned that more than 2,000 computers in the country have been infected by a strain of malware called DirtyMoe.The agency attributed the campaign to a threat actor it calls UAC-0027.DirtyMoe, active since at least 2016, is capable of carrying out cryptojacking and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In March 2022, cybersecurity firm Avast revealed the malware's ability to propagate in a worm-like fashion by taking advantage of known security flaws.The DDoS botnet is known to be delivered by means of another malware referred to as Purple Fox or via bogus MSI installer packages for popular software such as Telegram. Purple Fox is also equipped with a rootkit that allows the threat actors to hide the malware on the machine and make it difficult to detect and remove.The exact initial access vector used in the campaign targeting Ukraine is currently unknown. CERT-UA is recommending that organizations keep their systems up-to-date, enforce network segmentation, and monitor network traffic for any anomalous activity.The disclosure comes as Securonix detailed an ongoing phishing campaign known as STEADY#URSA targeting Ukrainian military personnel with the goal of delivering a bespoke PowerShell backdoor dubbed SUBTLE-PAWS.""The exploitation chain is relatively simple: it involves the target executing a malicious shortcut (.lnk) file which loads and executes a new PowerShell backdoor payload code (found inside another file contained within the same archive),"" security researchers Den Iuzvyk, Tim Peck, and Oleg Kolesnikov said.The attack is said to be related to a threat actor known as Shuckworm, which is also known as Aqua Blizzard (formerly Actinium), Armageddon, Gamaredon, Iron Tilden, Primitive Bear, Trident Ursa, UNC530, and Winterflounder. Active since at least 2013, it's assessed to be part of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).SUBTLE-PAWS, in addition to setting up persistence on the host, uses Telegram's blogging platform called Telegraph to retrieve the command-and-control (C2) information, a technique previously identified as associated with the adversary since early 2023, and can propagate through removable attached drives.Gamaredon's ability to spread via USB drives was also documented by Check Point in November 2023, which named the PowerShell-based USB worm LitterDrifter.""The new SUBTLE-PAWS attack payload can be viewed as an evolution of the attack payloads by the malicious threat actor involved in the [LitterDrifter] campaign,"" Kolesnikov, vice president of threat research and data science/AI at Securonix, told The Hacker News.""For instance, LitterDrifter is vbscript-based. SUBTLE-PAWS is PowerShell. There are also differences in how these payloads work, SUBTLE-PAWS uses a different persistence mechanism, for example.""""The SUBTLE-PAWS backdoor uses advanced techniques to execute malicious payloads dynamically,"" the researchers said.""They store and retrieve executable PowerShell code from the Windows Registry which can assist in evading traditional file-based detection methods. This approach also aids in maintaining persistence on the infected system, as the malware can initiate itself again after reboots or other interruptions.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Pegasus Spyware Targeted iPhones of Journalists and Activists in Jordan,"The iPhones belonging to nearly three dozen journalists, activists, human rights lawyers, and civil society members in Jordan have been targeted with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware, according to joint findings from Access Now and the Citizen Lab.Nine of the 35 individuals have been publicly confirmed as targeted, out of whom six had their devices compromised with the mercenary surveillanceware tool. The infections are estimated to have taken place from at least 2019 until September 2023.""In some cases, perpetrators posed as journalists, seeking an interview or a quote from victims, while embedding malicious links to Pegasus spyware amid and in between their messages,"" Access Now said.""A number of victims were reinfected with Pegasus spyware multiple times â€” demonstrating the relentless nature of this targeted surveillance campaign.""The Israeli company has been under the radar for failing to implement rigorous human rights safeguards prior to selling its cyber intelligence technology to government clients and law enforcement agencies for ""preventing and investigating terrorism and serious crimes.""NSO Group, in its 2023 Transparency and Responsibility Report, touted a ""significant decrease"" in reports of product misuse during 2022 and 2023, attributing the downturn to its due diligence and review process.""Cyber intelligence technology enables government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to carry out their basic duties to prevent violence and safeguard the public,"" the company noted.""Importantly, it allows them to counter the widespread deployment of end-to-end encryption applications by terrorists and criminals without engaging in mass surveillance or obtaining backdoor access to the devices of all users.""It further sought to ""dispel falsehoods"" about Pegasus, stating it is not a mass surveillance tool, that it's licensed to legitimate, vetted intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and that it cannot take control of a device or penetrate computer networks, desktop, or laptop operating systems.""It is technologically impossible for Pegasus to add, alter, delete, or otherwise manipulate data on targeted mobile devices, or perform any other activities beyond viewing and/or extracting certain data,"" NSO Group said.Despite these assurances, the invasive spyware attacks targeting Jordan civil society members underscore the continued pattern of abuse that run counter to the company's claims.Access Now said the victims' devices were infiltrated with both zero-click and one-click attacks using Apple iOS exploits like FORCEDENTRY, FINDMYPWN, PWNYOURHOME, and BLASTPASS to breach security guardrails and deliver Pegasus via social engineering attacks.The attacks were characterized by the propagation of malicious links to victims via WhatsApp and SMS, with the attackers posing as journalists to increase the likelihood of success of the campaign.The non-profit further said that enabling Lockdown Mode on the iPhones likely prevented some of the devices from being re-infected again with the spyware. It also called on world governments, including Jordan's, to halt the use of such tools and enforce a moratorium on their sale until adequate countermeasures are adopted.""Surveillance technologies and cyberweapons such as NSO Group's Pegasus spyware are used to target human rights defenders and journalists, to intimidate and dissuade them from their work, to infiltrate their networks, and to gather information for use against other targets,"" Access Now said.""The targeted surveillance of individuals violates their right to privacy, freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. It also creates a chilling effect, forcing individuals to self-censor and cease their activism or journalistic work, for fear of reprisal.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,vulnerability reports,FALSE
New Mispadu Banking Trojan Exploiting Windows SmartScreen Flaw,"The threat actors behind the Mispadu banking Trojan have become the latest to exploit a now-patched Windows SmartScreen security bypass flaw to compromise users in Mexico.The attacks entail a new variant of the malware that was first observed in 2019, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said in a report published last week.Propagated via phishing mails, Mispadu is a Delphi-based information stealer known to specifically infect victims in the Latin American (LATAM) region. In March 2023, Metabase Q revealed that Mispadu spam campaigns harvested no less than 90,000 bank account credentials since August 2022.It's also part of the larger family of LATAM banking malware, including Grandoreiro, which was dismantled by Brazilian law enforcement authorities last week.The latest infection chain identified by Unit 42 employs rogue internet shortcut files contained within bogus ZIP archive files that leverage CVE-2023-36025 (CVSS score: 8.8), a high-severity bypass flaw in Windows SmartScreen. It was addressed by Microsoft in November 2023.""This exploit revolves around the creation of a specifically crafted internet shortcut file (.URL) or a hyperlink pointing to malicious files that can bypass SmartScreen's warnings,"" security researchers Daniela Shalev and Josh Grunzweig said.""The bypass is simple and relies on a parameter that references a network share, rather than a URL. The crafted .URL file contains a link to a threat actor's network share with a malicious binary.""Mispadu, once launched, reveals its true colors by selectively targeting victims based on their geographic location (i.e., Americas or Western Europe) and system configurations, and then proceeds to establish contact with a command-and-control (C2) server for follow-on data exfiltration.In recent months, the Windows flaw has been exploited in the wild by multiple cybercrime groups to deliver DarkGate and Phemedrone Stealer malware to steal sensitive data from infected machines and drop more payloads.Mexico has also emerged as a top target for several campaigns over the past year that have been found to propagate information stealers and remote access trojans like AllaKore RAT, AsyncRAT, Babylon RAT. This constitutes a financially-motivated group dubbed TA558 that has attacked the hospitality and travel sectors in the LATAM region since 2018.The development comes as Sekoia detailed the inner workings of DICELOADER (aka Lizar or Tirion), a time-tested custom downloader used by the Russian e-crime group tracked as FIN7. The malware has been observed delivered via malicious USB drives (aka BadUSB) in the past.""DICELOADER is dropped by a PowerShell script along with other malware of the intrusion set's arsenal such as Carbanak RAT,"" the French cybersecurity firm said, calling out its sophisticated obfuscation methods to conceal the C2 IP addresses and the network communications.",data breaches and security incidents,data breaches and security incidents,TRUE
U.S. Sanctions 6 Iranian Officials for Critical Infrastructure Cyber Attacks,"The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions against six officials associated with the Iranian intelligence agency for attacking critical infrastructure entities in the U.S. and other countries.The officials include Hamid Reza Lashgarian, Mahdi Lashgarian, Hamid Homayunfal, Milad Mansuri, Mohammad Bagher Shirinkar, and Reza Mohammad Amin Saberian, who are part of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC).Reza Lashgarian is also the head of the IRGC-CEC and a commander in the IRGC-Qods Force. He is alleged to have been involved in various IRGC cyber and intelligence operations.The Treasury Department said it's holding these individuals responsible for carrying out ""cyber operations in which they hacked and posted images on the screens of programmable logic controllers manufactured by Unitronics, an Israeli company.""In late November 2023, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) revealed that the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa in western Pennsylvania was targeted by Iranian threat actors by exploiting Unitronics PLCs.The attack was attributed to an Iranian hacktivist persona dubbed Cyber Av3ngers, which came to the forefront in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas conflict, staging destructive attacks against entities in Israel and the U.S.The group, which has been active since 2020, is also said to be behind several other cyber attacks, including one targeting Boston Children's Hospital in 2021 and others in Europe and Israel.""Industrial control devices, such as programmable logic controllers, used in water and other critical infrastructure systems, are sensitive targets,"" the Treasury Department noted.""Although this particular operation did not disrupt any critical services, unauthorized access to critical infrastructure systems can enable actions that harm the public and cause devastating humanitarian consequences.""The development comes as another pro-Iranian ""psychological operation group"" known as Homeland Justice said it attacked Albania's Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) and claimed to have stolen terabytes of data.Homeland Justice has a track record of targeting Albania since mid-July 2022, with the threat actor most recently observed delivering a wiper malware codenamed No-Justice.",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
Hands-On Review: SASE-based XDR from Cato Networks,"Companies are engaged in a seemingly endless cat-and-mouse game when it comes to cybersecurity and cyber threats. As organizations put up one defensive block after another, malicious actors kick their game up a notch to get around those blocks. Part of the challenge is to coordinate the defensive abilities of disparate security tools, even as organizations have limited resources and a dearth of skilled cybersecurity experts.XDR, or Extended Detection and Response, addresses this challenge. XDR platforms correlate indicators from across security domains to detect threats and then provide the tools to remediate incidents.While XDR has many benefits, legacy approaches have been hampered by the lack of good-quality data. You might end up having a very good view of a threat from events generated by your EPP/EDR system but lack events about the network perspective (or vice versa). XDR products will import data from third-party sensors, but data comes in different formats. The XDR platform needs to normalize the data, which then degrades its quality. As a result, threats may be incorrectly identified or missed, or incident reports may lack the necessary information for quick investigation and remediation.Cato's Unique Approach to Reducing ComplexityAll of which makes Cato Networks' approach to XDR particularly intriguing. Announced in January, Cato XDR is, as Cato Networks puts it, the first ""SASE-based"" XDR product. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) is an approach that converges security and networking into the cloud. SASE would seem to be a natural fit for XDR as there are many native sensors already in a SASE platform. Gartner who defined SASE in 2019 talks about a SASE platform including ""SD-WAN, SWG, CASB, NGFW and zero trust network access (ZTNA)"" but those are only the required capabilities. SASE may also include advanced security capabilities such as remote browser isolation, network sandboxing, and DNS protection. With so many native sensors already built into the SASE platform, you could avoid the biggest problem with XDR â€“ the lack of good data.Cato SASE Cloud is the prototypical example of what Gartner means by SASE and, on paper at least, Cato XDR would tap the full power of what SASE has to offer goal. The Cato SASE Cloud comes with a rich set of native sensors spanning the network and endpoint -- NGFW, advanced threat prevention (IPS, NGAM, and DNS Security), SWG, CASB, DLP, ZTNA, RBI, and EPP/EDR. The latter, EPP/EDR, is just as new as Cato XDR. Cato EPP is built on Bitdefender's malware prevention technology and stores customer and endpoint data in the same data lake as the rest of the Cato SASE network data. XDR users end up with an incredibly rich ""surround sound"" view (pardon the mixed metaphor) of an incident with detailed data gathered from many native sensors. Cato's capabilities are instantly on and always available at scale, providing a single shared context to hunt for, detect, and respond to threats. For those who have their own EPP/EDR solutions in place, Cato can work for them as well. Cato XDR integrates with leading EDR providers such as Microsoft Defender, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne.Testing EnvironmentThe review is going to focus on a day in the life of a security analyst using Cato XDR. We'll learn how an analyst can see a snapshot of the security threats on the network and the process for investigating and remediating them. In our scenario, we've been informed of malware at 10:59 PM. We'll investigate and then remediate the incident.It's important to understand that Cato XDR is not sold as a standalone product, but as part of the larger Cato SASE Cloud. It leverages all capabilities â€“ sensors, analytics, UI and more â€“ of the Cato SASE Cloud. So, to fully appreciate Cato XDR, one should be familiar with the rest of the Cato platform to best appreciate the simplicity and â€“ what Cato calls ""elegance"" â€“ of the platform. But doing so would make it difficult, if not impossible, to have room to review Cato XDR. We chose to take a cursory look at Cato overall but then focus on Cato XDR. (You can see a more complete albeit outdated review of the platform from back in 2017.)Getting into Cato XDRAs we enter the Cato SASE Cloud platform, they're greeted with a customized view of the enterprise network. Security, access, and networking capabilities are available from pull-down menus across the top and dashboards and specific capabilities for investigation, detection, and response, and practices assessments down the vertical. Accessing Cato XDR is under the Detection & Response section. To explore Cato XDR capabilities, visit Cato XDR.|Cato XDR is accessible from the left-hand side of the screen (indicated by the red box). Note: topology shown does not reflect our test environment.Putting Cato XDR to the TestClicking on the Stories Dashboard of Cato XDR gives us an overall view of the stories in the enterprise (see below). A ""story"" for Cato is a correlation of events generated by one or multiple sensors. The story tells the narrative of a threat from its inception to resolution. The first thing we noticed is that the Stories Dashboard has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, making it simple to navigate and understand for security analysts of varying skill levels. We feel this is crucial for efficient investigations and decision-making.To get a quick understanding of the overall risk score of the account, we looked at the AI-powered Account Risk Score widget. In this case, the overall risk score is 75â€”so, fairly high. This tells us we need to dig in and see what's leading to such a high score. There are 55 incidents stories in all, 24 of which are open and 30 of which are closed.|The Cato XDR Stories Dashboard summarizes the state of stories across the enterprise. Across the top, AI is used to evaluate the overall risk of the account (1) with the status of the various stories and additional counters across vertical (2).Below the overall summary line, we have widgets help us understand our stories from different perspectives. The highest priority stories are sorted by an AI-powered criticality store (1). The score is based on all the story risk scores for the selected time range and is calculated using a formula developed by the Cato research and development team. This is helpful in telling us which stories should be addressed first. We can also quickly see the hosts (Top 5 Hosts) and sites (Top 5 Sites) involved in the most stories (2). Scrolling down we see additional graphs capturing the story breakdown by criticality (3); Indicator of Attack (IoA) such as Malware Activity, Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), and Suspicious Network Activity (4); and MITRE ATT&CK techniques, such as Application Layer Protocol, Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, and Automated Exfiltration Mitigation (5).|Widgets help tell the threat story from different perspectives by criticality (1), the hosts and sites involved in the most stories (2), story breakdown by criticality (3), by IoAs (4), and by Mitre ATT&CK techniques (5).As analysts, we want to see which stories are open. A click on the 24 open stories in the summary line of the Stories Dashboard brings us to the Stories Workbench page (also accessible from the navigation on the left-side of the screen), which displays a prioritized list of all stories for efficient triage and better focus. Cato uses an AI-powered Criticality score to rank the stories (1). We can also add more filters and narrow down the list even further to enable better focus in the filter row (2). Grouping options also enable easier analysis (3).|The Stories Workbench lists the available Stories, which in this case is filtered to show the Open stories ranked by criticality (1). Further filtering (2) and grouping (3) options allow for efficient triage and investigation.We decided to examine the distribution of threats in the Stories Workbench screen by grouping threats by their Unique Indications. Now, we can see threats by category -- Malware Activity, Suspicious Network Activity, Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), and so on. DGA is a technique used by malware authors to dynamically generate many domain names. This is commonly employed by certain types of malware, such as botnets and other malicious software, to establish communication with command-and-control servers. We went to the final story at 10:59 PM and opened it for investigation.|The Stories Workbench screen grouped by indications, showing the stories with domain generation algorithms (DGAs). We investigated the final DGA story.The investigation screen shows a methodological process with tools for analyzing threats from the top down, gaining a high-level understanding of situation and then delving deeper into the investigation. First is the summary line of the story (1). We can see that the type of attack detected is Domain Generation Algorithm, that this is a threat-hunting story, and that the number of Associated Signals, which are the network flows that make up the story, is 26. Threat hunting stories contain correlated security events and network flows and using AI/ML and Threat Hunting heuristics to detect elusive signatureless and zero-day threats that cannot be blocked by prevention tools.We can see that the story duration is nine days, indicating that we found Associated Signals within a time span of nine days, and of course, that the status of the story is open. Next, we see the status line, which records the actions that took place in the story (2). Currently, we see that the status was ""created."" Additional actions will be added as we work on the story. Moving on to the details, we can quickly see that the Domain Generation Algorithm, or DGA, was found on Robin's Host 7. We see that the attack direction is outbound, and the AI-powered criticality score is 5.For an easy-to-read understanding of the story, we can click on the ""See Summary"" button. Cato's Gen AI engine summarizes the results of the screen in easy-to-read text. Details include the type of communication, the IP source, the targets, why the story was detected, and if any actions were taken automatically, such as blocking the traffic.|Clicking on the ""Story Summary"" button (1) generates a textual summary of the screen using Cato's Gen AI engine.Closing the Story Summary and staying on the investigation screen, we gain additional insights about the story. Cato's machine learning-powered Predicted Verdict analyzes the various indicators in the story and based on previous knowledge provides an expected verdict (1). Another smart insight is the ""Similar Stories,"" which is also powered by AI and, when relevant, will link to stories with similar characteristics. There's also the Playbook Knowledge Base (highlighted) to guide us on how to investigate stories of Malicious Target Communication.On the right side of the screen, we can see the source details (2): the IP, the OS, and the client. We see that this is a Tor browser, which can be suspicious. Tor is a web browser specifically designed for privacy and anonymity, and attackers often use it to conceal their identity and activity online.We can see the attack geolocation source (3), which communicates with different countries on different parts of the map. This can also be suspicious. Next, we look at the Target Actions box (4) where we can see actions that relate to every target involved in this story. Since this is a threat-hunting story, we can see a correlation between a broad set of signals.Scrolling down we examine the attack distribution timeline. We can see here that the communication to the targets has been going on for nine days.|The attack distribution timeline provides a chronological list of the attacks on the various targets. Clicking on the targets allows analysts to add or remove them from the graphic to better see the attack pattern.By filtering out some of the targets, we can see patterns of communications, which are easily observable. We clearly see a periodic activity that is indicative of bot- or script- initiated communication. Under the attack timeline, the Targets table (1) provides additional details about the targets, including their IPs, domain names, and related threat intelligence. The targets are sorted by malicious score. This is a smart score powered by AI and ML that takes all of Cato's threat intelligence sources, both proprietary and third party, and calculates the score between zero and one to indicate whether the IP is considered highly malicious or not.|Removing all but four of the targets show a periodic communication pattern, which is indicative of a bot or script. Below the attack distribution timelines is the Targets table with extensive information about the targets in the investigation.The popularity column shows if the IP is ""popular"" or ""unpopular"" as determined by Cato's proprietary algorithm measuring how often an IP or domain is visited according to Cato internal data. Unpopular IPs or domains are often indicative of suspicious IPs or domains. We can gain external threat intelligence information about the target by clicking third-party threat intelligence links such as VirusTotal, WhoIs, and AbusePDB.|External threat intelligence sources are just a click away from within the Targets table.Scrolling down to the Attack Related Flows table, we can view more granular details about the raw network flows that compose the story, such as the start time of the traffic and the source and destination ports. In this particular case, the destination ports are unusually high (9001) and less common, which raises a red flag.Documenting What We Found with CatoLet's summarize our findings from our test case. We found suspicious network activity related to domain generation algorithm that uses the Tor client. The IP has low popularity, high malicious scoring, and the communication follows a specific pattern in distinct times. So, we can now reach a conclusion. We suspect that there is a malware installed on the source endpoint, Robin's Host 7, and that it's trying to communicate outside using Tor infrastructure.Now let's set up the verdict in the screen below. We'll classify the story as malicious. The analyst severity would be medium. The type is anonymizer. We can see the details in the image below. The classification would be DGA. Then we can save the verdict on this incident story.|The security analyst can document a verdict to help others understand the threat.Once saved, we can see that that opening threat hunting screen has been updated. The second row now shows that the analyst has set the severity to Medium, and the verdict is set to malicious. Now the response would be to mitigate the threat by configuring a firewall rule.Mitigate The Threat with CatoNormally, analysts would need to jump to another platform to take action, but in the case of Cato it can all be done right in the XDR platform.

Akira ransomware attacks linked to Cisco vuln fixed in 2020,"Nearly 4-year-old Cisco vuln linked to recent Akira ransomware attacksEvidence mounts of an exploit gatekept within Russia's bordersSecurity researchers believe the Akira ransomware group could be exploiting a nearly four-year-old Cisco vulnerability and using it as an entry point into organizations' systems.In eight of security company TrueSec's most recent incident response engagements that involved Akira and Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN as the entry point, at least six of the devices were running versions vulnerable to CVE-2020-3259, which was patched in May 2020.The vulnerability lies in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software, allowing attackers to extract secrets stored in memory in clear text such as usernames and passwords â€“ Ã  la CitrixBleed.TrueSec said that because there is no publicly available exploit code for the Cisco vulnerability, it means cybercriminals like those working for Akira would either need to have bought that exploit from somewhere or developed one of their own, which would require a deep understanding of the flaw.Akira is long known to be targeting Cisco VPNs as the initial access vector for ransomware attacks, but the possible exploitation of the old vulnerability is the new finding here.Analysis of past cases has been stymied by the ""generally non-existent"" network logs in environments, according to Heresh Zaremand, senior consultant at TrueSec, and these were barely even enough to pinpoint AnyConnect as the point of access.In one recent incident, however, the TrueSec team managed to restore six months of radius authentication logs from an NPS server, the analysis of which revealed a pattern of malicious behavior that heavily hinted towards but didn't quite prove the use of an exploit.The researchers' observations that suggested the likely use of an exploit included:-Attackers authenticating using genuine credentials that had recently been used by the real account holder-Eight different accounts were compromised, though only two were used for lateral movement-Compromised accounts had distinct usernames that didn't follow any predictable naming conventions, and all used unique passwords-No evidence of phishing campaigns targeting the organization-No evidence of password attacks in the restored logs-No evidence of the credentials for sale on the dark webZaremand said there was no way of determining what data an attacker had accessed following an exploit, and that if they did get in, they likely exploited the device multiple times to access different parts of its memory content.""If your organization is running Cisco AnyConnect, and assuming the device has been patched since a fix for CVE-2020-3259 was available, it is highly recommended that you backtrack when your device was upgraded to a non-vulnerable version,"" he added.- Akira ransomware gang says it stole passport scans from Lush in 110 GB data heist- Cybercrooks play dress-up as 'helpful' researchers in latest ransomware ruse- Stanford schooled in cybersecurity after Akira claims ransomware attack- Ransomware fiends pounce on Cisco VPN brute-force zero-day flaw""This is important as it is not possible to determine for how long this vulnerability has been exploited. For instance, if your backtracking shows that your devices were upgraded six months ago, then it is sound to consider any username and password used for the AnyConnect SSL VPN which has not changed in the last six months as compromised.""In such cases, organizations are advised to initiate broad password resets and consider any other secrets or pre-shared keys in the device's configuration compromised.Enabling MFA is the de facto advice given to organizations following an attack, and, of course, apply the patches if you haven't already.Russia's 'prints all over it'When CVE-2020-3259 was disclosed, there were no known publicly available exploits, and that remains true to this day.The vulnerability was discovered by Russian security research outfit Positive Technologies in 2020, which was placed on the US sanctions list a year later. According to the US Treasury, Positive Technologies helped Russian intelligence (FSB) with its security services and helped run conventions the FSB used as recruitment events.Zaremand said TrueSec wasn't suggesting there are any ties between Akira and Russian intelligence, but offensive security research does appear to end up in the hands of both cybercriminals and nation states.He also pointed to the widely held belief that Akira, which recently claimed an attack on cosmetics giant Lush, is an offshoot born from Conti's demise in 2022, and that Conti itself was thought to have had ties to the FSB.

Law enforcement obtained a court order granting them permission to ""remotely disable aspects of the Chinese hacking campaign.""This criminal crew's campaign first came to light in May 2023, after Microsoft and intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes nations disclosed that Volt Typhoon had accessed networks belonging to US critical infrastructure organizations as far back as 2021.The vector is typically vulnerable Internet-facing devices â€” such as buggy routers, modems, security cameras and other kit â€” to access corporate networks. The crew uses command line tools to steal credentials and other sensitive data, and then uses those credentials to maintain persistence on the system, and the PRC-backed group upgraded their tactics, it seems.American government officials are reportedly concerned about the Chinese hackers disrupting US critical networks, including military installations, utilities, and internet service providers.

Chinese cyber agents plan to incite 'societal chaos' in US,"Congress told how Chinese goons plan to incite 'societal chaos' in the USAmerican public is way ahead of themChinese attackers are preparing to ""wreak havoc"" on American infrastructure and ""cause societal chaos"" in the US, infosec, and law enforcement bosses told a US House committee on Wednesday.""The fact that PRC hackers are targeting our critical infrastructure, water treatment plants, our electrical grid, our oil and natural gas pipelines, our transportation systems â€” and the risk that poses to every American requires our attention,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Select Committee on competition with China.The hearing coincided with the FBI's confirmation that it obtained search warrants and issued a remote kill command to wipe Volt Typhoon's botnet after the Chinese crew infected hundreds of end-of-life routers and attempted to break into American critical infrastructure targets.After breaking into victims' routers the Volt Typhoon crew evades detection by using legitimate IP addresses and credentials, plus other tools to communicate with their spymasters and move throughout the target environment.Such incidents are no longer a ""theoretical threat,"" added US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly, noting that CISA has seen Volt Typhoon ""burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to enabled active attacks in the event of a major crisis.""""This is a world major crisis halfway across the planet, could well endanger the lives of Americans here at home, through the disruption of our pipelines, the severing of our telecommunications, the pollution of our water facilities, the crippling of our transportation modes, all to ensure that they can incite societal panic and chaos, and to deter our ability to marshal military might and civilian will,"" she added.Earlier reports suggested that American government officials were worried that this nation-state group was biding its time and planning to disrupt military installations, utilities and internet service providers if China invaded Taiwan and the US provided support for the island nation.""Their aim is clear: In the early stages of a conflict, they want to disrupt our military's ability to mobilize, and to impact the systems that allow us to thrive in our increasingly digital world,"" said Harry Coker Jr, director of the Office of the National Cyber Director. This puts critical infrastructure owners and operators, the vast majority of whom are private organizations, ""on the front lines,"" he added.But in addition to attacking US energy grids or water systems, which would likely incite a kinetic war, China also has less overtly destructive cybertools at its disposal including disinformation, spread via TikTok and other social media, and AI capabilities such as deepfakes intending to sway US elections.These aren't easy problems to solve. As Wray has repeatedly noted â€” and did again in front of the House panel â€” Chinese cyber spies outnumber the FBI's cyber agents 50 to one.- FBI confirms it issued remote kill command to blow out Volt Typhoon's botnet- We know nations are going after critical systems, but what happens when crims join in?- Five Eyes and Microsoft accuse China of attacking US infrastructure again- US cyber spymaster calls TikTok China's 'Trojan horse'The US agency directors also told lawmakers the US needs better partnerships and threat-sharing between the private sector and the government, as well as government agencies setting clear cybersecurity requirements and providing assistance to victim organizations.In addition to these challenges, there's the ongoing cybersecurity skills shortage, which Coker said includes half a million open infosec jobs.Fixing these problems also requires holding software companies liable for buggy products, according to Easterly. This is a battle cry that Easterly repeated during her CISA tenure. The agency wants vendors to make their tech ""secure-by-design,"" so it's safe out of the box, and this responsibility isn't passed on to businesses and end users.""Unfortunately, the technology underpinning our critical infrastructure is inherently insecure because of decades of software developers not being held liable for defective technology that has led to incentives where features and speed to market have been prioritized against security, leaving our nation vulnerable to cyber invasion,"" Easterly told the House subcommittee.""Technology manufacturers must ensure that China and other cyber actors cannot exploit the weaknesses in our technology, to saunter through the open doors of our critical infrastructure to destroy it,"" she added.

Warning: New Malware Emerges in Attacks Exploiting Ivanti VPN Vulnerabilities,"Google-owned Mandiant said it identified new malware employed by a China-nexus espionage threat actor known as UNC5221 and other threat groups during post-exploitation activity targeting Ivanti Connect Secure VPN and Policy Secure devices.This includes custom web shells such as BUSHWALK, CHAINLINE, FRAMESTING, and a variant of LIGHTWIRE.""CHAINLINE is a Python web shell backdoor that is embedded in a Ivanti Connect Secure Python package that enables arbitrary command execution,"" the company said, attributing it to UNC5221, adding it also detected multiple new versions of WARPWIRE, a JavaScript-based credential stealer.The infection chains entail a successful exploitation of CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887, which allow an unauthenticated threat actor to execute arbitrary commands on the Ivanti appliance with elevated privileges.The flaws have been abused as zero-days since early December 2023. Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) said it's aware of ""multiple compromised systems"" in the country.BUSHWALK, written in Perl and deployed by circumventing the Ivanti-issued mitigations in highly-targeted attacks, is embedded into a legitimate Connect Secure file named ""querymanifest.cgi"" and offers the ability to read or write to files to a server.On the other hand, FRAMESTING is a Python web shell embedded in an Ivanti Connect Secure Python package (located in the following path ""/home/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cav-0.1-py3.6.egg/cav/api/resources/category.py"") that enables arbitrary command execution.Mandiant's analysis of the ZIPLINE passive backdoor has also uncovered its use of ""extensive functionality to ensure the authentication of its custom protocol used to establish command-and-control (C2).""Furthermore, the attacks are characterized by the use of open-source utilities like Impacket, CrackMapExec, iodine, and Enum4linux to support post-exploitation activity on Ivanti CS appliances, including network reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data exfiltration within victim environments.Ivanti has since disclosed two more security flaws, CVE-2024-21888 and CVE-2024-21893, the latter of which has come under active exploitation targeting a ""limited number of customers.""

"U.S. Feds Shut Down China-Linked ""KV-Botnet"" Targeting SOHO Routers","The U.S. government on Wednesday said it took steps to neutralize a botnet comprising hundreds of U.S.-based small office and home office (SOHO) routers hijacked by a China-linked state-sponsored threat actor called Volt Typhoon and blunt the impact posed by the hacking campaign.The existence of the botnet, dubbed KV-botnet, was first disclosed by the Black Lotus Labs team at Lumen Technologies in mid-December 2023. The law enforcement effort was reported by Reuters earlier this week.""The vast majority of routers that comprised the KV-botnet were Cisco and NetGear routers that were vulnerable because they had reached 'end of life' status; that is, they were no longer supported through their manufacturer's security patches or other software updates,"" the Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a press statement.Volt Typhoon (aka DEV-0391, Bronze Silhouette, Insidious Taurus, or Vanguard Panda) is the moniker assigned to a China-based adversarial collective that has been attributed to cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S. and Guam.""Chinese cyber actors, including a group known as 'Volt Typhoon,' are burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to be ready to launch destructive cyber attacks in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States,"" CISA Director Jen Easterly noted.The cyber espionage group, believed to be active since 2021, is known for its reliance on legitimate tools and living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to fly under the radar and persist within victim environments for extended periods of time to gather sensitive information.Another important aspect of its modus operandi is that it tries to blend into normal network activity by routing traffic through compromised SOHO network equipment, including routers, firewalls, and VPN hardware, in an attempt to obfuscate their origins.This is accomplished by means of the KV-botnet, which commandeers devices from Cisco, DrayTek, Fortinet, and NETGEAR for use as a covert data transfer network for advanced persistent threat actors. It's suspected that the botnet operators offer their services to other hacking outfits, including Volt Typhoon.In January 2024, a report from cybersecurity firm SecurityScorecard revealed how the botnet has been responsible for compromising as much as 30% â€” or 325 of 1,116 â€” of end-of-life Cisco RV320/325 routers over a 37-day period from December 1, 2023, to January 7, 2024.""Volt Typhoon is at least one user of the KV-botnet and [...] this botnet encompasses a subset of their operational infrastructure,"" Lumen Black Lotus Labs said, adding the botnet ""has been active since at least February 2022.""The company told The Hacker News that KV-botnet was operated separately, with the threat actors behind it performing their own reconnaissance and targeting, while also supporting multiple groups like Volt Typhoon.The botnet is also designed to download a virtual private network (VPN) module to the vulnerable routers and set up a direct encrypted communication channel to control the botnet and use it as an intermediary relay node to achieve their operational goals.""One function of the KV-botnet is to transmit encrypted traffic between the infected SOHO routers, allowing the hackers to anonymize their activities (i.e., the hackers appear to be operating from the SOHO routers, versus their actual computers in China),"" according to affidavits filed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).As part of its efforts to disrupt the botnet, the agency said it remotely issued commands to target routers in the U.S. using the malware's communication protocols to delete the KV-botnet payload and prevent them from being re-infected. The FBI said it also notified every victim about the operation, either directly or via their internet service provider if contact information was not available.""The court-authorized operation deleted the KV-botnet malware from the routers and took additional steps to sever their connection to the botnet, such as blocking communications with other devices used to control the botnet,"" the DoJ added.It's important to point out here that the unspecified prevention measures employed to remove the routers from the botnet are temporary and cannot survive a reboot. In other words, simply restarting the devices would render them susceptible to re-infection.""The Volt Typhoon malware enabled China to hide, among other things, pre-operational reconnaissance and network exploitation against critical infrastructure like our communications, energy, transportation, and water sectors â€“ steps China was taking, in other words, to find and prepare to destroy or degrade the civilian critical infrastructure that keeps us safe and prosperous,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said.However, the Chinese government, in a statement shared with Reuters, denied any involvement in the attacks, dismissing it as a ""disinformation campaign"" and that it ""has been categorical in opposing hacking attacks and the abuse of information technology.""Coinciding with the takedown, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published new guidance urging SOHO device manufacturers to embrace a secure by design approach during development and shift the burden away from customers.Specifically, it's recommending that manufacturers eliminate exploitable defects in SOHO router web management interfaces and modify default device configurations to support automatic update capabilities and require a manual override to remove security settings.The compromise of edge devices such as routers for use in advanced persistent attacks mounted by Russia and China highlights a growing problem that's compounded by the fact that legacy devices no longer receive security patches and do not support endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.""The creation of products that lack appropriate security controls is unacceptable given the current threat environment,"" CISA said.

Just 29% of ransomware victims paid their attackers in Q4,"Ransomware payment rates drop to new low â€“ now 'only 29% of victims' fork over cashIt's almost like years of false assurances have made people realize payments are pointlessTrusting a ransomware crew to honor a deal isn't the greatest idea, and the world seems to be waking up to that. It's claimed that number of victims who chose to pay dropped to a new low of 29 percent in the last quarter of 2023.The data from ransomware response and negotiation company Coveware continues a downward trend since it began monitoring in 2019, when it said the rate of companies choosing to pay ransomware actors was a whopping 85 percent. The reason for the change, Coveware founder and CEO Bill Siegel states in the company's latest quarterly report, comes down to awareness.Not only are more ransomware victims prepared for the inevitability of attacks by keeping better backups, Siegel points out, but several years of ransomware making top headlines â€“ and associated stories of payments amounting to nothing â€“ have led to a reluctance to trust data kidnappers.There's just no honor among thieves, it seems â€“ even digital ones.""Q4 was rife with examples of how data assurances can fail, even when interacting with well-known 'brand established' ransomware groups,"" Siegel says. ""Threat actors cannot be trusted to prevent ongoing misuse/publication of stolen data, and â€¦ payments to them for these imaginary assurances have zero if not sub-zero value.""Along with a decrease in overall ransomware payments, Coveware found that payments for data exfiltration-only incidents also hit an all-time low since it began tracking them in 2022. While 53 percent of companies were paying such demands two years ago, only 26 percent did so in the fourth quarter of 2023.Further proof a ransomware payment ban is a bad moveCoveware's takeaway is that the world is making progress in dealing with ransomware that a payment ban would completely undo.""A ban would signal that as a country, we are admitting that we are incapable of defending ourselves,"" Siegel states. He adds that early experiments with payment bans have been largely ineffective. The report cites a Florida ban on ransomware payments that took effect on July 1, 2022, noting that ""we have not yet seen a decline in attacks inside [Florida and other] states"" that have enacted a payment ban, like North Carolina.- US officials close to persuading allies to not pay off ransomware crooks- Ransomware payment ban: Wrong idea at the wrong time- Formal ban on ransomware payments? Asking orgs nicely to not cough up ain't working- Be honest. Would you pay off a ransomware crew?Instead, Siegel offered reporting requirements, like those enacted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, as a major reason for the progress. If a nationwide payment ban were enacted, that progress would be unpicked, the report argues.""There would still be demand for ransom payment services because people and organizations will do what they must to survive,"" says Siegel. Enact a payment ban, and compliance with reporting rules may decrease as companies make payments through offshore accounts and ""re-order the flow of money through a new illegal market of service providers.""Like ransomware criminals themselves, illegal service providers could easily take the money and run.Safe harbors, encouraging companies to work with law enforcement, and more awareness of how to stay safe is the key, Coveware insists.""Greater costs must be imposed on the threat actors by changing the incentives of the victims,"" Siegel says in the report.

Earlier Tuesday, news broke that the FBI had obtained a court order to remotely disable parts of the PRC-backed crew's cyber campaign.""We've been involved in incident response cases, as well as using our intelligence and capabilities to track that group and identify where they've been targeting,"" Lee said.These targets, he added are ""very strategic sites, the types of sites you'd really want to go after in conflict, focusing on US energy systems, as well as US satellite and telecommunication networks.""Volt Typhoon ""consistently chooses industrial targets, goes after those targets, and plays this low and slow game,"" Lee said.This particular espionage gang, he added, has the resources and the technical capabilities to develop ""Pipedream-like capabilities.""Pipedream, an industrial control system (ICS) specific malware that Dragos uncovered in April 2022 after spotting it in an unnamed organization's OT environment. Mandiant calls this set of ICS attack tools ""Incontroller,"" and notes that it is ""consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS.""The malware doesn't exploit a particular vulnerability in these systems, but rather allows the operators to interact with a variety of industrial equipment from multiple vendors, and then disrupt or even physically destroy critical devices.Shortly after the threat hunters sounded the alarm on this new nation-state cyber weapon, several US government agencies (CISA, NSA, FBI and Department of Energy) warned that programmable logic controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron Electronics, Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture servers and other devices were at risk.To date, Drgos does not believe Pipedream has been used in a critical infrastructure attack, Lee said.""It was the thing they were ready to use when they were ready to go to armed conflict,"" he said. ""That capability allows you to interact with industrial networks and environments to cause physical destruction. And it works on all the different industries from a water system to a carbon cracker to a servomotor on an unmanned aerial vehicle.""- US shorts China's Volt Typhoon crew targeting America's criticals- Five Eyes and Microsoft accuse China of attacking US infrastructure again- CISA and friends raise alarm on critical flaws in industrial equipment, infrastructure- Threat group builds custom malware to attack industrial systemsThe malware ""takes advantage of native functionality"" inside of industrial environments, meaning that it can't be fixed by patching a hole or updating the software or firmware, Lee added.This means the threat still exists.""What concerns me is other countries are working on very similar capabilities,"" Lee said. ""And these capabilities are going to start proliferating to criminals.""Presumably countries like Russia and China would wait and use these types of destructive attacks against critical systems during times or war. The Volt Typhoon campaign, for example, could allow China to disrupt US military operations in the Indo-Pacific region in the case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, according to some national security sources.However, once profit-motivated criminal gangs get ahold of these types of tools, Lee said he expects these destructive attacks to become more commonplace. He pointed to the rise in popularity of Cobalt Strike and other legitimate offensive security tools among ransomware gangs to prove this point.""Criminal actors no longer needed to develop their own capabilities, malicious software vulnerabilities, etc.,"" Lee said. ""They literally buy off-the shelf tools that are commonly used, and then just worry about operating them.""When Cobalt Strike became available, ""you saw massive amounts of criminal groups spin up overnight being able to leverage it.

"FTC to Blackbaud: We're not gonna fine you, but do better","Blackbaud settles with FTC after that IT breach exposed millions of people's infoCloud software slinger admits no guilt, promises better basic security hygieneBlackbaud, which had data on millions of people stolen from it by one or more crooks, has promised to shore up its IT defenses in a proposed deal with the FTC.In announcing the draft settlement, the US watchdog's boss Lina Khan, Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, and Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya blasted Blackbaud â€“ a cloud software provider for schools, charities, and other orgs â€“ for its ""unfair and deceptive data security practices"" in a statement [PDF].""The FTC charges that Blackbaud's reckless data retention practices rendered its security failures much more costly: by hoarding reams of data that it did not reasonably need, Blackbaud's breach exposed far more data,"" they said.""Moreover, Blackbaud's notification alerting victims of the breach included false statements, which Blackbaud did not correct until months later â€” and months after it knew the statements were false.""Back in February 2020, according to a formal complaint [PDF] raised by the FTC, criminals broke into Blackbaud's databases, remained undetected for three months, and stole files on about 13,000 of the biz's customers. Those files contained ""the personal information of millions of consumers,"" the regulator saidAfter being detected, the intruders extorted the software maker, and Blackbaud allegedly agreed to pay the miscreants about $235,000 to quietly go away and delete any pilfered documents, according to the FTC complaint. However, Blackbaud wasn't able to verify that the crims really did scrap the swiped data.Then, in June 2020, the biz finally got around to alerting its customers about the privacy breach. At the time it assured them: ""The cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers.""This turned out to be false, we're told. According to the FTC, Blackbaud knew as early as July 31, 2020, ""that the attacker had exfiltrated consumers' bank account numbers and social security numbers."" The business didn't, however, disclose that to customers until October 2020.- Cloud biz Blackbaud caved to ransomware gang's demands â€“ then neglected to inform customers for two months- 'We stopped ransomware' boasts Blackbaud CEO. And by 'stopped' he means 'got insurance to pay off crooks'- What happens if you 'cover up' a ransomware infection? For Blackbaud, a $3m charge- Biden will veto attempts to kill off SEC's security breach reporting rulesIn March 2023, Blackbaud agreed to pay $3 million to settle charges brought by America's financial watchdog the SEC accusing the IT player of making misleading statements about its security fiasco.Then in October that year, attorneys general from all 50 US states secured another $49.5 million settlement over Blackbaud's ""deficient data security practices and inadequate response"" to the network breach.As part of this latest settlement [PDF], brokered with the FTC, Blackbaud has agreed to delete or destroy customer backup files containing sensitive information that is not needed to provide products or services to these customers. That's supposed to reduce the risk of personal data being stolen in future.Blackbaud also agreed to publicize its updated data retention policy, outlining what specific customer info it maintains, why the outfit has it, and give a solid timeframe for deleting these files.Plus, the firm has to put into place an overhauled infosec program that includes, among other things, multi-factor authentication; data loss tools; penetration testing; and encryption of, at a minimum, customers' Social Security numbers, passport numbers, tax IDs, driving licenses and other government-issued identification, plus bank account, credit card, and debit card information, dates of birth, medical information, and user account credentials.That last part is important because, according to the watchdog, Blackbaud's failure to encrypt sensitive data, plus holding onto this information for far longer than was necessary, made the security breach far worse than it would have been otherwise.A Blackbaud spokesperson told The Register the company neither admits nor denies any of the FTC's allegations in its proposed settlement, which is awaiting final sign-off from the regulator.""We are pleased to resolve this matter with the FTC,"" said Mike Gianoni, president and CEO, Blackbaud.

"FritzFrog Returns with Log4Shell and PwnKit, Spreading Malware Inside Your Network","The threat actor behind a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet known as FritzFrog has made a return with a new variant that leverages the Log4Shell vulnerability to propagate internally within an already compromised network.""The vulnerability is exploited in a brute-force manner that attempts to target as many vulnerable Java applications as possible,"" web infrastructure and security company Akamai said in a report shared with The Hacker News.FritzFrog, first documented by Guardicore (now part of Akamai) in August 2020, is a Golang-based malware that primarily targets internet-facing servers with weak SSH credentials. It's known to be active since January 2020.It has since evolved to strike healthcare, education, and government sectors as well as improved its capabilities to ultimately deploy cryptocurrency miners on infected hosts, claiming more than 1,500 victims over the years.What's novel about the latest version is the use of the Log4Shell vulnerability as a secondary infection vector to specifically single out internal hosts rather than targeting vulnerable publicly-accessible assets. Akamai is tracking the activity under the name Frog4Shell.""When the vulnerability was first discovered, internet-facing applications were prioritized for patching because of their significant risk of compromise,"" security researcher Ori David said.""Contrastly, internal machines, which were less likely to be exploited, were often neglected and remained unpatched â€” a circumstance that FritzFrog takes advantage of.""This means that even if the internet-facing applications have been patched, a breach of any other endpoint can expose unpatched internal systems to exploitation and help propagate the malware.The SSH brute-force component of FritzFrog has also received a facelift of its own to identify specific SSH targets by enumerating several system logs on each of its victims.Another notable change in the malware is use of the PwnKit flaw tracked as CVE-2021-4034 to achieve local privilege escalation.""FritzFrog continues to employ tactics to remain hidden and avoid detection,"" David said. ""In particular, it takes special care to avoid dropping files to disk when possible.""This is accomplished by means of the shared memory location /dev/shm, which has also been put to use by other Linux-based malware such as BPFDoor and Commando Cat, and memfd_create to execute memory-resident payloads.The disclosure comes as Akamai revealed that the InfectedSlurs botnet is actively exploiting now-patched security flaws (from CVE-2024-22768 through CVE-2024-22772, and CVE-2024-23842) impacting multiple DVR device models from Hitron Systems to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

Cloudflare publishes details of Thanksgiving security breach,"Cloudflare sheds more light on Thanksgiving security breach in which tokens, source code accessed by suspected spiesAtlassian systen compromised via October Okta intrusionCloudflare has just detailed how suspected government spies gained access to its internal Atlassian installation using credentials stolen via a security breach at Okta in October.In a write-up on Thursday, CEO Matthew Prince, CTO John Graham-Cumming, and CISO Grant Bourzikas said the Atlassian intrusion was detected all the way back on Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 2023, and that the trespassers were ejected the following day.The October Okta security breach involved more than 130 customers of that IT access management biz, in which snoops swiped data from Okta in hope of drilling further into those organizations. Cloudflare was among those affected, as it was in 2022 as a result of a separate Okta intrusion.Cloudflare acknowledged in October it was caught up in Okta's latest security meltdown, and is now disclosing more details about what happened.The intruders â€“ likely agents of a nation state, according to Prince et al â€“ obtained one service token and three service account credentials through that 2023 Okta compromise. At the time, Okta indicated that information stolen from its customer support systems was pretty benign, and could be used in things like phishing or social engineering attacks. It turns out that session tokens, granting access into networks of the likes of Cloudflare, were taken from Okta's systems.""One was a Moveworks service token that granted remote access into our Atlassian system,"" said Prince, Graham-Cumming, and Bourzikas on that note.""The second credential was a service account used by the SaaS-based Smartsheet application that had administrative access to our Atlassian Jira instance, the third account was a Bitbucket service account which was used to access our source code management system, and the fourth was an AWS environment that had no access to the global network and no customer or sensitive data.""Because Cloudflare incorrectly believed those tokens were unused, it failed to rotate them. So the thief or thieves were able to use them to gain access to Cloudflare's systems.- Okta data breach dilemma dwarfs earlier estimates- Okta October breach affected 134 orgs, biz admits- Cloudflare exiles baseboard management controller from its server motherboards- Cloudflare defends firing of staffer for reasons HR could not explainFrom November 14, 2023 through November 17, 2023, the intruders appear to have been probing Cloudflare's systems, doing reconnaissance through its Confluence-based internal wiki, and its Jira bug database.Further accesses were detected on November 20 and 21, following by the establishment of a persistence presence in the cloud corp's Atlassasian server via ScriptRunner for Jira. Having administrative access to Jira via the Smartsheet service, the snoops were able to install the Sliver Adversary Emulation Framework, a common tool for command-and-control connectivity and backdoor access.The intruders also gained access to Cloudflare's Bitbucket source code management system, but efforts to access a console server linked to a not-yet-active datacenter in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil failed.The intruders, according to the cloud giant, scoured the biz's wiki for information about remote access, secrets, and tokens. Also of interest were 36 Jira tickets, out of more than two million, that focused on vulnerability management, secret rotation, multi-factor authentication bypass, network access, and even the biz's response to the Okta incident.This attack was performed by a nation-state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflareâ€™s global networkThe spies' interest in secrets was also evident in the 120 Bitbucket code repositories viewed out of a total of almost 12,000. Some 76 of the 120 were downloaded to the Atlassian server. While Cloudflare is uncertain whether these were exfiltrated, it's treating them as such. These repos were mostly related to the way backups work, global network configuration and management, identity, remote access, and Terraform and Kubernetes. A few contained encrypted secrets and those were immediately rotated even though they were strongly encrypted, according to the US CDN giant.""Even though we understand the operational impact of the incident to be extremely limited, we took this incident very seriously because a threat actor had used stolen credentials to get access to our Atlassian server and accessed some documentation and a limited amount of source code,"" said Prince et al.""Based on our collaboration with colleagues in the industry and government, we believe that this attack was performed by a nation-state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflareâ€™s global network.""Cloudflare managed to expel the attackers by November 24, 2023, and set about assessing the damage and investigating what happened. Three days later, a company-wide remediation effort dubbed ""Code Red"" became the focus of much of its technical staff. And this project was assisted by external security firm Crowdstrike, which carried out an independent assessment of the cyber-assault.Code Red concluded on January 5, 2024, but according to Prince, Graham-Cumming, and Bourzikas ""work continues across the company around credential management, software hardening, vulnerability management, additional alerting, and more.""

Feds cough up 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals,"Ignore Uncle Sam's 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your perilWhat is on HHS paper will most likely become law, Google security boss saysInterview If you are responsible for infosec at an American hospital or other healthcare organization, and you treat the US government's new ""voluntary"" cybersecurity performance goals (CPGs) as, well, voluntary, you're ignoring the writing on the wall.Plus, you're going to be in for a world of hurt when new regulations â€“ which will very likely mirror these voluntary practices â€“ take effect, according to Taylor Lehmann, a director in Google Cloud's Office of the Chief Information Security Officer.""The benefit of the CPG is that it indicates where the ball is bouncing next, and what the standards and expectations are for what organizations should be working on,"" Lehmann told The Register.Lehmann, a former CISO of Athenahealth and Tufts Medicine, said the proof is in previous federal agency rulemaking processes.""It may not be today, but what is on HHS paper will most likely become what is in the actual final rulemaking or new regulatory requirements that become law,"" he said. ""If you buy into the fact that voluntary doesn't mean you have to do something, you are probably going to be wrong. Voluntary goals become mandatory, and that has usually been the case with other rulemaking in healthcare as it relates to security.""In early January, as a record-breaking 46 health networks with a total of 141 hospitals between them were still reeling from ransomware infections and data theft in 2023, rumors started swirling that the White House would soon require US hospitals to meet basic cybersecurity standards before receiving federal funding.During all of this, the criminals behind the intrusions were using their own increasingly dangerous extorion methods to force hospitals to pay ransom demands.When asked about the hospital rules, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services directed The Register to a concept paper published in December that outlines the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) cybersecurity strategy.According to the paper [PDF], officials will propose new, enforceable security standards, and will work with Congress to administer financial support and incentives for hospitals to implement ""high-impact cybersecurity practices,"" among other actions.Later in January, HHS released the voluntary, healthcare-specific CPGs.Essential doesn't mean easyThese goals are divided into two categories, essential and enhanced, and each has ten specific things that organizations can do to better protect themselves from cyberattacks.The essential goals sound like base-level security â€“ the kind of things one would hope that hospitals and clinics already have in place.But, according to Lehmann, they are all based on real-world exploits and compromises. ""Basically what the sector experienced over the last year,"" he said. ""I'd love to say these are super obvious, but clearly they are not all being done.""They include mitigating known vulnerabilities, using multi-factor authentication, implementing email security, training employees in secure behaviors, encrypting sensitive data, and revoking credentials for employees, contractors, and volunteers when they leave the organization.Basic incident response planning, using unique credentials, separating user and privileged accounts, and assessing vendor and supplier risks round out the essential goals.""The point is, basics aren't always necessarily easy. The basics can be super hard,"" Lehmann said.- Uncle Sam tells hospitals: Meet security standards or no federal dollars for you- LockBit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children's hospital- 'Exemplar' digital hospitals trust hit by multiple tech-related traumas- After injecting cancer hospital with ransomware, crims threaten to swat patientsHealthcare networks, especially those with clinics and hospitals in smaller, rural communities, aren't running modern technology stacks. Some of their equipment is decades old, and they can't afford to upgrade it or hire enough employees to support their security goals.""The tech debt has stacked up for years, and to overcome it, in many cases, will put organizations out of business,"" Lehmann said. ""It happened this summer.""He's referring to an Illinois hospital that said it would shut down in part because of a ransomware infection.This isn't to say large hospitals are immune from ransomware or other cyberattacks. Case in point: CommonSpirit Health, America's second-largest nonprofit healthcare org, diverted ambulances and shut down electronic record systems at its facilities and hospitals across 21 states.""We're going to keep struggling â€“ that is, until the point where HHS steps in, which is what they have alluded to doing,"" Lehmann said.Still, implementing even the essential goals like multi-factor authentication, for example, can present difficulties.""How are you going to get 15,000 people to do two-factor authentication enrollment in a window of time? And with appropriate resourcing, to make sure if a catastrophic event occurs and we're in the middle of a two-factor enrollment, that we don't have to shut the hospital down? If these things aren't done well, they can have catastrophic operational impacts on really sensitive life-saving things,"" Lehmann said.Another of the essential goals â€“ revoking credentials when people leave the organization â€“ isn't as easy as it sounds either.""Not if you're an academic medical system where you've got five or more academic institutions, and you don't know when those students graduate, you don't know when they leave,"" Lehmann said.He added that the essential goals do ""miss the point"" a bit by focusing primarily on preventing attacks, instead of equally prioritizing resilience and recovery. For too long, data confidentiality, and protecting patient's PII and health information, has been seen as the only goal in securing healthcare because failing to protect confidential information is what gets hospitals in trouble with government agencies.""Availability is equally important, if not more important, than confidentiality,"" Lehmann said, adding that many healthcare orgs haven't yet progressed to this way of thinking about security.

Cloudflare Breach: Nation-State Hackers Access Source Code and Internal Docs,"Cloudflare has revealed that it was the target of a likely nation-state attack in which the threat actor leveraged stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to its Atlassian server and ultimately access some documentation and a limited amount of source code.The intrusion, which took place between November 14 and 24, 2023, and detected on November 23, was carried out ""with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflare's global network,"" the web infrastructure company said, describing the actor as ""sophisticated"" and one who ""operated in a thoughtful and methodical manner.""As a precautionary measure, the company further said it rotated more than 5,000 production credentials, physically segmented test and staging systems, carried out forensic triages on 4,893 systems, reimaged and rebooted every machine across its global network.The incident involved a four-day reconnaissance period to access Atlassian Confluence and Jira portals, following which the adversary created a rogue Atlassian user account and established persistent access to its Atlassian server to ultimately obtain access to the Bitbucket source code management system by means of the Sliver adversary simulation framework.As many as 120 code repositories were viewed, out of which 76 are estimated to have been exfiltrated by the attacker.""The 76 source code repositories were almost all related to how backups work, how the global network is configured and managed, how identity works at Cloudflare, remote access, and our use of Terraform and Kubernetes,"" Cloudflare said.""A small number of the repositories contained encrypted secrets which were rotated immediately even though they were strongly encrypted themselves.""The threat actor is then said to have unsuccessfully attempted to ""access a console server that had access to the data center that Cloudflare had not yet put into production in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.""The attack was made possible by using one access token and three service account credentials associated with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Atlassian Bitbucket, Moveworks, and Smartsheet that were stolen following the October 2023 hack of Okta's support case management system.Cloudflare acknowledged that it had failed to rotate these credentials, mistakenly assuming they were unused.The company also said it took steps to terminate all malicious connections originating from the threat actor on November 24, 2023. It also involved cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to perform an independent assessment of the incident.""The only production systems the threat actor could access using the stolen credentials was our Atlassian environment.

This is to prevent any possibility of an attacker gaining upgrade persistence. Ivanti said the process will take up to four hours to complete.Given the state of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, it goes without saying that these patches should be applied as soon as possible.To recap, earlier this month security researchers at Volexity disclosed the two-bug zero-day exploit they believed to be carried out by an unknown group with a suspected China nexus. The researchers said the vulnerabilities make it ""trivial"" for remote unauthenticated attackers to achieve code execution.At the time, Ivanti said fewer than ten victims were believed to have been breached but this quickly increased and was under mass exploitation within days.Ivanti also said it would develop patches not by version order, but according to the version with the most installs. Patches were expected to drop between January 22 and February 19, but some of these have since been delayed slightly.Customers in the meantime were advised to apply the mitigation available via the Ivanti download portal and use the external version of Ivanti's internal integrity checker (ICT), alongside proactive threat-hunting practices to monitor for suspected compromises.To make matters worse, this week the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said Ivanti's mitigation was bypassed by some sophisticated attackers.""Threat actors are continuing to leverage vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways to capture credentials and/or drop webshells that enable further compromise of enterprise networks,"" the alert reads.""Some threat actors have recently developed workarounds to current mitigations and detection methods and have been able to exploit weaknesses, move laterally, and escalate privileges without detection. CISA is aware of instances in which sophisticated threat actors have subverted the external ICT, further minimizing traces of their intrusion.""CISA suggests organizations should continue to proactively hunt for threats to systems connected to vulnerable Ivanti devices. It also advised monitoring account authentication, usage, and identity management services that could be exposed, isolating them from enterprise resources where possible.In releasing today's round of patches, Ivanti also updated its mitigation in a bid to keep attackers at bay for now. This can be applied via the download portal like the last one.- US shorts China's Volt Typhoon crew targeting America's criticals- Ivanti and Juniper Networks accused of bending the rules with CVE assignments- BreachForums admin 'Pompourin' sentenced to 20 years of supervised release- Russians invade Microsoft exec mail while China jabs at VMware vCenter ServerThe vendor didn't mention any changes being made to the external ICT, however, despite current intelligence indicating attackers can get around its detection capabilities.More zero-days?That mitigation will also apply to the two additional zero-days announced today which affect all supported versions of Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA gateways.""Upon learning of these vulnerabilities, we immediately mobilized resources and the patch is available now via the standard download portal for Ivanti Connect Secure,"" said Ivanti in an advisory.""It is critical that you immediately take action to ensure you are fully protected.""Tracked as CVE-2024-21888 and CVE-2024-21893, they both carry high-severity CVSS scores. Ivanti's descriptions for both are:-CVE-2024-21888: A privilege escalation vulnerability in web component of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x) allows a user to elevate privileges to that of an administrator-CVE-2024-21893: A server-side request forgery vulnerability in the SAML component of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA allows an attacker to access certain restricted resources without authenticationIvanti said there is no evidence to suggest that CVE-2024-21888 is under active exploitation, but a small number of customers have been hit by the server-side request forgery flaw.It's not clear if the discovery of these two additional vulnerabilities was the cause of the overall delay in the patch schedule. The Register has asked Ivanti to comment.A spokesperson at Ivanti sent a statement:""The security of our customers is our top priority. As part of our ongoing investigation, we discovered two additional vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure. We included a fix for these vulnerabilities and previously identified vulnerabilities in the patch released today, and patches planned for release for additional versions will also include a comprehensive fix. And the patches released on January 31 cover the majority of our customers. We have also provided a new mitigation in the best interest of customers while the remaining patch versions are in development.""We strongly encourage customers to apply the patch for their version as it becomes available. While additional patch versions are in development, they should apply the mitigation and run the internal and external ICT.""

Managing the hidden risks of shadow APIs,"How F5 Distributed Cloud Services seal security gaps in modern app development amid growing attack surfacePartner Content Application programming interfaces (APIs) play a significant role in today's digital economy, but at the same time they can also represent a data security vulnerability.While APIs serve as building blocks to modern app development, their proliferation and sprawl have also been exploited by bad actors targeting web apps to initiate data breaches, account takeover, fraud and other threats.API endpoints increase an application's attack surface area and introduce vulnerabilities and compliance issues that traditional app security tools struggle to mitigate. Compounding the problem are the countless outdated or undocumented APIs, dubbed shadow APIs, that connect to applications which organizations have long forgotten or hardly ever use. Many of these were built to facilitate internal tests or work around various limitations in a bid to speed up the integration of multiple, disparate systems. But without proper management, continuous monitoring, and security controls, they have also introduced persistent risks in real-world deployments and operations.A discussion at an F5-Google webinar this year explored the difficulty involved in ascertaining whether performance issues and other disruptions occurring in systems and applications were signs that API sprawl was a contributing factor to cyber attacks. What we do know is that organizations commonly struggle with visibility into the state of API security. Security, governance, and efficiency challenges are further compounded by the increased adoption of hybrid cloud infrastructure and microservices. Multi-cloud complexity and multi-app business processes make enforcing consistent security difficult, and vulnerabilities that exist within APIs deployed or integrated into larger applications are hard to mitigate and even harder to remediate.Key ways to manage shadow APIs entail API documentation and inventory, API Discovery, API validation, and comprehensive visibility into the security of API endpoints.API documentation and inventoryThe F5 Distributed Cloud API Security solution is built to provide deep insights with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to identify shadow APIs, block API attacks in real time, and eliminate vulnerabilities at their source.This requires a solid process for publishing APIs with proper documentation which records how the API behaves and how it interacts with other APIs. This approach solves the problem of app developers deploying public APIs, bypassing internally mandated security processes and procedures, and pushing them into production without proper documentation.With F5 Distributed Cloud Web App and API Protection, security teams can build a comprehensive inventory of all known APIs, their endpoints and expected operations. Since APIs change frequently, the process runs periodically to ensure that the API inventory is up to date.API discovery and validationAPI discovery and validation are complemented by two other fundamental elements of API security â€“ authentication and authorization. Authentication verifies the identity of users or systems trying to access an API based on username/password, API keys, tokens and biometrics. Authorization limits the actions an authenticated user or system is allowed to perform within the API through access control rules, roles and permissions.The F5 Distributed Cloud Platform automatically discovers API endpoints mapped to applications, blocks unwanted connections and suspicious requests, and monitors for anomalous behavior or shadow APIs to prevent data leakage. To prevent injection attacks and other exploits, input validation rules define what is considered valid data. This process ensures that the data received from external sources, such as user inputs or APIs, are safe, reliable and free from malicious content.Comprehensive visibilityIn today's dynamic API landscape, maintaining comprehensive visibility into the security posture of API endpoints is paramount.All critical app and API security controls necessary to protect an app's entire ecosystem can be deployed and managed through the unified API security console of the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform. This allows DevOps and SecOps teams to observe and quickly identify suspected API abuse as anomalies are detected as well as create policies to stop misuse.This requires the use of ML models to create baselines of normal API usage patterns. Continuous ML-based traffic monitoring allows API security to predict and block suspicious activity over time. Deviations from these baselines and other anomalies trigger alerts or automated responses to detect outliers, including rogue and shadow APIs.Dashboards play a crucial role in providing the visibility required to monitor and assess the security of APIs. The F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP platform extends beyond basic API inventory management by presenting essential security information based on actual and attack traffic. Specifically, the API Endpoints Dashboard presents the Top Attacked APIs by percentage of attacks, Top Sensitive Data types found, Total API calls broken down by response code, and Most Active APIs.Critical information â€“ such as discovered sensitive data types, threat levels determined by attack traffic, authentication status, API category and the API's risk score â€“ enables DevOps and SecOps teams to quickly identify potential vulnerabilities, prioritize remediation efforts, and make informed decisions to strengthen the security posture of the APIs.Intelligent risk mitigationThe SaaS-based F5 Distributed Cloud Platform enables users to manage and tap on threat analytics, forensics, and troubleshooting of API communications in modern applications.AI is used to identify complex attack patterns and zero-day vulnerabilities that traditional rule-based systems cannot detect. Methods such as behavioral analytics to detect suspicious behavior may indicate potential threats from malicious users while risk-based controls step up the authentication process, making it more stringent with any increase in perceived threat level.The F5 solution scans and tests APIs in a runtime environment to uncover vulnerabilities in APIs before they are in production, where remediation is more costly and frustrating. It detects and blocks attacks listed in the OWASP API Top 10 in real time at the development and production layer.Ultimately the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform is designed to enable unified management of infrastructure and workloads across multiple compute environments for flexible deployment, secure app-to-app interconnection, and consistent policy enforcement across cloud, data center and edge as well as the application lifecycle.This approach to API security heralds something of a shift in the common risk management approach, especially with the rise of shadow APIs. Enterprising and innovative organizations now have the power to correlate data insights at scale through comprehensive cross-platform visibility and the intense power of AI and ML.This article was contributed by F5.",marketing,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
LockBit remorseless in latest children's hospital attack,"LockBit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children's hospitalIt even had the gall to set the ransom demand at $800K â€¦ for a nonprofitRansomware gang LockBit is claiming responsibility for an attack on a Chicago children's hospital in an apparent deviation from its previous policy of not targeting nonprofits.Stooping to new lows, the criminals are reportedly unwilling to reverse the attack on Saint Anthony Hospital, as they had done in previous cases such as Toronto's SickKids hospital.What's more, it apparently thinks a nonprofit hospital has the funds to pay a $800,000 ransom. Saint Anthony Hospital has not explicitly stated whether it will or won't pay, but with a sum this large it's highly unlikely that it would ever consider paying, let alone have the funds available to do so.The deadline for payment has been set at 01:41 UTC on February 2. A $1,000 payment would extend the timer for 24 hours, and $800,000 is the price assigned to the data â€“ that goes for both the destruction of it or the purchase of it by other parties.Saint Anthony Hospital confirmed the attack via a statement published this week, saying files containing patient information had been copied by an unknown attacker. The hospital didn't specify the nature of the stolen data but confirmed no medical or financial records were accessed.LockBit's intrusion began on December 18 but the hospital's internal investigation didn't conclude patient data was compromised until January 7. In the meantime, it said it took immediate action to secure its network and ensure patient care remained uninterrupted.""Saint Anthony holds cybersecurity and the privacy of patient information in its care as top priorities,"" it said [PDF]. ""Our prompt response to this event allowed us to continue providing patient care without disruption.""As part of Saint Anthony's ongoing commitment to data privacy, we are working to review existing policies and procedures and implement additional ones as needed. Saint Anthony promptly reported this incident to the FBI and is cooperating with their investigation. We also reported this incident to appropriate regulators, including the US Department of Health and Human Services.""As the review of the incident progresses, the hospital said it would notify those it believes are impacted by the data theft. Until then, all patients are advised to remain vigilant to identity or financial fraud attempts and sign up for a free year of credit monitoring.LockBit had in some previous cases shown a degree of restraint when targeting the likes of hospitals and other nonprofits, yet appears to be loosening the shackles on its affiliates, allowing them to target any organization they're able to breach.In response to an affiliate that attacked Toronto's SickKids hospital last year, LockBit formally apologized, issued a free decryptor, and supposedly booted that affiliate out of its program for violating the rules.In a post to its leak blog this week, LockBit said: ""Always US hospitals put their greedy interest over those of their patients and clients.""We've been unable to get in touch with the spokesperson for the gang to ask about the attack and shift in approach, but the malware collectors at vx-underground were under the impression that LockBit was either ignorant to the fact Saint Anthony was a nonprofit, or simply didn't care.Asked about the reasons for the attack, the gang reportedly responded by sending the hospital's financial disclosures, suggesting it either thought it was indeed a corporate entity or confused the meaning of ""nonprofit"" for an organization that generates zero revenue.- EquiLend drags systems offline after admitting attacker broke in- Subway's data torpedoed by LockBit, ransomware gang claims- Freight giant Estes refuses to deliver ransom, says personal data opened and stolen- FBI develops decryptor for BlackCat ransomware, seizes gang's websiteSaint Anthony's website clearly states that it's ""an independent, nonprofit, faith-based, acute care, community hospital."" So the decision to press ahead with the attack appears to be nothing more than a senseless money grab.""If you attempt to educate and present information to LockBit administrative staff on nonprofit institution laws in the United States they will state the organization is corrupt and they will imply (directly or indirectly) it is a money laundering operation and the facility is dirty and deserves to be ransomed,"" said vx-underground.""In summary: the rules are a facade.""Similar ignorance was demonstrated by LockBit leadership in attacks on the education sector, flippantly responding by saying: ""If they have money for computers, they have money to pay me.""Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET, said that cybercriminals will always pursue attacks that align with their business goals.""Although ransomware gangs may have chosen to avoid organizations such as hospitals and not-for-profits in the past, business is business and criminal goals are no different.""The evolution of cybersecurity over the last decade has proved that criminal gangs have also had to pivot in terms of how they attack and financially conquer. Ransomware has become a different beast where data has become even more of the focal point in the way it has become a weapon of extortion rather than just relying on an encryption attack followed by ransom demands.""No one remains safe from these attacks whether they are targeted or caught up in larger campaigns. Companies should never believe they are foolproof due to the nature of their business, nor should they reduce the best possible protection they have to offer.""

Ivanti devices hit by exploits for yet another security hole,"Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security holeAt this point you might be better off just shutting the stuff downVarious miscreants are attempting to exploit the latest Ivanti flaw, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-21893 that can be used to hijack equipment.That's according to threat hunters tracking the string of CVE-listed security holes plaguing the VPN gateways in recent weeks.Ivanti on January 31 disclosed and began patching CVE-2024-21893, which is present in the SAML component of of Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x) appliances. The vendor spotted the flaw as it was investigating and scrambling to patch two other zero-day bugs in those products: an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2023-46805), and a common injection flaw (CVE-2024-21887), both of which are also under attack.Crooks latched onto CVE-2024-21893 because the vulnerability can be used to bypass mitigation efforts for those pair of earlier flaws and gain control of network gateways.""At the time of publication, the exploitation of CVE-2024-21893 appears to be targeted,"" Ivanti claimed last week, adding that it expected exploitation to ramp up sharply as word of the security hole spread.""The SSRF can be chained to CVE-2024-21887 for unauthenticated command injection with root privileges,"" Rapid7 principal security researcher Stephen Fewer added on February 2.The security shop also published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for CVE-2024-21893 that same day.And unsurprisingly, the infosec watchers at ShadowServer observed attempts to open backdoors on vulnerable equipment and other exploitation attempts by snoops. ""To date, over 170 attacking IPs involved,"" according to the org, which noted it did spot exploitation prior to the Rapid7 PoC.When asked about the attacks this month, an Ivanti spokesperson directed The Register to its earlier security alert. As of February 1, the vendor had issued a patch addressing all known vulnerabilities for Ivanti Connect Secure version 22.5R2.2 and Ivanti Policy Secure 22.5R1.1.- Ivanti releases patches for VPN zero-days, discloses two more high-severity vulns- Ivanti zero-day exploits explode as bevy of attackers get in on the act- Congress told how Chinese goons plan to incite 'societal chaos' in the US- US shorts China's Volt Typhoon crew targeting America's criticalsAlso last week, the US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued its second emergency directive about the flawed Ivanti systems, requiring federal agencies running Ivanti Connect Secure or Ivanti Policy Secure to disconnect these products from agency networks by February 2.

Why the Right Metrics Matter When it Comes to Vulnerability Management,"How's your vulnerability management program doing? Is it effective? A success? Let's be honest, without the right metrics or analytics, how can you tell how well you're doing, progressing, or if you're getting ROI? If you're not measuring, how do you know it's working?And even if you are measuring, faulty reporting or focusing on the wrong metrics can create blind spots and make it harder to communicate any risks to the rest of the business.So how do you know what to focus on? Cyber hygiene, scan coverage, average time to fix, vulnerability severity, remediation rates, vulnerability exposureâ€¦ the list is endless. Every tool on the market offers different metrics, so it can be hard to know what is important.This article will help you identify and define the key metrics that you need to track the state of your vulnerability management program, the progress you've made, so you can create audit-ready reports that:- Prove your security posture- Meet vulnerability remediation SLAs and benchmarks- Help pass audits and compliance- Demonstrate ROI on security tools- Simplify risk analysis- Prioritize resource allocationWhy you need to measure vulnerability managementMetrics play a critical role in gauging the effectiveness of your vulnerability and attack surface management. Measuring how quickly you find, prioritize and fix flaws means you can continuously monitor and optimize your security.With the right analytics, you can see which issues are more critical, prioritize what to fix first, and measure the progress of your efforts. Ultimately, the right metrics allow you to make properly informed decisions, so you're allocating the resources to the right places.The number of vulnerabilities found is always a good starting point, but it doesn't tell you much in isolation â€“ without prioritization, advisories and progress, where do you start? Finding, prioritizing and fixing your most critical vulnerabilities is far more important to your business operations and data security than simply finding every vulnerability.Intelligent prioritization and filtering out the noise are important because overlooking genuine security threats is all too easy when you're being overwhelmed by non-essential information. Intelligent results make your job easier by prioritizing issues that have real impact on your security, without burdening you with irrelevant weaknesses.For example, your internet-facing systems are the easiest targets for hackers. Prioritizing issues that leave this exposed makes it easier to minimize your attack surface. Tools like Intruder make vulnerability management easy even for non-experts, by explaining the real risks and providing remediation advice in easy-to-understand language. But beyond prioritization, what else should or could you be measuring?|An example of Intruder's vulnerability management report page5 top metrics for every vulnerability management programScan coverageWhat are you tracking and scanning? Scan coverage includes all the assets you're covering and analytics of all business-critical assets and applications, and the type of authentication offered (e.g., username- and password-based, or unauthenticated).As your attack surface evolves, changes and grows over time, it's important to monitor any changes to what's covered and your IT environment, such as recently opened ports and services. A modern scanner will detect deployments you may not have been aware of and prevent your sensitive data from becoming inadvertently exposed. It should also monitor your cloud systems for changes, discover new assets, and automatically synchronize your IPs or hostnames with cloud integrations.Average time to fixThe time it takes your team to fix your critical vulnerabilities reveals how responsive your team is when reacting to the results of any reported vulnerabilities. This should be consistently low since the security team is accountable for resolving issues and delivering the message and action plans for remediation to management. It should also be based on your pre-defined SLA. The severity of the vulnerability should have a corresponding relative or an absolute period of time for planning and remediation.Risk scoreThe severity of each issue is automatically calculated by your scanner, usually Critical, High or Medium. If you decide not to patch a specific or group of vulnerabilities within a specified time period, this is an acceptance of risk. With Intruder you can snooze an issue if you're willing to accept the risk and there are mitigating factors.For example, when you're preparing for a SOC2 or ISO audit and you can see a critical risk, you may be willing to accept it because the resource required to fix it isn't justified by the actual level of risk or potential impact on the business. Of course, when it comes to reporting, your CTO may want to know how many issues are being snoozed and why!IssuesThis is the point from a vulnerability going public, to having scanned all targets and detecting any issues. Essentially, how quickly are vulnerabilities being detected across your attack surface, so you can fix them and reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker.What does this mean in practice? If your attack surface is increasing, you may find that it takes you longer to scan everything comprehensively, and your mean time to detect may increase as well. Conversely, if your mean time to detect stays flat or goes down, you're using your resources effectively. If you start to see the opposite, you should ask yourself why it's taking longer to detect things? And if the answer is the attack surface has ballooned, maybe you need to invest more in your tooling and security team.Measuring progressPrioritization â€“ or intelligent results â€“ is important to help you decide what to fix first, because of its potential impact on your business. Intruder filters out the noise and helps reduce false positives, which is a key metric to track because once you reduce the amount of noise you can circle back and focus on the most important metric â€“ the average time to fix.Why is this important? Because when you do find an issue, you want to be able to fix it as quickly as possible. Tools like Intruder use multiple scanning engines to interprets the output and prioritize the results according to context, so you can save time and focus on what really matters.|When a new vulnerability that could critically affect your systems is identified, Intruder will automatically kick-off a scanAttack surface monitoringThis helps you see the percentage of assets that are protected across your attack surface, discovered or undiscovered. As you team spins up new apps, vulnerability scanner should check when a new service is exposed, so you can prevent data from becoming inadvertently exposed. Modern scanners monitor your cloud systems for changes, finding new assets, and synchronizing your IPs or hostnames with your integrations.Why is this important? Your attack surface will inevitably evolve over time, from open ports to spinning up new cloud instances, you need to monitor these changes to minimize your exposure. That's where our attack surface discovery comes in. The number of new services discovered during the time period specified helps you understand if your attack surface is growing (whether intentionally or not).Why these metrics matterModern attack surface management tools like Intruder measure what matters most. They help provide reports for stakeholders and compliance with vulnerabilities prioritized and integrations with your issue tracking tools. You can see what's vulnerable and get the exact priorities, remedies, insights, and automation you need to manage your cyber risk. If you want to see Intruder in action you can request a demo or try it for free for 14 days.",marketing,vulnerability reports,FALSE
Exposed Docker APIs Under Attack in 'Commando Cat' Cryptojacking Campaign,"Exposed Docker API endpoints over the internet are under assault from a sophisticated cryptojacking campaign called Commando Cat.""The campaign deploys a benign container generated using the Commando project,"" Cado security researchers Nate Bill and Matt Muir said in a new report published today. ""The attacker escapes this container and runs multiple payloads on the Docker host.""The campaign is believed to have been active since the start of 2024, making it the second such campaign to be discovered in as many months. In mid-January, the cloud security firm also shed light on another activity cluster that targets vulnerable Docker hosts to deploy XMRig cryptocurrency miner as well as the 9Hits Viewer software.Commando Cat employs Docker as an initial access vector to deliver a collection of interdependent payloads from an actor-controlled server that is responsible for registering persistence, backdooring the host, exfiltrating cloud service provider (CSP) credentials, and launching the miner.The foothold obtained by breaching susceptible Docker instances is subsequently abused to deploy a harmless container using the Commando open-source tool and execute a malicious command that allows it to escape the confines of the container via the chroot command.It also runs a series of checks to determine if services named ""sys-kernel-debugger,"" ""gsc,"" ""c3pool_miner,"" and ""dockercache"" are active on the compromised system, and proceeds to the next stage only if this step passes.""The purpose of the check for sys-kernel-debugger is unclear â€“ this service is not used anywhere in the malware, nor is it part of Linux,"" the researchers said. ""It is possible that the service is part of another campaign that the attacker does not want to compete with.""The succeeding phase entails dropping additional payloads from the command-and-control (C2) server, including a shell script backdoor (user.sh) that's capable of adding an SSH key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file and creating a rogue user named ""games"" with an attacker-known password and including it in the /etc/sudoers file.Also delivered in a similar manner are three more shell scripts â€“ tshd.sh, gsc.sh, aws.sh â€“ which are designed to drop Tiny SHell and an improvised version of netcat called gs-netcat, and exfiltrate credentialsThe threat actors ""run a command on the cmd.cat/chattr container that retrieves the payload from their own C2 infrastructure,"" Muir told The Hacker News, noting this is achieved by using curl or wget and piping the resulting payload directly into the bash command shell.""Instead of using /tmp, [gsc.sh] also uses /dev/shm instead, which acts as a temporary file store but memory backed instead,"" the researchers said. ""It is possible that this is an evasion mechanism, as it is much more common for malware to use /tmp.""The attack culminates in the deployment of another payload that's delivered directly as a Base64-encoded script as opposed to being retrieved from the C2 server, which, in turn, drops the XMRig cryptocurrency miner but not before eliminating competing miner processes from the infected machine.The exact origins of the threat actor behind Commando Cat are currently unclear, although the shell scripts and the C2 IP address have been observed to overlap with those linked to cryptojacking groups like TeamTNT in the past, raising the possibility that it may be a copycat group.""The malware functions as a credential stealer, highly stealthy backdoor, and cryptocurrency miner all in one,"" the researchers said. ""This makes it versatile and able to extract as much value from infected machines as possible.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

In March 2023, Meta revealed that the hacking crew created fictitious personas on Facebook and Instagram to share links to rogue apps to target victims in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tibet, and China.It's also not the first time that the attackers have been observed deploying VajraRAT, which was previously documented by Chinese cybersecurity company QiAnXin in early 2022 as having been used in a campaign aimed at Pakistani government and military entities. Vajra gets its name from the Sanskrit word for thunderbolt.Qihoo 360, in its own analysis of the malware in November 2023, tied it to a threat actor it tracks under the moniker Fire Demon Snake (aka APT-C-52).Outside of Pakistan and India, Nepalese government entities have also been likely targeted via a phishing campaign that delivers a Nim-based backdoor. It has been attributed to the SideWinder group, another outfit that has been flagged as operating with Indian interests in mind.The development comes as financially motivated threat actors from Pakistan and India have been found targeting Indian Android users with a fake loan app (Moneyfine or ""com.moneyfine.fine"") as part of an extortion scam that manipulates the selfie uploaded as part of a know your customer (KYC) process to create a nude image and threatens victims to make a payment or risk getting the doctored photos distributed to their contacts.""These unknown, financially motivated threat actors make enticing promises of quick loans with minimal formalities, deliver malware to compromise their devices, and employ threats to extort money,"" Cyfirma said in an analysis late last month.It also comes amid a broader trend of people falling prey to predatory loan apps, which are known to harvest sensitive information from infected devices, and employ blackmail and harassment tactics to pressure victims into making the payments.According to a recent report published by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), teenagers from Australia, Canada, and the U.S. are increasingly targeted by financial sextortion attacks conducted by Nigeria-based cybercriminal group known as Yahoo Boys.""Nearly all of this activity is linked to West African cybercriminals known as the Yahoo Boys, who are primarily targeting English-speaking minors and young adults on Instagram, Snapchat, and Wizz,"" NCRI said.Wizz, which has since had its Android and iOS apps taken down from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, countered the NCRI report, stating it's ""not aware of any successful extortion attempts that occurred while communicating on the Wizz app.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

Volt Typhoon's botnet infected 'hundreds' of older routers,"FBI confirms it issued remote kill command to blow out Volt Typhoon's botnetDisinfects Cisco and Netgear routers to thwart Chinese crittersChina's Volt Typhoon spies infected ""hundreds"" of outdated Cisco and Netgear equipment with malware so that the devices could be instructed to break into US critical infrastructure facilities, the Justice Department has said.On Tuesday news broke that the Feds had blocked the malicious bot network that was set up on end-of-life, US-based small office/home office routers. Now more details have come out about how an FBI team infiltrated the operation and harvested crucial data before remotely wiping the KV Botnet, according to four warrants (5018, 5530, 5451 and 5432) filed by the FBI in a southern Texas court last month and released today.""China's hackers are targeting American civilian critical infrastructure, pre-positioning to cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities in the event of conflict,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. ""Volt Typhoon malware enabled China to hide as they targeted our communications, energy, transportation, and water sectors.""The Feds claim the Middle Kingdom's cyber-spies downloaded a virtual private network module to the vulnerable routers and set up an encrypted communication channel to remotely control the botnet, and potentially order the devices to carry out attacks as well as hide their activities. Specifically: Volt Typhoon used the US-based routers and IP addresses to target US critical infrastructure, we're told.- US shorts China's Volt Typhoon crew targeting America's criticals- Five Eyes and Microsoft accuse China of attacking US infrastructure again- We know nations are going after critical systems, but what happens when crims join in?- Ivanti releases patches for VPN zero-days, discloses two more high-severity vulnsThe warrants allowed law enforcement to remotely install software on the routers to search for, and then seize or copy, information about the illicit activity before wiping the malware from the compromised devices.To do this â€” and to limit the Feds' search to routers infected with the remote-control botnet malware â€” the FBI sent specific KV Botnet commands to compromised routers to collect ""non-content information about those nodes,"" according to the warrants.This includes the IP address, port numbers used by infected routers to communicate with other nodes, as well as IP addresses and ports used by each node's parent, and data on the command-and-control nodes.""A router that is not infected by the KV Botnet malware would not receive or respond to this command,"" court documents claim.The Feds, along with foreign agency partners in Five Eyes nations, first warned about this threat in May 2023.Also today, the US government's cybersecurity agency and the FBI issued an alert urging manufacturers to eliminate defects in SOHO router web management interfaces. This, according to the Feds, includes automating update capabilities, locating the web management interface on LAN-side ports only, and requiring an explicit manual override to remove security settings.

Biden veto waiting for bill to kill SEC breach report rule,"Biden will veto attempts to kill off SEC's security breach reporting rulesSenate, House can try but won't make it past the Prez, says White HouseThe Biden administration has expressed to congressional representatives its strong opposition to undoing the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) strict data breach reporting rule.In a policy statement [PDF] published yesterday by Biden's Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the administration said it ""strongly opposes"" Senate Joint Resolution 50, introduced in November by Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC). The joint resolution, along with House Joint Resolution 100, sponsored by Representative Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) and introduced the same day, would nullify the SEC rules adopted in July of last year.The SEC's rule require public companies hit by cybercriminals to report the incident within four days. Given that the SEC's primary concern is protecting investors, the body is mostly concerned with breaches that could have a ""material"" effect on a company's bottom line, and thus present a risk to shareholders.""The lack of transparency by public companies about cyber incidents impacting their operations and data is fueling increasing cyberattacks across all sectors and all industries,"" the Biden OMB said in its objection to the Senate bill. ""Greater transparency about cyber incidents, as required in the SEC's rule, will incentivize corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity and cyber risk management.""""If the president were presented with S.J. Res. 50, he would veto it,"" OMB said.Undoing any breach reporting requirement seems antithetical to the work a Senator ought to be doing; we asked Tillis's office to explain his reasoning, but didn't hear back.Garbarino, on the other hand, issued a statement in November after submitting his companion resolution in the House that makes his position on the matter clear: Breach reporting requirements are the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) job.""This cybersecurity disclosure rule is a complete overreach on the part of the SEC and one that is in direct conflict with congressional intent,"" Garbarino said in the November release. ""CISA, as the lead civilian cybersecurity agency, has been tasked with developing and issuing regulations for cyber incident reporting as it relates to covered entities.""Garbarino said Congress and the Biden administration are on the same page with regards to harmonizing cybersecurity reporting requirements (though that doesn't appear to be the case based on the OMB policy statement). He also said the SEC was simply creating duplicative requirements that ""further burden an understaffed cybersecurity workforce with additional and unnecessary reporting requirements.""Part of those concerns may stem from the public nature of SEC incident reports, which have to be submitted on SEC Form 8-K, the contents of which are public. Disclosures must include the scope, timing, and nature of the incident, though disclosure may be delayed if the US Attorney General determines doing so would pose a risk to national security or public safety.Tillis, in a brief comment on Garbarino's release, only described the SEC's reporting rule as Commission chair Gary Gensler doing his best ""to hurt market participants by overregulating firms into oblivion,"" with an onerous rule ""that creates unrealistic timelines and unnecessary red tape that will ultimately make markets less safe overall.""- SolarWinds slams SEC lawsuit against it as 'unprecedented' victim blaming- Future of America's Cyber Safety Review Board hangs in balance amid calls for rethink- Regulator, insurers and customers all coming for Progress after MOVEit breach- US State Dept has no idea if its IT security actually works, say auditorsIt's not clear what the Senator and Congressman think of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) 30-day breach reporting requirement passed in October, which isn't mentioned in the earlier statement or resolutions.Someone has to do somethingDespite Garbarino's professed belief that CISA is the one that should be handling breach reporting requirements, the agency has yet to pass any rules that would do so.President Biden signed the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) into law in March 2022, but CISA had 24 months from passage (March 2024) to present a rule for consideration, which it has yet to do. When CISA's reporting requirements eventually go into effect, the disclosure window will be even smaller than the SEC's. CIRCIA asked CISA to give cybersecurity incident victims a mere 72 hours â€“ three days â€“ to report a breach.In the meantime, the FTC and SEC have taken matters into their own hands, which appears to be helping â€“ we've even been able to report on breaches at companies like HPE thanks to SEC reports.As previously reported, the number of victims paying ransomware operators has fallen to 29 percent. The company behind that statistic, ransomware negotiation firm Coveware, attributes much of the decrease in ransom payments in recent months to reporting requirements from the SEC and FTC.Those payments are down despite what the White House OMB said was a 45 percent increase in ransomware attacks year-over-year.""Reversing the SEC's rulemaking would not only disadvantage investors â€¦ but would also cause companies to undervalue investments in cyber programs to the detriment of our economic and national security,"" the OMB said.Then again, maybe giving the SEC cybersecurity reporting authority isn't the best move â€“ after all, the agency can't even keep its Twitter account secure.

Google throws $1M at Rust Foundation to build C++ bridges,"Chocolate Factory matches Microsoft money for memory safetyGoogle on Monday donated $1 million to the Rust Foundation specifically to improve interoperability between the language and C++.C++, a popular general purpose programming language, has arguably fallen out of fashion due to concerns over safety. Memory safety errors are the source of the majority of vulnerabilities for Google and Microsoft, and this has led to evangelism for memory-safe Rust and a scarlet letter for C/C++.""Based on historical vulnerability density statistics, Rust has proactively prevented hundreds of vulnerabilities from impacting the Android ecosystem,"" said Dave Kleidermacher, Google VP of engineering, Android security and privacy, in a statement. ""This investment aims to expand the adoption of Rust across various components of the platform.""Thanks to endorsements by industry figures like Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich, and from public sector figures like CISA director Jen Easterly, not to mention industry efforts like ISRG's Prossimo, there's pressure on software developers to consider Rust and other memory-safe languages where suitable.Lars Bergstrom, director of Android platform tools and libraries and chair of the Rust Foundation Board, announced the grant and said that the funding will ""improve the ability of Rust code to interoperate with existing legacy C++ codebases.""Bergstrom told The Register that interoperability with C++ represents one of the biggest obstacles to broader adoption of Rust for Google and other organizations.""This is the most common hurdle all organizations have to overcome to increase their implementation of Rust,"" he said. ""Many existing legacy code bases, as well as core libraries and services, are either written in C++ or only have APIs available in C++, Java, Go, or Python. Integrating Rust today is possible where there is a fallback C API, but for high-performance and high-fidelity interoperability, improving the ability to work directly with C++ code is the single biggest initiative that will further the ability to adopt Rust.""- Microsoft seeks Rust developers to rewrite core C# code- Dump C++ and in Rust you should trust, Five Eyes agencies urge- Rusty revenant Servo returns to render once more- Google Go language goes with opt-in telemetryGoogle's Chromium project consists largely of C++ code, and Android uses the language too, alongside Java and others.According to Bergstrom, Google's most significant increase in the use of Rust has occurred in Android, where interoperability started receiving attention in 2021, although Rust is also being deployed elsewhere.""We also have a team working on building out interoperability,"" he added. ""We hope that this teamâ€™s work on addressing challenges specific to Googleâ€™s codebases will complement the industry-wide investments from this new grant weâ€™ve provided to the Rust Foundation.""Google's grant matches a $1 million grant last November from Microsoft, which also committed $10 million in internal investment to make Rust a ""first-class language in our engineering systems."" The Google-bucks are expected to fund further interoperability efforts, along the lines of KDAB's bidirectional Rust and C++ bindings with Qt.Rebecca Rumbul, executive director and CEO of the Rust Foundation said in a statement that while Rust offers technical advantages, it's unrealistic to expect organizations to abandon existing codebases. The Rust Foundation has also created a new Interop Initiative to make it more simpleto integrate Rust into existing C++ projects and workflows.

That said, the issues have been addressed in runC version 1.1.12 released today following responsible disclosure in November 2023.

Deepfakes mean biometric security measures won't be enough,"Rise of deepfake threats means biometric security measures won't be enoughDefenses need a rethink in face of increasing sophisticationCyber attacks using AI-generated deepfakes to bypass facial biometrics security will lead a third of organizations to doubt the adequacy of identity verification and authentication tools as standalone protections.Or so says consultancy and market watcher Gartner, as deepfakes dominate the news since sexually explicit AI-generated viral images of popstar Taylor Swift prompted fans, Microsoft, and the White House to call for action.However, the relentless march of AI technology can also be the cause of headaches for enterprise security. Remote account recovery, for example, might rely on an image of the individual's face to unlock security. But since these could be beaten by images copied from social media and other sources, security systems employed ""liveness detection"" to see if the request was from the right individual.As well as matching an individual's image to the one on record, systems relying on liveness detection also try to test if they are really there through an ""active"" request such as a head movement or ""passive"" sensing of micro facial movements and the focus of the eyes.Yet these approaches could now be duped by AI deepfakes and need to be supplemented by additional layers of security, Gartner's VP Analyst Akif Khan told The Register.He said that defense against the new threat can come from supplementing existing measures or improving on them.""Let's say, for example, the vendor knows that an IP verification process shows the user is running an iPhone 13 and understands the camera resolution of the device, then if the [presented deepfake doesn't match these parameters] it might suggest that it's been digitally injected,"" he said.- Dems and Repubs agree on something â€“ a law to tackle unauthorized NSFW deepfakes- 'I'm sorry for everything...' Facebook's Zuck apologizes to families at Senate hearing- It took Taylor Swift deepfake nudes to focus Uncle Sam, Microsoft on AI safety- AI political disinformation is a huge problem â€“ but harder to fight than everOther examples of supplementary security might include looking at device location or frequency of requests from the same device, he said.Security system developers are also trying to use AI â€“ typically deep neural networks â€“ to inspect the presented images to look for signs that they are deepfakes. ""One vendor showed me an example of several deepfake images that they had detected, and the faces looked very different,"" Khan told us.""However, when you really zoomed in there were on each of the heads three or four hairs, which were all in the absolute exact same kind of configuration of like three or four hairs overlapping with each other in a way that just looked eerily identical across these like three or four different people. That was like an artifact that they use to determine that actually these are synthetically created images.""Organizations should use both approaches to defend against deepfake threats to biometric security, he said.""It's classic defense-in-depth security.

Data in apps used for aircraft safety remotely tampered with,"Researchers remotely exploit devices used to manage safe aircraft landings and takeoffsThe closest thing we may ever get to a real-life Die Hard 2 scenarioCriminals could remotely tamper with the data that apps used by airplane pilots rely on to inform safe takeoff and landing procedures, according to fresh research.In a scenario that elicits strong memories of that nail-biting flight scene from Die Hard 2, researchers investigating electronic flight bags (EFBs) found the app used by Airbus pilots was vulnerable to remote data manipulation, given the right conditions.In reality, that Die Hard scene was, surprise surprise, riddled with plot holes â€“ the researchers proved that a few months ago â€“ but proving the possibility of something similar would always be exciting.An EFB is usually a tablet or tablet-like portable computer that runs aviation-specific apps used for a variety of flight deck or cabin tasks, such as making calculations to improve aircraft performance.The vulnerability was found in Flysmart+ Manager, one of many apps within the Flysmart+ suite used by Airbus pilots to synchronize data to other Flysmart+ apps which provide data to pilots informing safe takeoffs and landings.Developed by Airbus-owned NAVBLUE, Flysmart+ Manager was found to have disabled app transport security (ATS), by setting the NSAllowsArbitraryLoads property list key to ""true."" ATS is a key security control responsible for securing communications between the app and the app's update server.""ATS is a security mechanism that forces the application to use HTTPS, preventing unencrypted communications,"" blogged Antonio Cassidy, partner at Pen Test Partners, who carried out the research. ""An attacker could use this weakness to intercept and decrypt potentially sensitive information in transit.""A feasible attack would have to involve the interception of data flowing to the app, and a number of very specific conditions would need to be met. Even Ken Munro, another partner at Pen Test Partners, admitted exploitation would be unlikely in a real-world scenario.Oh, yes that hotel the airline always uses....First, an attacker would need to be within Wi-Fi range of the EFB loaded with Flysmart+ Manager. Sounds unlikely, but Munro said airlines often use the same hotels to accommodate their pilots between flights, and you can spot them, and the airline they work for, fairly easily.Secondly, and perhaps the biggest blockade to realistic exploitability, is the fact that an attacker would need to be monitoring the device's traffic at the time of the EFB handler initiating an app update.The update cycle is determined by the Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control (AIRAC) database. The AIRAC database can be updated with important information such as when new runways are installed or made temporarily unavailable, or when significant changes are made to the runway environment, like the installation of a crane.When the database is updated with new data, the app must download it to provide pilots with accurate and timely information. This is typically done once a month.The attack scenario devised by the researchers involved targeting a pilot sitting at a hotel bar â€“ so, within Wi-Fi range â€“ and performing directional Wi-Fi hunting while targeting a specific endpoint that the attacker would be aware of as they know the target app.""Given that airlines typically use the same hotel for pilots who are down route / on a layover, an attacker could target the hotel's Wi-Fi networks with the goal of modifying aircraft performance data,"" said Cassidy.In developing a proof-of-concept for an exploit, the researchers were able to access data being downloaded from update servers. Most of it came in the form of SQLite databases, with some including weight balance data of an aircraft and the minimum equipment list â€“ information on what systems can be inoperative for a flight.Cassidy said the possible consequences of a successful exploit could include an airplane tailstrike or a failed takeoff, leading to runway excursions.""Do I think this is likely? No, absolutely not,"" said Munro. ""But, the point is there is a vulnerability. There are issues with flight systems and the good news is we're finding them and manufacturers are fixing it.""- Tablet computer zoom error saw plane fly 13 hours with 46cm hole- YouTuber who crashed plane for sponsorship dollars earns 6 months behind bars- If anyone finds an $80M F-35 stealth fighter, please call the Pentagon- Pilots get electronic flight bagAirbus was commended by the researchers for fixing the issue within 19 months, which is in the expected range for aviation tech, they said.A window of 19 months would be entirely unacceptable in regular IT patching, but in aviation, an update like this would typically take around 12 months, so not a million miles away. A longer period of time is required for it to go through certification processes with the aviation industry, we're told.Munro said: ""Could that be a bit quicker? Yeah, I think it could have been a bit quicker, but they fixed it â€“ that's the important thing, and it was done in a reasonable amount of time for aviation software.""One active commercial pilot told The Register the finding was a ""concern,"" particularly with regard to takeoff performance speeds since the Airbus performance program is known for producing different speeds and flap settings to optimize takeoffs. They said because of this frequent change, a pilot probably wouldn't spot a manipulated dataset if it appeared in the EFB app, which could lead to dangerous takeoff procedures.Some airlines have gross error checks that examine the relationship between the calculated speed and actual aircraft speed, based on the aircraft's weight and balance data, the type which was accessed by the researchers while looking into Flysmart+ Manager.""I assume [these checks] would pick up a hackâ€¦ but I couldn't say that categorically,"" the pilot said.Responding to the research, an Airbus spokesperson said: ""We identified a potential vulnerability in a specific version of the NAVBLUE FlySmart+ EFB product in 2022.""Our analysis, confirmed by EASA, showed that there was no safety issue thanks to the security procedures in place to validate flight-relevant data.

Others say ultrasound systems were down and prescriptions were being handled using analog, pen-and-paper methods.Lurie Children's Hospital said in a statement: ""As Illinois' leading provider for pediatric care, our overarching priority is to continue providing safe, quality care to our patients and the communities we serve. Lurie Children's is open and providing care to patients with as limited disruption as possible.""We are very grateful to our workforce and care providers who are committed to preserving our charitable mission during this time. We recognize the concern and inconvenience the systems outage may cause our patient-families and community providers and are working diligently to resolve this matter as quickly and effectively as possible.""The hospital treats more than 200,000 children a year and is home to the Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute, which is actively researching a range of pediatric illnesses and injuries.Attribution for the attack hasn't been made, nor has any ransomware or other cybercrime group claimed responsibility for it.The incident closely follows another attack at Saint Anthony Hospital, based just 8km (five miles) from Lurie, with the ""credit"" swiftly claimed by the LockBit ransomware gang.The attack on Saint Anthony's system began in December 2023 and the hospital only recently disclosed the extent of the damage â€“ data theft but little to no operational downtime or disruption.It appears the hospital didn't pay the ransom and the stolen data has been published by LockBit, which is entirely unsurprising given the $800,000 ransom the gang set. Even if Saint Anthony Hospital were inclined to pay, which is very much not the officially recommended route to take, given the lofty sum and the fact it's a non-profit, it's unlikely the hospital would be able to pay anyway.The healthcare sector has long been a primary target for cybercriminals for many reasons, from generally poorer security postures to the operational disruption an attack on a hospital or similar facility can cause, and everything in between.- Alert: This ransomware preys on healthcare orgs via weak-ass VPN servers- Interpol's latest cybercrime intervention dismantles ransomware, banking malware servers- LockBit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children's hospital- Ransomware payment rates drop to new low â€“ now 'only 29% of victims' fork over cashWhen critical services like these are floored, the chances of making a speedy payment to restore access to key systems is, in theory, more likely than a corporate company that has more time to think about a response strategy.However, according to new rules reportedly set for imminent approval, US hospitals will have to meet certain cybersecurity standards to receive federal funding in a move the government will hope stems the tide on ransomware's targeting of hospitals.During El Reg's investigation, we were pointed to a December concept paper from the US Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) cybersecurity strategy. The paper included proposals for enforcing new standards that if met, would offer financial support and incentives for hospitals.

Twin Max-Severity Bugs Open Fortinet's SIEM to Code Execution,"February 6, 2024Two critical vulnerabilities in Fortinet's FortiSIEM product have been assigned provisional CVSS scores of 10. However, details about the bugs remain scant.What is known is that the vulnerabilities, tracked under CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109, are command injection flaws that could potentially let threat actors use crafted API requests to execute unauthorized code.FortiSIEM is Fortinet's security information and event management (SIEM) platform, used for enabling enterprise cybersecurity operations centers.FortiSIEM versions impacted by the flaws include version 7.1.0 through 7.1.1; 7.0.0 through 7.0.2; 6.7.0 through 6.7.8; 6.6.0 through 6.6.3; 6.5.0 through 6.5.2; and 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, according to the CVE entries.The link Fortinet provided for information on the flaws leads to a write-up on another FortiSIEM vulnerability from October 2023, suggesting there might be a link between that bug and these new discoveries. The previous flaw was assigned a CVSS score of 9.7.Dark Reading asked Fortinet for additional details but has not yet received a response.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",vulnerability reports,vulnerability reports,TRUE
Akira and 8Base are the ransomware gangs to watch in 2024,"New kids on the ransomware block in 2023: Akira and 8Base lead dozens of newbiesHow good are your takedowns when fresh gangs are linked to previous ops, though?At least 25 new ransomware gangs emerged in 2023, with Akira and 8Base proving the most ""successful,"" research reveals.The gangs were the two ""success"" stories of the year for cybercrooks, proving that the lure of big ransom payouts is still enough to attract significant interest from fledgling ransomware operations, despite the challenges that remain for newcomers.For one thing, there's more and more attention from law enforcement agencies, which shut down numerous operations last year, for example, and this threatens to be a serious deterrent for this year's shenanigans.The high degree of competition between gangs was also listed as another reason for some groups dropping off the scene, according to researchers at Unit 42 by Palo Alto Networks. Cybercriminals must offer competitive payouts to affiliates while also offering a ransomware payload that's effective enough to attract capable criminals to their program and away from powerful competitors like LockBit and ALPHV/BlackCat.Get your hankies ready â€“ some gangs didn't make it...The difficulties facing ransomware groups may explain why so many failed to survive last year. Five of the 25 newcomers didn't make it to see their first birthday, failing to register a single attack in the final six months of the year.- Is critical infrastructure prepared for OT ransomware?- Akira ransomware gang says it stole passport scans from Lush in 110 GB data heist- US readies prison cell for another Russian Trickbot developer- Analysis of leaked Conti files blows lid off ransomware gang""A lack of leak site posts does not necessarily mean these groups have ceased operations. Criminals from these groups could have moved to other types of operations, retreated from public view, or merged with other ransomware groups,"" blogged Doel Santos, principal threat researcher at Unit 42.""If some of these groups did not last the entire year, new threat actors can fill the void. The second half of 2023 revealed posts from 12 new leak sites, indicating these groups might have started later in the year.""Of the 25 new gangs identified by Unit 42, at least 12 of them are connected to pre-existing groups either as offshoots or as suspected rebrands of operations that closed down.The full list of the new gangs from 2023 is below, including details about whether they are still active and where relevant, what other gang they're supposedly connected to.-8Base (linked to Phobos)-Abyss-Akira (linked to Conti)-BlackSuit (linked to Conti)-Cactus-CiphBit-Cloak (linked to ARCrypter)-(Inactive) CrossLock-(Inactive) CryptNet (linked to Chaos)-Cyclops-(Inactive) DarkRace (linked to LockBit)-Hunters International-INC-Knight (Cyclops)-LostTrust (MetaEncryptor)-NoEscape (linked to Avaddon)-Meow-Money Message-RA Group (linked to Babuk)-(Inactive) Rancoz-(Inactive) Ransomed.vc-Rhysida (linked to Vice Society)-ThreeAM-Trigona (linked to Crylock)-U-BombThe 25 new ransomware operations accounted for roughly a quarter of all publicly claimed ransomware incidents in 2023.We say ""publicly claimed"" because the number of actual ransomware attacks is likely to be much higher, but due to poor disclosure or paying ransoms early, we'll never get to learn about them.Out of all the newcomers, Akira is thought to be the fastest-growing of the bunch and has so far claimed a number of major attacks, such as cosmetics giant Lush in just the past few weeks.According to BlackFog's analysis [PDF] of January 2024's ransomware incidents, Akira laid claim to roughly 12 percent of them, making it the second-most active group of the year so far. It's hardly unsurprising if Conti is indeed behind the operation â€“ Conti at the height of its powers was the most feared group of its timeâ€¦ before it imploded, of course.That said, Wizard Spider, the heavily sanctioned gang behind Ryuk, Conti, Trickbot, and others remains (mostly) at large thanks to Russia's blind-eye approach to cybercriminals' behavior, as long as all the nastiness is directed to the West.8Base is a group that was technically established in 2022, Santos said, but given that its leak blog didn't go live until May 2023, it's being lumped together with last year's newbies.It started the year strongly, consistently registering more attacks than Akira, and although the latter eventually overtook 8Base by the end of the year, Unit 42's figures showed very little difference in the final numbers, suggesting it was just as effective as Akira.The two gangs were the standout ""performers"" of the 25 new operations last year and, while it wasn't included in Unit42's list, the Russian-language WereWolves group which rapidly rose to prominence towards the very end of the year looks as though it will continue to make a mark this year.All groups will also be looking to sweep up the market share left behind by the groups that fell last year, in large part due to the work of international law enforcement agencies.Hive, Ragnar Locker, Ransomed.vc, and Trigona were all shuttered by law enforcement last year, and authorities nearly got hold of ALPHV too but the group managed to wrestle back control during a multi-day struggle with the FBI.The takedowns were celebrated at the time but as industry pros wound down for their Christmas holidays, the debate around ransomware payments heated up and ultimately watered down the significance of the authorities' efforts.",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
How Neurodiversity Can Help Fill the Cybersecurity Workforce Shortage,"February 6, 2024COMMENTARYOne of the most vexing issues in cybersecurity doesn't have to do with technology; it has to do with people. Finding enough cybersecurity professionals to fill open positions in the public and private sectors has been a problem for more than a decade, and, despite efforts from both sectors, the situation has not improved. The most recent (2022) report from ISC2 puts the US cyber workforce gap at 410,695 â€” up 9% from the 2021 report. ISC2 says the global gap is 3.4 million, noting that the supply of cybersecurity workers cannot keep up with the demand. The global workforce gap increased by over 25% from 2021 to 2022, and nearly 70% of the cyber professionals surveyed for the ISC2 report said their organization has a worker shortage.One ISC2 recommendation for filling the gap is to recruit a more diverse population, as cybersecurity work requires a variety of skills at a variety of levels, and a good portion of the work comes down to problem-solving. Having a diverse workforce generates different perspectives and ways to solve problems, adding important dimensions to the cyber skill set.While many companies are focusing on important diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts around race and gender, many of the top science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) companies, such as Microsoft, SAP, and EY, are looking to increase neurodiversity in their workforce. Neurodiversity describes the natural variation in human brains that leads to differences in the way we think, learn, and work. While neurodiversity hiring programs originally focused on autism, many employers have expanded their recruitment to include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, and other (sometimes nonlabeled) differences that bring a new perspective to their workforce.Neurodiversity as a Competitive AdvantageResearch in psychology and neuroscience points to several assets that neurodivergent people may bring to the workforce. Some people with autism excel in detailed pattern recognition and systematic thinking â€” talents that software companies have leveraged in areas such as quality assurance and debugging. These skills are remarkably well-suited for cybersecurity tasks such as monitoring and detecting security breaches.ADHD and dyslexia are associated with increased idea generation and the ability to see connections between new ideas. In addition, employers have found the nonconformity and innovative thinking that people with ADHD or dyslexia bring to the workforce valuable for approaching problems in new and different ways. Employers also appreciate the persistence and focus many of their neurodivergent employees demonstrate, which leads to thorough problem-solving and follow through. Many STEM employers say that neurodiversity in their workforce is a competitive advantage.How to Recruit Neurodiverse TalentOne problem these companies face is not finding enough neurodivergent talent. Unfortunately, many of our best learners are discouraged from STEM through schooling that focuses on their deficits rather than their talents. Many brilliant problem solvers leave school thinking they are intellectually unfit for any professional career, let alone cybersecurity.This is why we must start looking at neurodiversity differently in our education systems. We must engage learners in student-centered learning, where their own interests and talents guide the learning process. When this happens, each learner can discover their own strengths and work from those. When they feel confident and strong as learners, their deficits can also be addressed. But if we make them feel like losers from the start, we've given up on them before they can play the game.My research shows that companies that have successful neurodiversity workforce programs have changed the way they recruit, interview, hire, and manage their employees.Placing more emphasis on performance than on communications.Providing opportunities for employees to work and express themselves in different ways, not always adhering to one cultural norm.Encouraging managers to foster clear guidelines and expectations, with meeting agendas prepared in advance and meetings documented clearly afterwards, so that nothing gets missed or misinterpreted.Doing work in teams where each person can work to their strengths, contributing where they are best suited, and relying on others for areas where they struggle.Not surprisingly, many companies find that the accommodations they make for neurodivergent learners are what all their employees see as good management. Everyone benefits from the new ways of working.The need for cybersecurity professionals will expand as artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies come online. Meeting these needs will require an innovative, creative, persistent workforce with a keen eye for detail and systematic thinking. These folks are out there. They are in our classrooms today. Educators and cybersecurity companies just need to reach them where they are and give them a chance.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE
Akamai Announces Content Protector to Stop Scraping Attacks,"February 6, 2024PRESS RELEASECAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced the availability of Content Protector, a product that stops scraping attacks without blocking the good traffic that companies need to enhance their business.Scraper bots are a critical and often productive part of the commerce ecosystem. These bots search for new content, highlight products in comparison sites, and gather updated product information to share with customers. Unfortunately, scrapers also get used for harmful purposes such as competitive undercutting, surveillance before inventory hoarding attacks, and counterfeiting goods and websites. Scrapers also ping sites 24/7 unless stopped â€” so they can degrade site performance, which in turn frustrates consumers and causes them to abandon their visits. In addition, scrapers have become much more evasive and sophisticated over the past few years.Akamai Content Protector helps detect and mitigate evasive scrapers that steal content for malicious purposes. It enables improved site performance, an enhanced user experience and protection of intellectual property while facilitating significantly better detections and fewer false negatives without increasing the rate of false positives. The product is designed for companies that need to protect their reputation and revenue potential. It offers tailored detections that include:Protocol-level assessment: Protocol fingerprinting checks how visitors connect to your site to ensure they're legitimate. It evaluates how the client establishes the connection with the server at the different layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model â€” verifying that the parameters negotiated align with the one expected from the most common web browsers and mobile applications.Application-level assessment: Evaluates if the client can run some business logic written in JavaScript. When the client runs JavaScript, it collects the device and browser characteristics and user preferences. These various data points are compared and cross-checked against the protocol-level data to verify consistency.User interaction: Analyzes user interactions to distinguish between human and bot traffic. It assesses how users interact with devices such as touch screens, keyboards, and mouse, identifying bots through their lack of interaction or abnormal usage patterns.User behavior: Monitors visitor behavior on your website to identify unusual patterns indicative of bots.Risk classification: Provides a deterministic and actionable low-, medium-, or high-risk classification of the traffic, based on the anomalies found during the evaluation.""Content Protector is more than just a security tool; it's a business enabler,"" says Rupesh Chokshi, SVP and GM, Application Security at Akamai. ""By safeguarding your digital assets from scraping threats, it prevents competitors from undercutting your offers, enhances site performance to keep customers engaged, and protects your brand from counterfeiters. Content Protector provides direct business value to grow your digital business with confidence.""About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

Beware: Fake Facebook Job Ads Spreading 'Ov3r_Stealer' to Steal Crypto and Credentials,"Threat actors are leveraging bogus Facebook job advertisements as a lure to trick prospective targets into installing a new Windows-based stealer malware codenamed Ov3r_Stealer.""This malware is designed to steal credentials and crypto wallets and send those to a Telegram channel that the threat actor monitors,"" Trustwave SpiderLabs said in a report shared with The Hacker News.Ov3r_Stealer is capable of siphoning IP address-based location, hardware info, passwords, cookies, credit card information, auto-fills, browser extensions, crypto wallets, Microsoft Office documents, and a list of antivirus products installed on the compromised host.While the exact end goal of the campaign is unknown, it's likely that the stolen information is offered for sale to other threat actors. Another possibility is that Ov3r_Stealer could be updated over time to act as a QakBot-like loader for additional payloads, including ransomware.The starting point of the attack is a weaponized PDF file that purports to be a file hosted on OneDrive, urging users to click on an ""Access Document"" button embedded into it.Trustwave said it identified the PDF file being shared on a fake Facebook account impersonating Amazon CEO Andy Jassy as well as via Facebook ads for digital advertising jobs.Users who end up clicking on the button are served an internet shortcut (.URL) file that masquerades as a DocuSign document hosted on Discord's content delivery network (CDN). The shortcut file then acts as a conduit to deliver a control panel item (.CPL) file, which is then executed using the Windows Control Panel process binary (""control.exe"").The execution of the CPL file leads to the retrieval of a PowerShell loader (""DATA1.txt"") from a GitHub repository to ultimately launch Ov3r_Stealer.It's worth noting at this stage that a near-identical infection chain was recently disclosed by Trend Micro as having put to use by threat actors to drop another stealer called Phemedrone Stealer by exploiting the Microsoft Windows Defender SmartScreen bypass flaw (CVE-2023-36025, CVSS score: 8.8).The similarities extend to the GitHub repository used (nateeintanan2527) and the fact that Ov3r_Stealer shares code-level overlaps with Phemedrone.""This malware has recently been reported, and it may be that Phemedrone was re-purposed and renamed to Ov3r_Stealer,"" Trustwave said. ""The main difference between the two is that Phemedrone is written in C#.""Further solidifying the connections between the two stealer malware, the threat actor has been observed sharing news reports published about the Phemedrone Stealer on their Telegram channels in an effort to build ""street cred"" for their malware-as-a-service (MaaS) business.""My custom stealer is on the new[s], showing how evasive it is, im [sic] the developer of it, so happy now,"" the threat actor, who goes by the online alias Liu Kong said, while also expressing frustration at the fact that threat hunters managed to ""reverse the whole exploit chain"" despite everything being ""on memory.""The findings come as Hudson Rock revealed that threat actors are advertising their access to law enforcement request portals of major organizations like Binance, Google, Meta, and TikTok by exploiting credentials obtained from infostealer infections.They also follow the emergence of a category of infections called CrackedCantil that leverage cracked software as an initial access vector to drop loaders like PrivateLoader and SmokeLoader, when subsequently act as a delivery mechanism for information stealers, crypto miners, proxy botnets, and ransomware.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Verizon says 63K employee info wrongly accessed by insider,"Verizon says 63K employees' info fell into the wrong hands â€“ an insider this timeTelco says it's a private matter, data 'not shared externally'Verizon is notifying more than 63,000 people, mostly current employees, that an insider, accidentally or otherwise, had inappropriate access to their personal data.The privacy blunder happened in September, and the American telco giant attributed it to ""inadvertent disclosure"" and ""insider wrongdoing"" in documents submitted to the Maine Attorney General. The Pine Tree state's strict data loss rules require security snafu disclosures, even though in this case only 82 of its residents were directly affected.At the heart of the drama: A Verizon employee apparently obtained a file that they shouldn't have had access to, containing personal information including: names, addresses, Social Security numbers or other national identifiers, gender, union affiliation (if applicable), dates of birth, and compensation information.Of the 63,206 people to receive privacy breach notifications [PDF], ""the vast majority of the impacted are current Verizon employees,"" spokesperson Rich Young told The Register. There are some former Verizon employees included who they will be notified and offered the same [identity protection] services as current team members.""An internal review of the error remains ongoing, though as of now it does not appear to be a rogue insider intent on selling coworker info on criminal marketplaces, we're told.""There is no indication of malicious intent nor do we believe the information was shared externally,"" Verizon's Young said.When asked what, if anything, happened to the employee behind the inadvertent disclosure, Young added: ""We're not going to discuss any employee involved as these are private, personnel matters.""- Verizon prepaid accounts hijacked by SIM swap crooks- EquiLend back in the saddle as ransom payment rumors swirl- Double trouble for Fortinet customers as pair of critical vulns found in FortiSIEM- Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security holeIn light of the snafu, Verizon tells us it is boosting its technical controls to prevent future unauthorized file access. The cellular giant is also offering affected individuals two years of free credit monitoring and identity protection services and if fraud occurs, they can receive up to $1 million in reimbursement for stolen funds and expenses.Verizon's most recent security snafu happened back in October 2022 when some of its prepaid customers' accounts were compromised by crooks attempting to hijack their phone numbers via SIM swapping methods.""Between October 6 and October 10, 2022, a third party actor accessed the last four digits of the credit card used to make automatic payments on your account,"" the mobile network operator said at the time.From there, the criminals attempted to transfer the victims' phone numbers to other devices, which would allow the fraudsters to access one-time security codes and then break into the victims' banking apps and other online accounts.

JetBrains issues urgent patches for critical TeamCity vuln,"JetBrains urges swift patching of latest critical TeamCity flawCloud version is safe, but no assurances offered about possible on-prem exploitsJetBrains is encouraging all users of TeamCity (on-prem) to upgrade to the latest version following the disclosure of a critical vulnerability in the CI/CD tool.Tracked as CVE-2024-23917, the vulnerability has been assigned a provisional 9.8 CVSS score and allows unauthenticated remote attackers to take over vulnerable servers with admin privileges.""All versions from 2017.1 through 2023.11.2 are affected by this issue,"" Daniel Gallo, solutions engineer at JetBrains, said in an advisory. ""The issue has been patched in 2023.11.3. We recommend upgrading as soon as possible.""The vulnerability only requires attention for admins of on-prem servers since TeamCity Cloud has already been patched. JetBrains also confirmed that no attacks had been detected against TeamCity Cloud, but made no such assertions about the on-prem product.Patching can be carried out by downloading the latest version, using the automatic update feature within TeamCity itself, or by using the security patch plugin which addresses CVE-2024-23917 only.JetBrains said it's always best to just upgrade the whole server â€“ as users will then receive all the other security fixes that come with it â€“ rather than just patching the single vulnerability.- The spyware business is booming despite government crackdowns- Chinese Coathanger malware hung out to dry by Dutch defense department- Double trouble for Fortinet customers as pair of critical vulns found in FortiSIEM- Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security holeIf, for whatever reason, any of the patches or mitigations can't be applied immediately, it's recommended that public-facing TeamCity servers should be made inaccessible until the critical flaw is addressed.The disclosure comes just a few months after it was revealed that state-sponsored attackers from Russia and North Korea were separately targeting TeamCity servers vulnerable to a similar flaw announced in September.CVE-2023-42793 also registered a 9.8 severity score and activity from foreign offensive cyber units prompted leading Western authorities to issue an advisory, urging swift patching.There was no evidence to suggest the access the attackers had was used to lay the groundwork for a SolarWinds-like attack, which is always the fear when there are reports of CI/CD compromises.Instead, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) exploited the vulnerability to move laterally around victim's networks and plant backdoors to facilitate follow-on attacks.The SVR used the GraphicalProton backdoor in attacks driven by an MO that doesn't appear to have changed much in the past ten years.

Critical Boot Loader Vulnerability in Shim Impacts Nearly All Linux Distros,"The maintainers of shim have released version 15.8 to address six security flaws, including a critical bug that could pave the way for remote code execution under specific circumstances.Tracked as CVE-2023-40547 (CVSS score: 9.8), the vulnerability could be exploited to achieve a Secure Boot bypass. Bill Demirkapi of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug.""The shim's http boot support (httpboot.c) trusts attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response, leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive,"" Oracle's Alan Coopersmith noted in a message shared on the Open Source Security mailing list oss-security.Demirkapi, in a post shared on X (formerly Twitter) late last month, said the vulnerability ""exists in every Linux boot loader signed in the past decade.""Firmware security firm Eclypsium said CVE-2023-40547 ""stems from HTTP protocol handling, leading to an out-of-bounds write that can lead to complete system compromise.""In a hypothetical attack scenario, a threat actor on the same network could leverage the flaw to load a vulnerable shim boot loader, or by a local adversary with adequate privileges to manipulate data on the EFI partition.""An attacker could perform a MiTM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack and intercept HTTP traffic between the victim and the HTTP server used to serve files to support HTTP boot,"" the company added. ""The attacker could be located on any network segment between the victim and the legitimate server.""That said, obtaining the ability to execute code during the boot process â€“ which occurs before the main operating system starts â€“ grants the attacker carte blanche access to deploy stealthy bootkits that can give near-total control over the compromised host.The five other vulnerabilities fixed in shim version 15.8 are below -- CVE-2023-40546 (CVSS score: 5.3) - Out-of-bounds read when printing error messages, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition- CVE-2023-40548 (CVSS score: 7.4) - Buffer overflow in shim when compiled for 32-bit processors that can lead to a crash or data integrity issues during the boot phase- CVE-2023-40549 (CVSS score: 5.5) - Out-of-bounds read in the authenticode function that could permit an attacker to trigger a DoS by providing a malformed binary- CVE-2023-40550 (CVSS score: 5.5) - Out-of-bounds read when validating Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) information that could result in information disclosure- CVE-2023-40551 (CVSS score: 7.1) - Out-of-bounds read when parsing MZ binaries, leading to a crash or possible exposure of sensitive data""An attacker exploiting this vulnerability gains control of the system before the kernel is loaded, which means they have privileged access and the ability to circumvent any controls implemented by the kernel and operating system,"" Eclypsium noted.",security updates and patches,security updates and patches,TRUE
Managed Everything? Vendors Shift Focus to Services,"News, news analysis, and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology.Managed Everything? Vendors Shift Focus to ServicesMore companies are opting for managing complex security capabilities, such as data detection and response.February 7, 2024Threat management firm Rapid7 and data security firm Varonis announced new managed services this week, becoming the latest security companies to bundle complex security capabilities together in managed offerings.On Feb. 6, Rapid7 announced its Managed Digital Risk Protection (DRP) service. which will regularly scan the Internet and Dark Web for signs that attackers may be targeting a client's business. A day earlier, data security firm Varonis expanded its portfolio of products that monitor data access and detect potential breaches to offer a managed service to detect and respond to incidents. Varonis asserted that the service will focus on detecting potential ransomware and data breaches and responding within 30 minutes.""The way a lot of these data breaches actually happen is someone is able to compromise a regular user account, get a lot of data, and then exfiltrate that before anybody finds out,"" says Matthew Radolec, vice president of incident response and cloud operations at Varonis. ""Our entire value proposition is that we want to help ... reduce the amount of data any one person can get to and use detection and response on data to stop those problems.""Varonis coined a new name for the market segment the new service fits into: managed data detection and response (MDDR).Understanding New Market SegmentsOrganizations are increasingly consolidating their security vendors â€” in a September 2022 survey, three-quarters of companies said they have pursued vendor consolidation â€” and that is pushing vendors to differentiate themselves in the market. One way to accomplish that is by creating new market segments. For example, data loss prevention (DLP) as a segment has fragmented into data detection and response (DDR), data security posture management (DSPM), and insider risk management (IRM). Players in this market area include BigID, Cyberhaven, Dig Security, Laminar Technologies, and Sotero.Nearly every new category leads to a managed version, but one that often does not need to exist and ends up just making the cybersecurity more complex, says Jeff Pollard, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research.""We're creating a scenario for security leaders with all these various DRs [detection and response services], where, frankly, they're going to need to buy a tool per DR service,"" he says. ""Vendors that have a kind of siloed niche offering are trying to make it seem substantially more sophisticated than it is, when in reality what security leaders really need are tools, technologies, and providers that will work across the entirety of their detection surface.""Making Sense of Alphabet SoupIn many ways, managed detection and response (MDR) covers a lot of ground and, so far, has done well for vendors and their customers. Vendors have happy clients, exceptionally rapid growth rate, and a very high margin for the service, Pollard says. Meanwhile, businesses can focus on the threats, leading to faster detection and response. Focusing on the data could improve the response time, but that is far from certain.However, no matter what telemetry, data, or devices a detection and response service focuses on to detect threats, businesses just want to focus on outcomes â€” detecting threats and preventing compromises, says Eric Kokonas, vice president at Sophos.""The truth is that the best applications of MDR are the result â€” not of strict adherence to a defined set of tools, telemetry sources, and services â€” but of an adaptable range of human-led capabilities that can be delivered and consumed in ways that are most compatible with organizations' needs and that are most likely to achieve the organizations' desired outcomes,"" Kokonas says. ""Put more plainly, MDR services exist to achieve security and business outcomes the most optimal way possible.""Companies will likely adopt more managed services because security is growing more complex. Offering a managed version of an emerging security service will be an increasingly common approach, as the creation of an in-house cybersecurity capability is expensive, analyst firm Frost & Sullivan stated in its ""Global Managed Detection and Response Market"" report published in May 2022.""In light of the shortage of cybersecurity professionals, organizations are looking for ways to automate the process of threat detection and response,"" the report states. ""The new generation of solutions and services promises to deploy machine learning and artificial intelligence, automating decision-making to improve the overall performance of the security stack.""Data Out or Cloud InVaronis' MDDR service aims to help companies track their sensitive data and detect any potential misuse of, or threats to, that data. The service focuses on securing the business from the data outward. At the time of a breach, the most important thing is to identify whether an unauthorized user is accessing data and to block their activity, Radolec says.""Data is this soft and gooey and permeable layer of their security stack, and so we start with security around data, and not just alerting and detection response, but security posture is a big part of what we do,"" he says. ""So we help organizations reduce what we call the blast radius, or how much information can any person get to how many resources can a person get to.""Many other security technologies look to prevent unauthorized users and potential threats from getting into the network and stealing or deleting data â€” starting with the cloud and moving into securing devices, users and data in the network.Every company will likely have their own answer to questions about whether to center their security around protecting data, protecting devices, protecting identities, or protecting the cloud first, says Forrester's Pollard.The truth is that no matter the starting point, the goal is the same, he says.""The answer is you need a detection and response service that works across the entirety of your detection surface, that includes identities, that includes data, that includes cloud, and that includes applications,"" he says. ""It's about avoiding niche offerings that operate in one segment and treating your tech stack like it's a silo, instead of looking at and finding something that is much more holistic and comprehensive. Those services are available; they exist today.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Managed Everything?

Automate Routine Operational Workflows with Generative AI,"Cybersecurity insights from industry experts.Automate Routine Operational Workflows With Generative AIGenAI has the potential to revolutionize how organizations approach enterprise security, compliance, identity, and management processes.February 6, 2024When you think about your day-to-day responsibilities across security, compliance, identity, and management, how much of that work follows a repeatable process? How much more efficient could you be if those processes were automated through generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)?GenAI has the power to greatly streamline operational workflows and democratize knowledge across the entire security team, regardless of experience levels or knowledge about a specific technology or threat vector. Rather than having to manually research information on their own, SOC analysts can use natural language processing (NLP) embedded within GenAI models to ask questions and receive answers in a more natural format. NLP also gives GenAI the flexibility to ""understand"" what a user is asking and adapt to their style or preferences.However, it's important to recognize that GenAI is not intended to replace human expertise. Rather, it should help analysts respond to threats more efficiently by assisting them with guided recommendations and best practices based on the organization's own security data, known threat intelligence, and existing processes. Here's how.Establish Trust Through TransparencyBefore a security, compliance, identity, or management workflow can be automated, teams first need to be confident that all of the information at their disposal is complete and accurate. Routine back-end work is an ideal candidate for automation because it is both predictable and easily verified. Rather than having analysts spend their time responding to simple help-desk tickets or writing incident reports, why not leverage NLP and GenAI to automate those tasks? This way analysts can dedicate their time to more business-critical work.For this to work effectively, GenAI models must be transparent. Analysts should be able to understand the sources that the AI model pulled from and easily validate that information to ensure the AI is providing accurate recommendations.At Microsoft, we've defined, published, and implemented ethical principles to guide our AI work. And we've built out constantly improving engineering and governance systems to put these principles into practice. Transparency is one of the foundational principles of our Responsible AI framework, alongside fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, and accountability.How to Deploy GenAI in Your EnvironmentA number of repeatable, multistep processes across security, compliance, identity, and management are primed for automation.For example, when investigating incidents, analysts often have to examine scripts, command-line arguments, or suspicious files that may have been executed on an endpoint. Rather than manually researching this information, analysts can simply provide the script they observed and ask the AI model to break it down using a collection of prompts put together to accomplish specific security-related tasks. Each prompt book requires a specific input â€” for example, a code snippet or a threat actor name.The script is then explained step by step and the AI model is consulted to provide input as to whether the script may be malicious. From there, if any network indicator is present, it's correlated against threat intelligence and relevant results are summarized before being included. The AI can also provide recommendations based on the script actions and generate a report that summarizes the session for nontechnical audiences.Using AI this way provides two core benefits. First, the AI can automatically upskill users who may not understand the complexities of analyzing a script or file using a very transparent, repeatable process. Second, it saves time by having the model assist with common follow-up actions, such as correlating any indicators to threat intelligence and writing a summary report.Another GenAI use case is device management and compliance through conditional access policies. If devices don't meet specific policies, they are restricted from accessing company resources. This can lead to machines being locked out and users filing internal tickets to resolve the issue. In this scenario, IT operations or help-desk support staff can leverage NLP prompts to input the unique device identifier and quickly understand the compliance status of the device. The AI can then use NLP to explain why the device is noncompliant and provide step-by-step instructions on how to resolve the issue in the appropriate tool. This is powerful because someone without direct experience in a particular tool can now perform the task, avoiding the need to escalate.Ultimately, GenAI has the potential to completely revolutionize the way we approach enterprise security, compliance, identity, and management processes. By extending our thinking on how to apply GenAI in operational roles, we can save practitioners time, equip them with new skills, and ensure their time is spent on what matters most.â€” Read more Partner Perspectives from Microsoft SecurityRead more about:Partner PerspectivesAbout the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE
Microsoft Azure HDInsight Bugs Expose Big Data to Breaches,"February 6, 2024Three high-risk vulnerabilities have been uncovered in Microsoft Azure's big-data analytics service HDInsight.Four and a half months after disclosing eight cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the cloud data tool, Orca Security has published new findings involving one denial-of-service (DoS) and two privilege escalation bugs afflicting the same service.This new trio opens the door to performance issues and unauthorized administrative access, and all that comes with it: attackers reading, writing, deleting, and performing any other management operations over an organization's sensitive data.Three New Bugs in Azure HDInsightOne of the new escalation bugs affects Apache Ambari, an open source tool that simplifies Apache Hadoop cluster deployment, management, and monitoring.CVE-2023-38156, assigned a ""high"" 7.2 out of 10 score on the CVSS scale, concerns the URL endpoint associated with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), a Java application programming interface (API) responsible for defining how a client may access a database. By manipulating the JDBC endpoint, the researchers discovered they could successfully drop a reverse shell and escalate from regular user privileges to root access in a Hadoop cluster.The other two vulnerabilities relate to Apache Oozie, a workflow scheduler for Hadoop.The more serious of the two, CVE-2023-36419 is caused by a lack of proper user input validation, opening the door to XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks. An attacker exploiting XXE in the workflow scheduler could escalate privileges and read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. CVE-2023-36419 was assigned a ""high"" 8.8 CVSS score by Microsoft, but a ""critical"" 9.8 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) National Vulnerability Database (NVD).The other moderate-severity bug also derives from a lack of proper input validation, when a user requests logs for a specific job by specifying a very large range of actions, causing an intensive loop that the system can't handle. Doing so can slow down or outright freeze the Oozie dashboard, cause delays, failures, or other errors in scheduling and managing Oozie jobs, and cause performance degradation to other services on the same host.Why Azure HDInsight Vulnerabilities MatterData processing tools in an organizational setting can house massive troves of valuable information.""HDInsight is used to perform analysis on 'Big Data,' meaning large amounts of structured, unstructured, and fast-moving data,"" explains Bar Kaduri, research team leader at Orca Security. ""Typically, itâ€™' the larger organizations who are using big data analytics to identify new business opportunities and facilitate strategic decisions.""Indeed, some of the world's largest corporations â€” including Unilever, MetLife, Ernst & Young, and more, according to business data aggregators â€” make use of Azure HDInsight.""We can safely assume that this big data is likely to contain valuable and confidential customer and market information which organizations would want to do their utmost to protect,"" Kaduri says, emphasizing the need for organizations to patch diligently as new security gaps rise to the surface.All three of the new bugs were fixed as of Oct. 26. HDInsight users are recommended to implement Microsoft's latest patch if they haven't already, with one caveat: The service does not support in-place upgrades.To properly protect their applications, HDInsight users must create a cluster with the latest platform version and updates, then migrate the old to the new.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",vulnerability reports,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
UAE Cybersecurity Official Warns of VPN Abuse,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.UAE Cybersecurity Official Warns of VPN AbuseMore than 6 million VPNs are now deployed on devices in the United Arab Emirates.February 6, 2024The top cyber official in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) worries that virtual private networks (VPNs) are being misused in the country.""We have no problem with people using VPNs, but using it for bad things is the problem,"" Muhammad Al Kuwaiti, head of cybersecurity at UAE Government, recently told local reporters.UAE residents increased their downloads of VPN apps by 1.83 million in 2023, reaching a total of 6.1 million, according to the Global VPN Adoption Index by Atlas VPN.This pushed the UAE VPN adoption rate to 61.7% last year, the second highest in the world after Qatarâ€™s 69.87%.Strict Regulations and CensorshipVPN usage in the UAE is high because the country set strict regulations on Internet content, including the censorship of designated websites and online services, says Ezzeldin Hussein, regional director, sales engineering, Middle East, Turkey and Africa (META), SentinelOne.""VPNs allow users to bypass these restrictions and access content that may be blocked or unavailable in the country, such as VoIP services,"" Hussein explains.He added that the UAE is a global commerce hub, so visiting business travelers often use VPNs to access corporate networks, communicate securely abroad, and overcome geo-restrictions on services and content.Individuals in the UAE also turn to VPNs to encrypt their Internet traffic and protect their personal information from surveillance, hacking, and data breaches, he notes.VPNs for WhatsApp, FaceTime AccessNord Security says the usage of VPN is growing in the UAE and wider Gulf as residents use it make audio-video calls through apps such as WhatsApp, Skype, FaceTime, and dating apps.However, the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA) guidelines clearly forbids the use of VPNs for illegal means, including hiding an IP address to gain access to forbidden communications sites, such as WhatsApp â€” which is seen to be a rival to the government's incumbent VoIP services.Under the decree law to combat false rumors (or fake news) and cybercrimes, UAE residents who violate the law and misuse VPNs could face imprisonment and fines between Dh500,000 to Dh2 million.Gopan Sivasankaran, general manager at Secureworks for Middle East, Turkey, and Africa, says the UAE is home to a large percentage of expat workers who may be tempted to employ VPNs to access media content from their home country, or call international friends and family.Aside from the legal risks, Sivasankaran warns of consumer complacency surrounding VPN's unique cybersecurity risks.""In the same way that the cloud is sometimes dismissed as 'somebody else's computer,' third-party VPN services are 'somebody else's network.' They will protect your local traffic on a hotel or public WiFi network but that protection ends at the VPN service provider's server,"" he says. Rogue providers could potentially monetize, monitor, or interfere with VPN traffic, he adds.""The customer takes it on trust that nothing nefarious is done with their communications.""Cybercrime Investigation ChallengesFrom a national cybersecurity perspective, widespread VPN usage poses challenges for law enforcement and intelligence agencies tasked with monitoring cybercrime and national security threats, cautions SentinelOne's Hussein.""The anonymity afforded by VPNs can make it difficult to trace the origin of malicious activities or identify individuals involved in cyberattacks or other illicit activities conducted online,"" he says.""Ultimately, governments will face policy and regulatory challenges in balancing the need to protect cybersecurity with respecting individual privacy rights and freedom,"" Hussein adds. ""It is important to educate the general public about the responsible use of VPNs and the potential risks of VPN misuse.""Read more about:DR Global Middle East & AfricaAbout the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Crucial Airline Flight Planning App Open to Interception Risks,"February 6, 2024A mobile app that many airline pilots use for crucial flight planning purposes was open to attacks that could have interfered with safe takeoff and landing procedures due to a disabled security feature it contained.NAVBLUE, an Airbus-owned IT services company that developed the app, fixed the issue last year after researchers at UK-based Pen Test Partners (PTP) informed the company about the issue.And this week, PTP released details of its findings following Airbus' successful remediation of the application.Electronic Flight Bag AppsThe vulnerability was present in Flysmart+ Manager, an app that is part of a broader suite of Flysmart+ apps for so-called Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) platforms. An EFB device â€” usually an iPad or other tablet computer â€” basically hosts apps that flight crews use for flight planning calculations and for accessing a variety of digital documents such as operating manuals, navigational charts, and aircraft checklists. Some EFBs are directly integrated into the avionics systems of modern aircraft and provide an array of other more complex features, such as providing real-time weather information and tracking the aircraft's position on navigational systems.Flysmart+ specifically is a suite of iOS apps that assists with aircraft performance, weight, and balance-related calculations according to NAVBLUE. It can be fully integrated with Airbus' standard operating procedures, can be used during all phases of a flight, and provides pilots with access to a range of avionics parameters. Flysmart+ Manager, the app in which Pen Test Partners found the security issue, is an app that enables synchronization of data across the Flysmart+ suite.Disabled Security SettingResearchers from Pen Test Partners found that an App Transport Security (ATS) feature in Flysmart+ Manager that would have forced the app to use HTTPS had not been enabled. The app did not have any form of certificate validation either, leaving it exposed to interception on open and untrusted networks. ""An attacker could use this weakness to intercept and decrypt potentially sensitive information in transit,"" PTP said in its report this week.Ken Munro, a partner at the pen testing firm, says the biggest concern had to do with the potential for attacks on the app that could cause so called runway excursions â€” or veer-offs and overruns â€” and potential tail strikes on takeoff. ""The EFB is used to calculate the required power from the engines for departure, also the required braking on landing,"" Munro says. ""We showed that, as a result of the missing ATS setting, one could potentially tamper with the data that is then given to pilots. That data is used during these 'performance' calculations, so pilots could apply insufficient power or not enough braking action,"" he says.The ATS issue in Flysmart+ Manager is just one of several vulnerabilities that PTP has uncovered in EFBs in recent years. In May 2023, for instance, the firm reported an integrity check bypass flaw in a Lufthansa EFB app called Lido eRouteManual that gave attackers a way to modify flight planning data that pilots using the app received. In July 2022, researchers at PTP showed how they could modify manuals on an EFB pertaining to the effectiveness of de-icing procedures on aircraft wings.Hard to ExploitFrom a practical standpoint the disabled ATS setting issue that PTP identified in the Airbus EFB was not especially easy to exploit. To pull it off, an attacker would have first needed to be within Wi-Fi range of an EFB with the vulnerable app. More significantly, the attack would have been possible only during an app update â€” meaning the threat actor would need to know when the update was happening so they could insert their malicious code during the process.According to PTP, those conditions can occur during pilot layovers. ""Airline EFBs can be exposed to interception on untrusted networks given pilot layover hotels are well known and used consistently each night,"" the firm said.Pilots usually bring their EFBs with them during layovers because the devices contain their electronic roster as well, Munro says. So, if an attacker was within Wi-Fi range of the device at a hotel they could potentially initiate an attack. ""Missing ATS would allow a man-in-the-middle attack over Wi-Fi, at which point the attacker could push a tampered database update to the EFB,"" he says.While an attack can only happen during an app update, such updates need to happen on a regular basis, he adds. That improves the odds for a successful attack, Munro notes. ""A quirk of the aviation industry means that the software MUST be updated once every 30 days to remain legal,"" he says.

"Experts Detail New Flaws in Azure HDInsight Spark, Kafka, and Hadoop Services","Three new security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Azure HDInsight's Apache Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark services that could be exploited to achieve privilege escalation and a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) condition.""The new vulnerabilities affect any authenticated user of Azure HDInsight services such as Apache Ambari and Apache Oozie,"" Orca security researcher Lidor Ben Shitrit said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.The list of flaws is as follows -- CVE-2023-36419 (CVSS score: 8.8) - Azure HDInsight Apache Oozie Workflow Scheduler XML External Entity (XXE) Injection Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability- CVE-2023-38156 (CVSS score: 7.2) - Azure HDInsight Apache Ambari Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) Injection Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability- Azure HDInsight Apache Oozie Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) Vulnerability (no CVE)The two privilege escalation flaws could be exploited by an authenticated attacker with access to the target HDI cluster to send a specially crafted network request and gain cluster administrator privileges.The XXE flaw is the result of a lack of user input validation that allows for root-level file reading and privilege escalation, while the JDBC injection flaw could be weaponized to obtain a reverse shell as root.""The ReDoS vulnerability on Apache Oozie was caused by a lack of proper input validation and constraint enforcement, and allowed an attacker to request a large range of action IDs and cause an intensive loop operation, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS),"" Ben Shitrit explained.Successful exploitation of the ReDoS vulnerability could result in a disruption of the system's operations, cause performance degradation, and negatively impact both the availability and reliability of the service.Following responsible disclosure, Microsoft has rolled out fixes as part of updates released on October 26, 2023.The development arrives nearly five months after Orca detailed a collection of eight flaws in the open-source analytics service that could be exploited for data access, session hijacking, and delivering malicious payloads.In December 2023, Orca also highlighted a ""potential abuse risk"" impacting Google Cloud Dataproc clusters that take advantage of a lack of security controls in Apache Hadoop's web interfaces and default settings when creating resources to access any data on the Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) without any authentication.",vulnerability reports,vulnerability reports,TRUE
Infosec pros sound off on usefulness of higher education,"Half of polled infosec pros say their degree was less than useful for real-world workThe other half paid attention in class?Half of infosec professionals polled by Kaspersky said any cybersecurity knowledge they picked up from their higher education is at best somewhat useful for doing their day jobs. On the other hand, half said the know-how was at least very useful. We're a glass half-empty lot.The Moscow-headquartered multinational revealed those figures today in the first part of a multi-stage report based on a survey of 1,012 infosec professionals across 29 countries.About a quarter of those probed said their higher education was ""not at all useful"" for their working life in cybersecurity; 12 percent said it was ""slightly useful;"" and 14 percent described it as ""somewhat useful,"" adding up to 50 percent for the negatives. On the flip side, 29 percent said their education was ""extremely"" useful, and 21 percent said ""very"" useful.Here's what Kaspersky had to say about that:The lack of teaching personnel with real-world experience in the cybersecurity might be one of the biggest reasons explaining traditional educationâ€™s detachment from the industry and respondents hesitating to call their formal studies useful.Or it might be that they took the wrong course, or didn't pay attention, but that's just our opinion. And we should include this part from Kaspersky's report to give you more context:Of the infosec professionals with two to five yearsâ€™ experience, just 19 percent feel their formal education was extremely useful or very useful in their day-to-day work, while three-quarters of these young professionals say the theoretical knowledge they got was not useful in helping them fulfil their responsibilities. However, this trend is skewed towards mid and senior level professionals.If you were wondering what subjects these industry professionals studied â€“ for instance, it's no surprise that someone taking physics found that less than useful for IT security â€“ we pondered that, too. Kaspersky said 36 percent of those polled said the highest-level of education they got was in engineering, 21 percent said information technology, 15 percent said computer science, 13 percent said business management, 10 percent said science, and three percent said mathematics or something else.We're told 43 percent of the polled cybersecurity professionals actually studied information security as part of their official curriculum. Which perhaps better explains the above 50-50 split on usefulness.Keep upThere is another possible angle here. Security technology â€” and tech in general â€” moves fast and becomes ""legacy"" in one or two years, it's believed.""If you are studying for a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, for instance, you are preparing for a four-year course,"" said one survey respondent who works as a bank CIO in Brazil. ""But in those four years the tech has advanced so much that the knowledge you acquired in the first or second year is already outdated in your third or fourth years of study.""As mentioned above, an overall skills gap in the IT security industry may have caused or is fueling a shortage of qualified instructors who have practical industry experience as opposed to theoretical knowledge. Without those educators, graduates may feel the knowledge they gained is less than useful in the real world.Almost 40 percent of the polled infosec professionals worldwide said they ""somewhat disagree,"" ""disagree,"" or ""strongly disagree"" that their college or university professors had real-world experience. Breaking that down: 32 percent of North American respondents said they disagreed their tutors had real-life experience; 35 percent for Europe; and 37 percent for the Asia-Pacific region.- Wait, security courses aren't a requirement to graduate with a computer science degree?- Infosec pros can secure IT, but have harder time securing job satisfaction- Ransomware attacks hospitalizing security pros, as one admits suicidal feelings- Infosec still (mostly) a boys clubThe regions with the smallest number of academic instructors with industry experience are in Russia (42 percent of respondents in that region disagreed their tutors had outside experience) and the Middle East, Turkey and Africa (48 percent).Latin America seemed to have the highest report with only 20 percent of people surveyed disagreeing that their professors had practical experience in the field.Overall, half of the respondents rated the availability of infosec courses in higher education institutions as poor (27 percent) or very poor (23 percent), and this number jumped to 83 percent for professionals with between two and five work experience under their belt.According to one professional from the US: ""There was no such thing as handling real-life situations, it was simulating real security incidents and learning to respond effectively. So this was missing from the educational programs. Handling actual security incidents requires a different set of skills than theoretical knowledge alone.""

New Report From Flare Highlights Pervasive Threat of Initial Access Brokers in NATO Countries,"February 7, 2024PRESS RELEASEMontreal, Quebec, Canada â€“ February 6, 2024 â€“ Flare, the leading Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) solution provider, has released a new report that explores and analyzes the cyber threat landscape and threats to NATO countries created by initial access brokers (IABs) on Russian-language hacking forums.IABs are key players in the cybercrime landscape. They infiltrate systems and gain unauthorized access through various techniques, including spear-phishing, exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, and leveraging leaked and stolen credentials, with the primary goal of establishing persistence in these environments.For this report, Flare analyzed hundreds of IAB posts on the Russian-language hacking forums, and discovered recent activity in 21 out of the 31 NATO countries - confirming the extensive reach and consistent potential threat IABs pose to national security and economic stability.One of the key findings of the report is the threat actors' preference for targeting critical infrastructure sectors in NATO member states - their strategic value allowing IABs to demand higher prices in the cybercrime market. The report also highlights the anonymized nature of IAB posts and the careful efforts of threat actors to conceal sensitive details, which poses challenges in identifying victims.The analysis indicates a clear trend toward targeted cyberattacks on the US defense sector, and a higher price point for access to US defense contractors. This reflects the high value of these targets and suggests that threat actors recognize the significant impact of infiltrating defense-related systems.""Geopolitics are no longer isolated from cybercrime,"" said Eric Clay, VP Marketing at Flare. ""As global tensions have increased weâ€™ve seen a spillover where nation-states may directly leverage cybercrime groups to further their aims.""To better understand the IAB threat landscape targeting entities in NATO member states, Flare presents a snapshot of recent IAB sales from the Exploit forum in the report. These sales, involving entities in 21 NATO countries and primarily from the years 2023 and 2024, represent just a small sample of the multitude of IAB listings.To explore this research and the significant impact of IABs gaining unauthorized access to the sensitive information of NATO member states, please read the full report at https://flare.io/learn/resources/initial-access-broker-landscape-in-nato-member-states-on-exploit-forum/.About FlareFlare provides the Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) solution for organizations.

Spyware business booming despite government crackdowns,"The spyware business is booming despite government crackdowns'Almost zero data being shared across the industry on this particular threat,' we're toldUpdated The commercial spyware economy â€“ despite government and big tech's efforts to crack down â€“ appears to be booming.In addition to the major players like Pegasus developer NSO Group, and Predator maker Intellexa, Googleâ€™s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has found ""dozens of smaller"" commercial surveillance vendors and tracks around 40 such organizations.Other exploitation supply chain orgs also make money from these nefarious tools â€“ from the initial exploit developers and suppliers on through to the spyware vendors that charge varying amounts depending on what capabilities the customer requests.In 2023, TAG reports it uncovered 25 zero-days under active exploitation, and 20 of these were abused by commercial surveillance vendors.""All these players enable the proliferation of dangerous tools and capabilities used by governments against individuals, which threatens the safety of the internet ecosystem and the trust on which a vibrant and inclusive digital society depends,"" according to a TAG report published on Tuesday.The safety of the internet is not the only thing at stake as a result of spyware vendorsâ€™ efforts: the report shares stories of victims such as human rights advocates and journalists whose devices were infected with Pegasus.These tools have also been used to secure the detention of political dissidents, lawyers, journalists and activists. Some deployments of spyware have been blamed for victimsâ€™ deaths. This, despite assurances from some of the surveillance vendors that their products can only be sold to governments and used to fight terrorism and other serious crimes.""I have yet to see any reporting on legitimate use of this software,"" Cisco Talos head of outreach Nick Biasini lamented in an interview with The Register.""That's not to say that it doesn't exist,"" he added. ""It could be used in highly classified environments so that information never sees the light of day. But the majority of the activity seems to be around dissidents, activists, reporters, lawyers and those types of victims, which implies a non-standard application of the technology.""Government to the rescue?Western governments are taking steps to curb this $12-billion-a-year industry. On Monday, the US announced it would impose visa restrictions on anyone involved in the abuse of commercial spyware. Presumably, this extends from the makers and suppliers all the way to end-users.That action follows last year's executive order banning the US government's use of commercial spyware that presents a national security risk to America â€“ although, as The Register pointed out at the time, the order includes big loopholes for Uncle Sam's snoops and American-made products.On Tuesday, a group of 35 nations, led by the UK and France, signed an agreement to ""tackle proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber intrusion tools and services."" Tech giants including Apple, Google and Microsoft also reportedly participated, but declined to comment.Despite these and other efforts, the spyware business ""appears to be booming,"" Biasini observed. ""There's a lot of growth. If you look at the offensive conferences â€“ especially the ones in Europe that have been going on â€“ there are just a deluge of vendors that sit in this space.""The spyware economyOne of the ""bigger trends"" that Talos is tracking within the spyware economy is the ""decoupling between the commercial spyware vendors and the vulnerability and exploit vendors,"" Biasini added.According to TAG, spyware users typically use exploit chains, rather than a single point of entry, to remotely drop spyware to the target's devices. This usually includes three or four zero-days, the report indicates. The findings don't include any pricing info for these zero-days â€“ which tend to allow remote code execution, sandbox escape and local privilege escalation.The TAG report does include some details on spyware vendors' pricing models â€“ but nothing new.One is a widely sourced 2021 New York Times publication of a pitch document for Predator. The base price of â‚¬8 million ($8.6 million) buys the user a remote, one-click exploit chain to install spyware implants on Android and iOS devices and the ability to run ten concurrent implants. Intellexa provides project management, and a 12-month warranty on the contract.The second is an offer for NOVA â€“ an Intellexa Alliance combined spyware and data analysis system that was leaked on the XSS.is cybercrime forum in 2022. In addition to the base price, users can buy persistence on victim devices for an extra â‚¬3 million ($3.2 million), and an additional five-country package for another â‚¬1.2 million ($1.3 million).- US judge rejects spyware slinger NSO's attempt to bin Apple lawsuit- Kaspersky reveals previously unknown hardware 'feature' exploited in iPhone attacks- Think tank report labels NSO, Lazarus as 'cyber mercenaries'- US Commerce Dept pinky swears it won't push American spyware on world-plus-dogWhen asked about these pricing models, and what Talos has seen, Biasini explained the NYT story and the XXS leak are the only two data points he's aware of. ""We are basically operating on two leaked pieces of data,"" he noted. ""That's all we have.""This illustrates another part of the problem: the spyware economy remains mysterious.""There is almost zero data being shared across the industry on this particular threat, and that is a massive problem,"" Biasini worried. ""If we really want to fix this, we need more eyes on this â€“ not less. As someone who operates in the tech space, it is a Herculean effort for us to get samples to be able to analyze, and that should not be the case.""In addition to samples of the malware itself, investigators need indicators of compromise, and hashes â€“ things that are lacking in spyware reports. Similarly, none of the sources The Register contacted for this story could, or would, provide us with any other examples of or information about spyware pricing models.All of this contributes to a lack of visibility, which allows the miscreants abusing surveillance tools to operate with impunity while their victims live in fear. Â®Updated to add""The recent UK Pall Mall Process highlights a growing international alarm over the global spyware crisis,"" Elina Castillo JimÃ©nez, advocacy coordinator at the security lab at Amnesty Tech told The Register.""While a positive step, the declaration is far short of what is needed to rein in the commercial surveillance industry. States must adopt a ban on highly intrusive spyware altogether and establish robust safeguards for any permissible use of other forms of spyware.""International law already defines legitimate spyware applications narrowly; instead of debating this, the focus must shift to protecting individuals from unlawful surveillance. Furthermore â€“ there is a lot that can be done by governments individually â€“ including through ceasing to purchase products from commercial surveillance vendors, enforcing export regulations, and providing accountability for already documented victims of spyware.""",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
China's Cyberattackers Maneuver to Disrupt US Critical Infrastructure,"Lurking for 5 years, Volt Typhoon is positioning itself to physically disrupt and cripple US critical infrastructure by gaining access to operational technology networks in the energy, water, communications, and transportation sectors, according to CISA.February 7, 2024The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a report detailing how the China-backed Volt Typhoon advanced persistent threat (APT) is consistently targeting highly sensitive critical infrastructure, with new information on the cyberattackers' pivot to operational technology (OT) networks once they've burrowed inside.Given that the OT network is responsible for the physical functions of industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) equipment, the findings clearly corroborate the ongoing suspicion that Chinese hackers are looking to be able to disrupt critical physical operations in energy, water utilities, communications, and transportation, presumably to cause panic and discord in the event of a kinetic conflagration between the US and China.""Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions,"" according to CISA's Volt Typhoon advisory. [We] ""are concerned about the potential for these actors to use their network access for disruptive effects in the event of potential geopolitical tensions and/or military conflicts.""It's an important set of revelations, according to John Hultquist, chief analyst at Mandiant Intelligence/Google Cloud.""Previously, we could deduce from targeting that the actor had a strong interest in critical infrastructure that had little intelligence value,"" he said in an emailed analysis. But the CISA report shows that ""Volt Typhoon is gathering information on, and even penetrating, OT systems â€” the highly sensitive systems that run the physical processes at the heart of critical infrastructure,"" he added. ""Under the right conditions, OT systems could be manipulated to cause major shutdowns of essential services, or even to create dangerous conditions.""Hultquist added, ""If there was any skepticism as to why this actor is carrying out these intrusions, this revelation should put it to rest.""Living Off the Land & Hiding for 5 YearsCISA also revealed today that Volt Typhoon (aka Vanguard Panda, Bronze Silhouette, Dev-0391, UNC3236, Voltzite, and Insidious Taurus) has secretly hidden in US infrastructure for half a decade â€” even though they were first publicly outed by Microsoft only last year.""Unlike ransomware operators whose goal is to get in and cause damage quickly, this nation-state operator is leveraging valid accounts and 'living off the land' [LOTL] techniques to evade detection for long periods of time,"" Ken Westin, field CISO at Panther Lab, said in an emailed comment. ""These methods allow the group to monitor their targets and provide a foothold to cause kinetic damage.""To boot, the APT ""also relies on valid accounts and leverage[s] strong operational security, which ... allows for long-term undiscovered persistence,"" CISA explained. ""Volt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre-exploitation reconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment; tailor their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the victim's environment; and dedicate ongoing resources to maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time, even after initial compromise.""While Volt Typhoon's strategy of staying hidden by using legitimate utilities and blending in with normal traffic isn't a new phenomenon in cybercrime, it does make it difficult for potential targets to actively scan for malicious activity, according to CISA, which issued extensive LOTL guidance today for doing just that.Meanwhile, an infrastructure update, while it could in some cases require a costly and labor-intensive forklift replacement, might not go awry either.""Many of the OT environments being targeted are notorious for running outdated software, either out of negligence or necessity, if the systems cannot be updated, which increases the risk posed by this threat,"" Westin said.Worryingly, CISA also noted that the danger extends beyond the US. Last month, SecurityScorecard's STRIKE team identified new infrastructure linked to Volt Typhoon that indicated the APT was also targeting Australian and UK government assets. The CISA report broadens that risk to also include Canada and New Zealand â€” all of these US partners' infrastructure is also susceptible to nation-state actors, it warned.CISA's advisory comes on the heels of a government action to disrupt the group's small office/home office (SOHO) router botnet, which it used to throw off those tracking its activity. In a bit of good news, according to researchers at Lumen's Black Lotus Labs this week, the group has so far failed to revive the botnet.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
"As Smart Cities Expand, So Do the Threats","Cybersecurity In-Depth: Feature articles on security strategy, latest trends, and people to know.As Smart Cities Expand, So Do the ThreatsThe systems that make up a smart city ecosystem are not easily secured and require better design and better policy to ensure they are not vulnerable.February 6, 2024For technologists, building smart cities is not an aspirational goal but a matter of necessity. The World Bank estimates that 70% of the world's population will be living in urban areas by 2050, up from 56% today. This massive population shift will place increasing pressure on city infrastructure and technology used to manage urban areas. Increased automation will also bring new threats.While the concept of a smart city may seem monolithic, in reality it is a collection of independent technologies and systems communicating with each other and a central management hub, creating a diverse ecosystem of technologies â€” one that needs to be well secured, says Piyush Pandey, the US cyber data market leader at business consultancy Deloitte. In many cases, those technologies have not been adequately secured individually, let alone as an interdependent ecosystem exposed to the public, he says.""This is obviously not just one system that needs to be secure. ... With this smart ecosystem and the massive number of interconnections, we are consciously allowing our network to be exposed,"" Pandey says. ""The security is not really limited to applying some sort of a firewall or physical security at the device level. We have to look at this in a holistic fashion.""A number of countries are pursuing the concept of smart cities, from governments in the Middle East and Africa to Singapore's claim as the smartest city in the world. A city can collect more than 500 million events per day from its diverse array of systems â€” smart electric meters, street lights, transportation monitors, and emergency management systems â€” according to a recent Deloitte report on securing smart ecosystems. While the convergence of information technology (IT), operational technology (OT), the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation will lead to increased efficiency, the smarts of a smart city will also result in a greater vulnerability to threats.Ransomware has become a major issue for local governments, and the increasing automation of cities adds to the operational challenges, with concerns that ransomware could shut down civic operations.A Trio of Risk DriversFrom intelligent transportation systems, to smart electrical grids, to just-in-time critical infrastructure, smart city systems link a vast pool of devices â€” many with no built-in security features of their own â€” to untrusted systems, such as smartphones, legacy technologies, and desktops running out-of-date software. The three most vulnerable and impactful systems are those used for emergency alerts, street video surveillance, and smart traffic lights, according to a 2020 survey of smart-city security experts conducted by UC Berkeley's Center for Long Term Cybersecurity (CLTC).Many of those systems were put in place without much consideration for cybersecurity, says Rowland Herbert-Faulkner, graduate researcher in city and regional planning affiliated with CLTC.""We don't have built-in product security for a lot of things, and if we don't put that in place, then we are still broadening the threat landscape. The risks go up exponentially,"" he says. ""That's something that's come up in research for quite a while: How do we deal with product security, especially when we're dealing with these interconnected systems? Especially when someone's device can be used as an attack vector or as an entry point into the system.""Three main factors â€” convergence, interoperability, and integration â€” drive risks in smart city ecosystems, according to Deloitte's report. The marriage of cyber and physical systems â€” convergence â€” allows one domain to affect the other, dramatically increasing the attack surface. Devices from different systems â€” some old, and some new â€” interoperate with one another, putting old systems that were never intended to be connected at risk. Finally, the tight integration of devices across systems means that an attack can quickly impact other systems, creating a cascading of impacts.""Not only are the boundaries blurred because there are no organizational boundaries in a smart ecosystem, there are no system boundaries because now we are talking about the cyber and physical convergence,"" says Deloitte's Pandey. ""We have multiple different vendors coming into play with different devices and disparate systems that have varying degrees of security controls, so now when they are interconnected, the weakest system [becomes] the problem.""Smart Device Security: A 20-Year ProblemThe different systems vary by purpose â€” smart license-plate readers have a different architecture than the smart electrical grid â€” and also by protocols. While they are likely to communicate over wireless technologies, they also are likely to talk to each other through centralized hubs. Most devices cannot run security agents because such add-on security would cause too great of a performance hit for many programmable logic controllers, IoT devices, and other low-power hardware, says Tom Pace, CEO of XIoT security firm NetRise.""It'll probably get there, but that's like a 20-year problem,"" he says. ""What you really need to do is have most of these device manufacturers standardize on some operating system and processor architecture. Otherwise, you're asking companies to create like 1,000 different agents that need to be installed. It's just never going to work.""In addition to the technology aspects of the problem, a great deal of cybersecurity expertise still needs to be developed to tackle smart cities. Improving the cybersecurity posture for smart cities is critical, says UC Berkeley's Herbert-Faulkner. Because of the impact of ransomware on local government agencies, cyber insurers have pulled back from issuing policies, for example, and have become much more stringent.""Cyber insurers are not too interested in covering cities because a lot of local government personnel don't have the basics down â€” they don't have a framework in place that's going to help them mitigate this risk,"" he says. ""Bringing city and local government personnel up to speed in terms of basic cyber hygiene is going to be critical, and we see this particularly when you're talking about risk mitigation.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Why Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingFeb 8, 2024|5 Min ReadAs Smart Cities Expand, So Do the ThreatsFeb 6, 2024|5 Min ReadName That Edge Toon: The Great EscapeFeb 5, 2024|1 Min ReadA Cyber Insurer's Perspective on How to Avoid RansomwareJan 29, 2024|5 Min Read",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE

U.S. Imposes Visa Restrictions on those Involved in Illegal Spyware Surveillance,"The U.S. State Department said it's implementing a new policy that imposes visa restrictions on individuals who are linked to the illegal use of commercial spyware to surveil civil society members.""The misuse of commercial spyware threatens privacy and freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. ""Such targeting has been linked to arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings in the most egregious of cases.""The latest measures, underscoring continued efforts on part of the U.S. government to curtail the proliferation of surveillance tools, are designed to ""promote accountability"" for individuals involved in commercial spyware misuse.The new policy covers people who have used such tools to ""unlawfully surveil, harass, suppress, or intimidate individuals,"" as well as those who stand to financially benefit from the misuse.It also includes the companies (aka private sector offensive actors or PSOAs) that develop and sell the spyware to governments and other entities. It's currently not clear how the new restrictions will be enforced for individuals who possess passports that don't require a visa to enter the U.S.However, CyberScoop notes that executives potentially affected by the ban would no longer be eligible to participate in the visa waiver program, and that they would need to apply for a visa to travel to the U.S.The development comes days after Access Now and the Citizen Lab revealed that 35 journalists, lawyers, and human-rights activists in the Middle Eastern nation of Jordan were targeted with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware.In November 2021, the U.S. government sanctioned NSO Group and Candiru, another spyware vendor, for developing and supplying cyber weapons to foreign governments that ""used these tools to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers.""Then early last year, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order barring federal government agencies from using commercial spyware that could pose national security risks. In July 2023, the U.S. also placed Intellexa and Cytrox on a trade blocklist.According to an intelligence assessment released by the U.K. Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in April 2023, at least 80 countries have purchased commercial cyber intrusion software over the past decade.Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), in a comprehensive report about the commercial spyware landscape shared with The Hacker News, said there are dozens of smaller vendors such as Cy4Gate, Negg Group, and Variston who ""enable the proliferation of dangerous tools and capabilities used by governments against individuals.""For example, Italian company Cy4Gate, which acquired RCS Lab in March 2022, is the maker of Android and iOS spyware known as Epeius. Negg Group, which is also from Italy, develops a strain of mobile spyware codenamed VBiss that's delivered via one-click exploit chains. It has also been linked to another Android malware known as Skygofree.""If governments ever had a monopoly on the most sophisticated capabilities, that era is certainly over,"" TAG said, adding it's tracking nearly 40 companies with varying levels of sophistication. ""The private sector is now responsible for a significant portion of the most sophisticated tools we detect.""This is exemplified by the fact that of the 25 zero-days that were exploited in the wild in 2023, 20 were weaponized by PSOAs. Furthermore, 35 out of 72 zero-days found in Google products since 2014 have been actively exploited by commercial vendors.""The development of surveillance technology often begins with the discovery of a vulnerability and ends with a government customer collecting data from spyware installed on a high risk user's device,"" TAG further noted, calling out the roles played by exploit developers, exploit brokers, and the vendors themselves, who sell the spyware as a product along with the initial delivery mechanisms and the exploits.(The story was updated after publication to include additional insights shared by Google's Threat Analysis Group.)",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE
It's not just Volt Typhoon lurking in critical US orgs' IT,"Volt Typhoon not the only Chinese crew lurking in US energy, critical networksPresumably American TLAs are all over Beijing's infrastructure, too ... right?Volt Typhoon isn't the only Chinese spying crew infiltrating computer networks in America's energy sector and other critical organizations with the aim of wrecking equipment and causing other headaches, the US government has said.This warning came within hours of Uncle Sam earlier today confirming Volt Typhoon had compromised ""multiple"" IT environments across communications, energy, transportation, water, and wastewater processing sectors in the United States. American officials said China's cyberspies were able to avoid detection and snoop around those networks, in some cases for up to five years. There is a fear that President Xi has instructed agents to sneak into America's key civil systems, and lay in wait to steal data and trigger disruption to vital services and supply lines as needed.Volt Typhoon is certainly not the only Chinese group conducting this type of activity""This stealthy access increases our concern that they are lurking, waiting for the right moment to cause devastating impact,"" said Cynthia Kaiser, deputy assistant director for the FBI's cybersecurity division, on a call with journalists Wednesday afternoon.The Chinese snoops were seeking access to and information about organizations' operational technology to either position themselves for or gain vital information about these OT systems for future cyberattacks, she added.Last week, the FBI said it obtained search warrants and issued a remote kill command to wipe Volt Typhoon's botnet after the gang infected hundreds of end-of-life routers with backdoor malware to break into critical infrastructure networks.""But perhaps even more concerning is that Volt Typhoon is certainly not the only Chinese group conducting this type of activity,"" Kaiser noted. She declined to identify the other Beijing-backed gangs that have been found burrowing into US critical infrastructure.The US Department of Energy's Mara Winn echoed this assessment, and noted that DoE has been working with energy system owners and operators ""over the last several months"" to detect compromised systems and stamp out the intruders.""Our assessment is that the threat is actively positioning itself on critical infrastructure IT networks with the explicit goal of being able to disrupt the functioning of operational technology,"" said Winn, the deputy director for preparedness, policy, and risk assessment in the DOE's Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response.- US says China's Volt Typhoon is readying destructive cyberattacks- FBI confirms it issued remote kill command to blow out Volt Typhoon's botnet- Is critical infrastructure prepared for OT ransomware?- We know nations are going after critical systems, but what happens when crims join in?In the Feds' Wednesday warning, officials emphasized the importance of identity management for critical infrastructure owners and operators. This includes implementing phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA).""What we see is these actors stealing administrative credentials and using those credentials to maintain persistent access to the network,"" CISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Eric Goldstein said on the call with reporters.OT systems could be manipulated to cause major shutdowns of essential services""Those credentials allow the PRC to conduct any activity that those administrators would be able to conduct on the network, whether that's deleting information off the network, whether the changing credentials for other users or other kinds of activities,"" he added.This is especially concerning given Volt Typhoon's interest in OT systems, according to John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google Cloud's Mandiant Intelligence. ""OT systems could be manipulated to cause major shutdowns of essential services, or even to create dangerous conditions,"" he told The Register.""Evidence of forays into OT systems justify our concerns that the actor is a serious threat,"" Hultquist added. ""If there was any skepticism as to why this actor was carrying out these intrusions, this revelation should put it to rest.""Presumably the concept of infiltrating and backdooring foreign critical infrastructure just in case has not escaped the bright minds at the Pentagon either.

Microsoft Adds Face Check to Entra Verified ID,"News, news analysis, and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology.Microsoft Adds Face Check to Entra Verified IDMicrosoft has released the public preview of Face Check, which detects a person's ""liveness"" and compares their appearance against existing documents, such as a driverâ€™s license, to verify identity.February 7, 2024Microsoft has added facial matching to its Entra Verified ID service, which lets organizations create and issue verifiable credentials to validate claims, such as employment, education, certifications, and residence. The new Face Check feature is available as a free public preview release, with a yet-unpriced commercial release slated for later this year.Face Check uses Microsoft's Azure AI Face API to match a person's real-time selfie â€” confirmed to be authentic via ""liveness detection"" â€” captured by the Microsoft Authenticator app with an existing trusted identity document, such as an employment ID, driver's license, or passport. Microsoft Authenticator's Verified ID feature generates a confidence score and sends it to the party who requested a Face Check.Early preview customers are using Face Check with Verified ID to reduce the risks of account takeover and impersonation for employees, vendors, and business guests. Help-desk and cybersecurity operations provider BEMO, an early Face Check tester, used the feature to verify the identity of an employee issuing a request, according to Microsoft.""Face Check using Entra Verified ID is a new verification capability that can be used to verify the person authenticating is indeed the rightful owner of authentication credentials, such as passkeys, or FIDO2, MFA, or even username and password,"" says Ankur Patel, Microsoft's head of product for Entra Verified ID. The company says Face Check is more reliable than self-attestation for accessing sensitive data or authentication to create new accounts.Extending Microsoft Entra ID with Verified IDVerified ID was built with a standards-based interop profile in partnership with IBM, Workday, Ping, and Mattr ""so anyone can build compatible digital wallets,"" Patel notes. Originally described by Patel as a standards-based decentralized identity (DID) system, Verified ID is intended to address the limitations of Microsoft Entra ID services (formerly Azure AD) by enabling the use of credentials beyond the organization.Gartner forecasts that integration with identity verification (IDV) and access management platforms will become standard by 2027 for onboarding, credentialing, and recovery. Further, IDV could reduce account takeover attacks by 75%, according to Gartner.""All access management [AM] vendors, including Microsoft and its direct competitors, offer the support to integrate with third-party IDV tools,"" says Gartner senior research director Henrique Teixeira. ""However, only a minority offer their own IDV solution and even fewer are combining it with a biometric authentication solution out of the box.""Facial Recognition Raises Privacy ConcernsWhile Microsoft promises a more user-friendly and secure approach to digital IDV with Face Check and Verified ID, critics of facial recognition have long decried the potential for misusing the technology. Microsoft's Patel describes Face Check as ""a privacy-respecting facial-matching feature for high-assurance verifications,"" noting that privacy concerns were taken into account.For one, the company emphasized that neither Microsoft Authenticator, Verified ID, nor the Azure AI services store or retain any of the data or images.""[When using Face Check], there's a 91% chance that it's me and not somebody else. So even if you got ahold of my phone, you couldn't use it,"" Patel says. Statistically, he adds, there is a one in a billion chance that a match could be an impersonation attack within a five-minute time window.Will 91% be reliable enough to satisfy concerns by enterprises providing access to sensitive data? Organizations can decide whether the risk is appropriate for specific types of business decisions and configure the acceptance score accordingly, according to Patel.Gartner's Teixeira predicts that preventing risks of attacks overshadows privacy issues.""I believe that the additional benefits of such solutions in reducing the probability of a breach will outweigh the privacy concerns associated with the technology,"" he says.The addition of Face Check to Verified ID aims to boost confidence in the credentials that users present. Patel says that Microsoft will soon reveal plans to extend its Face API pattern to verify a broader array of identity attributes, such as verified work history and legal entity verification, through partnerships with Dun & Bradstreet (DNB) and LexisNexis.Lots of Interest in Facial RecognitionDespite calls for regulation, facial recognition is one of the more popular forms of authentication. When the Biometrics Institute asked which form of biometrics organizations are likely to implement for its 2023 Industry Survey, 45% of respondents said they planned to increase their use of facial recognition. Coming in second was multimodal biometrics at 16%, followed by voice at 9%, iris at 7%, and behavioral at 6%.""The Microsoft approach is highly valuable for a broader scale of adoption of verified identities and is expected to benefit the entire industry,"" says KuppingerCole Analysts founder and principal analyst Martin Kuppinger. ""This will help in achieving critical mass.""Nevertheless, mass adoption won't happen in the short term, Kuppinger adds.""Challenges may arise regarding regulatory requirements for certain scenarios, but, basically, the approach helps in strengthening the cybersecurity posture and [ensures] privacy issues are addressed in a well-thought-out manner, avoiding sharing or centrally storing biometric information,"" he says.Cost will also be a factor.""Organizations surely will be keen to understanding the yet-to-be-announced licensing model before making strategic decisions,"" Kuppinger says.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Managed Everything?

Q&A: Tel Aviv Railway Project Bakes In Cyber Defenses,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Q&A: Tel Aviv Railway Project Bakes In Cyber DefensesHow a light railway in Israel is fortifying its cybersecurity architecture amid an increase in OT network threats.February 7, 2024Railway networks are suffering an increase in cyberattacks, most notably the August 2023 incident in which hackers infiltrated the radio frequency communications of Poland's railway network and temporarily disrupted train traffic.This has led to nations and rail operators scrambling to protect their networks, such as Saudi Arabia recently announcing a partnership to improve the security of its service.Another operator enhancing the protection of its networks is Tel Aviv's Purple Line light rail transport (LRT), a line currently under construction and due to be open and running by the end of this decade.Dark Reading spoke with Eran Ner Gaon, CISO of Tel Aviv Purple Line LRT, and Shaked Kafzan, co-founder and CTO of rail cybersecurity provider Cervello, about dealing with increased attacks on OT networks.Eran Ner Gaon, CISO of the Tel Aviv Purple LineShaked Kafzan, Co-Founder and CTO of CervelloDark Reading: What steps have you taken to protect your networks from cyberattacks?Eran Ner Gaon: In order to identify OT threats, we developed a comprehensive OT security strategy that includes measures such as threat intelligence, technological measures, incident response plans, and training of employees related to the regulation of the INCD [Israel National Cyber Directorate].From a human point of view, the treatment of OT threats requires extended specialization not only from cybersecurity but a deep familiarity with the worlds of OT and their communication protocols. For this purpose, we require skilled manpower who sits in the control centers with eyes and hands right on the keyboard upon receiving a suspicion of an incident. From a technological point of view, we provide protection at all network layers: physical separation between networks, work environments and microsegmentation; identity management with advanced tools using PAM; [and] establishing a laboratory that simulates the operational activity and adjusting the changes on the system before downloading for execution.DR: Can cyberattacks against OT be thoroughly defended against?Shaked Kafzan: From the perspective of a cybersecurity company, the surge in attacks against OT systems is worrying but expected. What's more worrying is how poorly prepared the critical infrastructure sector is against attacks with potentially fatal or incredibly costly consequences. When the stakes are so high, when the costs are so severe, there is no room for risk. Cybersecurity must be implemented as a means to prevent, not to ""fix.""DR: What is different about rail security from a protection perspective?Kafzan: Cybersecurity for rail and OT must be proactive and continuous. To do this, organizations must implement network segmentation on real network traffic, have strict authentication and access controls, ensure continuous monitoring and detection of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, and stay updated on what is going on in the space, including keeping up with cybersecurity compliance standards.DR: Of course, a reliable patching process and vulnerability management best practices are key to a security strategy. But for an OT organization, what are the issues with patching while keeping systems online?Kafzan: Patching a cybersecurity vulnerability within a rail network is like changing the wheels of a car while it's moving: It's not simple, and, many times, it's not doable. Though we are a cybersecurity provider, our security strategy has to bear in mind the interests of our rail customers, which are high availability and physical safety.This means we must rely on passive yet deeply informative and rail operational contextual solutions that will mitigate a cybersecurity incident and fortify the organization's cybersecurity posture without any interference in its existing infrastructure and systems.DR: Each system comes with its own challenges, so what steps do you take when patching?Goan: Since business continuity is must, we examine any implementation or change in general â€” meaning that first we consider whether the systems support live or hot patching, then we will verify if downtime is required, and what is it [the downtime]? And finally ... we will consider the risk of the repair versus leaving the weak point.In the background of these things, we strengthen our operating concept through a strong and updated laboratory environment for the operational environment that supports many tests of the changes that we want to implement alongside a robust system of backups and procedures that allow us to go back to any point in time before the change was made.DR: As a possible protection option, we've seen AI cited as a key trend for cybersecurity in 2024, in particular in the field of industrial automation. Does this change the way you work, and OT can be better secured?Goan: Along with the many threats that AI poses to us, we receive inherent advantages in the technological tools we have chosen that combine AI capabilities in a fast, efficient, and automatic manner.As we move forward, I predict that the AI capabilities will be able to perform a large number of high-quality and good actions for our systems, but we must remember that in the end there will be hands on the keyboard and a high-quality human response that will be able to prioritize the events.DR: From your position providing security for rail operators, how does AI fit into what you provide?Kafzan: Behind the scenes, AI is more than just a trend, it is an exciting opportunity to more effectively enhance the security of rail systems. It allows us to analyze vast amounts of data while staying continuously updated with the global cybersecurity community's knowledge, in order to quickly identify, respond, and remediate threats in real-time.AI will allow us to predict potential security breaches before they happen, based on patterns it has learned. An immediate benefit of the technologies is its ability to improve operational efficiency, optimize schedules and routes, and enhance passenger experience by providing real-time insights. It can help minimize downtime and extend the lifespan of the existing infrastructure by offering predictions of when parts of the train systems or track are likely to fail or need servicing.Read more about:DR Global Middle East & AfricaAbout the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE

Iran's srael cyber ops tease US election meddling tactics,"Iran's cyber operations in Israel a potential prelude to US election interferenceTactics are more sophisticated and supported in greater numbersIran's anti-Israel cyber operations are providing a window into the techniques the country may deploy in the run-up to the 2024 US Presidential elections, Microsoft says.An analysis of Iran's activity, published by Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) today, concluded that Iran may again target US elections as it did in 2020, using more sophisticated techniques from a wealth of different groups.The main fear for US elections comes from the growing number of pro-Iran and Iran-linked groups carrying out cyberattacks and influence operations since the conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out in October 2023.""Defenders can no longer take solace in tracking a few groups,"" MTAC's report reads. ""Rather, a growing number of access agents, influence groups, and cyber actors makes for a more complex and intertwined threat environment.""Based on Microsoft's threat intelligence data, the US and Israel have consistently been the prime targets for Iran-linked cyberattacks, and the increasing effectiveness and brazenness of those efforts may be a cause for concern as November's election edges closer.Iran's influence operations, for example, pushing anti-Israel propaganda, were shown to be highly effective at reaching Western audiences â€“ a tactic that could feasibly be transposed to the US election too.In the first week of the war between Israel and Hamas, Microsoft spotted a 42 percent spike in traffic to news sites run by or affiliated with the Iranian state.That surge was especially apparent in English-speaking countries such as the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and even though this traffic trailed off after the first week of the war, for three weeks after it remained 28 percent above pre-war levels.These influence operations are well documented already and were spotted early in the conflict, but the effectiveness of the campaigns to reach Western audiences, combined with the increasing number of groups willing to engage in these missions, is a concern.Iran is known for historically taking advantage of channels such as social media for these operations, but for the first time AI played a role, Microsoft said. It pointed to a December hijacking of a streaming TV channel to broadcast fake news reports, presented by an AI-generated human newsreader that reached audiences in the UK, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates.""This marked the first Iranian influence operation Microsoft has detected where AI played a key component in its messaging and is one example of the fast and significant expansion in the scope of Iranian operations since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict.""As for how Iran might wish to act in the months leading up to November's presidential election, we can look back to 2020 for clues.According to a report [PDF] from the US Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the country's main aim was to undermine the reelection prospects of President Trump.The pro-Iran players at work here didn't attempt to jeopardize Trump's campaign through the promotion of his rivals, but instead by sowing division and exacerbating social tensions among US citizens. There was no evidence to suggest that the election itself or its voting systems were tampered with by Iran's campaign.""We have high confidence in this assessment,"" the report reads. ""We assess that Supreme Leader Khamenei authorized the campaign and Iran's military and intelligence services implemented it using overt and covert messaging and cyber operations.""In response, the US indicted two Iranians who both have $10 million bounties on their heads, per the Rewards for Justice program, available to anyone with information leading to their location.Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi and Sajjad Kashian, aged 24 and 27 respectively, are alleged to have stolen US voter data and used it to send threatening emails in a bid to intimidate voters. Among a sprawling list of allegations, they also are said to have breached a US media company's network and would have succeeded in publishing false narratives if the FBI hadn't caught them and alerted the company beforehand.- Uncle Sam wants to make it clear that America's elections are very, very safe- Iranian cyberspies target US defense orgs with a brand new backdoor- Hacktivists boast: We shut down Iran's gas pumps today- US warns Iranian terrorist crew broke into 'multiple' US water facilitiesIran's influence efforts are essentially categorized by the US as those that seek to undermine the legitimacy of its elections and institutions more so than any single candidate. For example, the emails sent to US voters, like those by the two indicted individuals, were mainly designed to spread uncertainty around voter fraud.""We assess that Tehran's efforts to attempt to influence the outcome of the 2020 US election and Iranian officials' preference that former President Trump not be reelected were driven in part by a perception that the regime faced acute threats from the US,"" the DNI report reads.Microsoft believes that all three of the prime suspects for election interference â€“ Iran, Russia, and China â€“ will spin up their respective campaigns in the run-up to this year's election, despite taking a backseat during the 2022 midterms.It may be the first time a US election faces simultaneous interference attempts from multiple authoritarian states, it said.Iran's cyber capabilityIn addition to Iran's methods for conducting influence operations, including the abuse of social media platforms and pushing news content that's seemingly legitimate, Iran has also demonstrated its significant cyber capability in recent attacks in Israel to support its campaign.In addition to pushing the boundaries, poking the US to see what it can get away with, as it has done recently with the attack on its water systems late last year, Iran has engaged in destructive cyber operations akin to those used in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.For example, in addition to taking an Israel-made programmable logic controller offline at a Pennsylvania water authority in November, displaying an anti-Israel message on the screen, Tehran-linked groups such as Shahid Kaveh used ransomware against Israeli CCTV cameras.This took place in October, roughly two weeks into the war, and Shahid Kaveh used one of its personas to claim it breached the CCTV of the Nevatim Air Force base, when in fact it only popped the cameras on a civilian street in Nevatim, not the military base in the same area.As the conflict raged on, Iran's destructive cyber attacks began to grow in scope, including targets such as Bahrain and Albania â€“ both of which have relatively friendly relations with Israel.Albania was the target of attacks from the Homeland Justice group, part of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Homeland Justice warned of impending attacks in November which eventually came on Christmas Day.Government systems were downed by the attacks, while a national airline and telco were also targeted at the same time.Bahrain, on the other hand, was targeted by al-Toufan. Government and financial organizations bore most of the brunt, which is thought to be in large part due to the 2020 signing of the Bahrainâ€“Israel normalization agreement.From the early days of the conflict, the number of pro-Iran groups carrying out cyber operations grew quickly beyond the nine Microsoft initially tracked to 14 by the two-week mark. This then led to greater collaboration among these groups, including between MOIS group Pink Sandstorm and the Lebanon-based, pro-Iran Hezbollah group.""Collaboration lowers the barrier to entry, allowing each group to contribute existing capabilities and removes the need for a single group to develop a full spectrum of tooling or tradecraft,"" said Clint Watts, general manager at MTAC and author of its latest report.""Iranian focus on Israel has intensified. While Israel and the US have always been Tehran's main targets, the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war saw 43 percent of Iranian nation-state cyber activity focused on Israel, more than the next 14 targeted countries combined.""

"Critical Bugs in Canon Printers Allow Code Execution, DDoS","February 6, 2024Canon has patched seven critical buffer-overflow bugs affecting its small office multifunction printers and laser printers.Tracked as CVE-2023-6229 through CVE-2023-6234 (plus CVE-2024-0244), they affect different processes common across Canon's product lines â€“ the username or password process involved with authenticating mobile devices, for example, the Service Location Protocol (SLP) attribute request process, and more.The company assigned them all ""critical"" 9.8 out of 10 ratings on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scale. As explained in a security advisory, they can allow unauthenticated attackers to remotely perform denial of service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution against any affected printers connected directly to the Internet. They also offer a handy pivot point to burrow deeper into victim networks.No exploitations have been observed in the wild as of yet, according to the company's European site, but owners should scan for indicators of compromise given that the bugs have been publicly known but unpatched for months.Hard to Handle: The Problem With Printer SecurityThe seven vulnerabilities patched on Feb. 5 were revealed alongside dozens of others at Pwn2Own Toronto's SOHO Smashup last summer, where contestants were invited to breach routers and then the small office/home office (SOHO) devices they connect to.Printers, so rarely recognized as fertile grounds for cyberattacks, were given their own category at the event.""It's a pretty large attack surface right now that's often overlooked, especially in small businesses, because it's hard to manage from an enterprise level,"" explains Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness for Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), which runs the Pwn2Own hacking contest. ""I mean, it's not like printers have automatic updates or other features that you can use to manage them cleanly and easily.""He adds, ""printers have always been kind of notorious for being finicky. You can go back to Office Space â€” one of the big scenes where they took a baseball bat to the printer. It's a joke, but it's a joke that's based in reality. These things are difficult to manage. The drivers are difficult to manage. And there's a lot of problematic software on them.""As a result, an old office printer â€” connected to other, more sensitive devices in a small or midsized business (SMB) network â€” tends to be rather trivial to crack.""I was a little shocked with how little they had to work on it to find really workable exploits,"" Childs recalls of Pwn2Own Toronto. As a case in point: ""Last year somebody played the Mario theme on a printer. And he said it took him longer to figure out how to play the Mario theme than to exploit the printer.""What SMBs Can Do About Printer Security ChaosBeyond the obvious step of updating to the latest firmware, Canon is advising its customers to ""set a private IP address for the products and create a network environment with a firewall or wired/Wi-Fi router that can restrict network access.""The advice speaks to a larger point: that even if printers are thick and unwieldy, what's manageable is their connectivity.""It used to be that there were, believe it or not, Internet-addressable printers. What businesses have done is they've gotten printers off the Internet, which is a change over the last decade. Now we've got them behind at least a firewall, or router, or something,"" Childs explains.However, he adds, ""as we've seen with PrintNightmare and other printer-based exploits, you can get past that firewall and then attack a printer, then pivot from that to other targets within an enterprise."" To prevent a printer compromise from reaching further into a network, SMBs need to focus on properly segmenting different areas of their networks.The best way to protect the printers themselves, meanwhile, is to patch.

"World Govs, Tech Giants Sign Spyware Responsibility Pledge","February 6, 2024A coalition of dozens of countries including France, the UK, and the US, along with tech giants such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft, have signed a joint agreement to combat the use of commercial spyware in ways that violate human rights.The news comes a day after the United States announced a visa restriction policy for those it deems to be abusing such tools.Commercial spyware, such as NSO Group's Pegasus, is usually installed on iPhones or Android devices and can eavesdrop on phone calls; intercept messaging; take pictures with the cameras; exfiltrate app data, photos, and files; and take voice and video recordings. The tools usually make use of zero-day exploits for initial access and sell for millions of dollars, meaning that their target market tends to consist of global government clients and large commercial interests.For their part, commercial spyware vendors (CSVs) usually position themselves as legitimate companies that aid law enforcement and other public-sector entities in apprehending criminals. Critics, on the other hand, argue that they simply sell cyber weapons to the highest bidders, including repressive regimes looking to surveil members of civil society â€” political opponents, dissidents, journalists, activists, and others. The victims are then targeted for further human-rights abuses, many have alleged, including Google, which today issued a detailed report on the rapidly proliferating CSV market.Pall Mall: Commercial Spyware Under ScrutinyAt a speech at the UK-France Cyber Proliferation conference at Lancaster House in London today, UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden announced the kickoff for the spyware initiative, dubbed the ""Pall Mall Process,"" which will be a ""multi-stakeholder initiative â€¦ to tackle the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercially available cyber-intrusion capabilities,"" he explained.More specifically, the coalition will establish guidelines for developing, selling, facilitating, purchasing, and using these types of tools and services, including defining irresponsible behavior and creating a framework for their transparent and accountable use.He also announced that the UK will invest Â£1 million into the nonprofit Shadowserver Foundation, to ""help them expand the access they provide to early warning systems, and to cyber resilience support for those impacted by cyberattacks.""Dowden noted, ""The scope [of our efforts] must be broad, not just looking at spyware, but also considering the 'hackers for hire' phenomenon, the exploit marketplace, alongside the broader range of 'off the shelf' intrusion capabilities, including tools for disruptive and destructive effect.""Ongoing Anti-Spyware Efforts by GovernmentAccording to Recorded Future, 24 of the 35 states and organizations attending the Lancaster House conference signed the pledge, agreeing to ""engage in an ongoing and globally inclusive dialogue, complementary to other multilateral initiatives,"" with a follow-up meeting set for next year in France.While the full accounting of attendees to the event has not been made public, Recorded Future reported that a range of countries â€” including Cyprus, Greece, Italy, and Singapore â€” all signed the pledge, while Hungary, Mexico, Spain, and Thailand, among others, did not. Israel, which is home to many CSVs, including NSO Group, did not attend the event.This is not the first effort to combat malicious governmental use of commercial spyware; last March, the Biden administration issued an executive order imposing restrictions on its use by federal agencies.""The United States remains concerned with the growing misuse of commercial spyware around the world to facilitate repression, restrict the free flow of information, and enable human rights abuses [which] threatens privacy and freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association,"" US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said in yesterday's announcement on the visa restrictions. ""Such targeting has been linked to arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings in the most egregious of cases,"" likely referring to the Jamal Khashoggi killing in 2018.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Recent SSRF Flaw in Ivanti VPN Products Undergoes Mass Exploitation,"A recently disclosed server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability impacting Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure products has come under mass exploitation.The Shadowserver Foundation said it observed exploitation attempts originating from more than 170 unique IP addresses that aim to establish a reverse shell, among others.The attacks exploit CVE-2024-21893 (CVSS score: 8.2), an SSRF flaw in the SAML component of Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and Neurons for ZTA that allows an attacker to access otherwise restricted resources without authentication.Ivanti had previously divulged that the vulnerability had been exploited in targeted attacks aimed at a ""limited number of customers,"" but cautioned the status quo could change post public disclosure.That's exactly what appears to have happened, especially following the release of a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit by cybersecurity firm Rapid7 last week.The PoC involves fashioning an exploit chain that combines CVE-2024-21893 with CVE-2024-21887, a previously patched command injection flaw, to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution.It's worth noting here that CVE-2024-21893 is an alias for CVE-2023-36661 (CVSS score: 7.5), an SSRF vulnerability present in the open-source Shibboleth XMLTooling library. It was fixed by the maintainers in June 2023 with the release of version 3.2.4.Security researcher Will Dormann further pointed out other out-of-date open-source components used by Ivanti VPN appliances, such as curl 7.19.7, openssl 1.0.2n-fips, perl 5.6.1, psql 9.6.14, cabextract 0.5, ssh 5.3p1, and unzip 6.00, thus opening the door for more attacks.The development comes as threat actors have found a way to bypass Ivanti's initial mitigation, prompting the Utah-based company to release a second mitigation file. As of February 1, 2024, it has begun releasing official patches to address all the vulnerabilities.Last week, Google-owned Mandiant revealed that several threat actors are leveraging CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 to deploy an array of custom web shells tracked as BUSHWALK, CHAINLINE, FRAMESTING, and LIGHTWIRE.Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said it observed 28,474 exposed instances of Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure in 145 countries between January 26 and 30, 2024, with 610 compromised instances detected in 44 countries as of January 23, 2024.The ongoing exploitation of Ivanti flaws has also prompted the European Union, alongside CERT-EU, ENISA, and Europol, to issue a joint advisory urging organizations in the bloc to follow guidance provided by the vendor to mitigate potential risks.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
How to Prepare for Elevated Cybersecurity Risk at the Super Bowl,"February 7, 2024COMMENTARYMajor sporting events such as the Super Bowl are fertile ground for threat actors: They attract huge audiences and offer a treasure trove of valuable data for hackers â€” from payment card data to user credentials that grant access to an organization's network. They also have a large concentration of high-profile targets, including celebrities, media personalities, political dignitaries, and famous athletes.It's not only the volume of targets and data that draw threat actors to these live events. They also create a sense of urgency, one of a hacker's greatest allies. If a threat actor can compromise critical systems, such as ticket entry or on-premises point-of-sale (PoS) payment systems, the venue, event organizers, and vendors may be highly motivated to pay a ransom to restore their systems quickly.Businesses must be extra vigilant in the lead-up to Super Bowl LVIII, as ""for ransom"" threats are increasingly significant. While ransomware is the best known, other ""for ransom"" threats include sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and exfiltration of sensitive or embarrassing data with the threat to disclose it unless the ransom is paid.The Offensive Line-up: Adversary PersonasAs in football, it's important to know your opponents. The adversary's offense can come at you from many angles.Cybercriminals are primarily driven by financial gain, look to monetize exploits quickly, and attack in large volumes. They are among the most prevalent of the threat actor lineup and often start attacking well before the event with social engineering and phishing campaigns to harvest credentials. Then they double down during the event with more destructive actions, including launching ""for ransom"" attacks and deploying information-stealing malware to siphon payment card data from PoS systems.Hacktivists are generally driven by ideology, with website defacement their weapon of choice. These hacktivists are trying to get their message out, and what better time than when the huge Super Bowl audience is watching?Deliberate disruptors typically use DDoS or destructive malware attacks to degrade or disrupt the event experience. Deliberate disruption includes ""for ransom"" activities and disinformation and misinformation campaigns, often using social media and possibly deepfake technologies, to dissuade or persuade their target audience of something (usually nefarious).Nation-state or state-affiliated threat actors are driven by national security, geopolitical positioning, and competitive advantage. These highly sophisticated cyber adversaries are drawn to large events due to their VIP audiences and the types of intelligence they can potentially collect.Don't Underestimate the Home-Team AdvantageWhile it's common to focus on threats from foreign cybercriminal enterprises looking to do harm, don't overlook often-inadvertent threat actors much closer to home.Employees with legitimate access to organizational resources can cause significant (usually unintentional) damage through mistakes and abuse of access privileges.A temporary workforce, brought on to cover increased staffing demand, may have similar access rights as full-time employees, but often undergo less scrutiny or security checks.Vendors and partners with physical or logical access to key resources can be a pivot point for threat actors through supply chain attacks. Vendors and partners are often prime targets for attackers on their own.How Cyber Adversaries Do HarmThe cyber adversary's playbook includes multiple tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).Targeting infrastructure provided by the event venue, city and state governments, and third parties (such as local businesses, sponsors, and hospitality providers). These can degrade or disable services, often with the intent of financial gain through ransomware or DDoS attacks.Increasing in social engineering campaigns using the event or related topics as lures to target and trick victims into giving up information including credentials or clicking links that trigger malware.Disseminating misinformation and disinformation â€” generally for ideology reasons, (geo)political motivation, or competitive advantage.Exfiltrating sensitive data to discredit, bribe, monetize, or coerce victims, often with a ransom demand asking for cryptocurrency payment.Strengthen the Human ElementWith the Super Bowl rolling into town, Las Vegas, already known for hospitality, will see a massive influx of guests. Cybercriminals often use social engineering techniques to target and defraud tourists because they may have a harder time distinguishing between legitimate and malicious communications while outside their normal routines. This makes them especially vulnerable and attractive to cybercriminals.Businesses must also be wary of social engineering in the runup to the ""Big Game."" Even though Las Vegas is home to some of the biggest hospitality brands in the world â€” companies with multimillion dollar cybersecurity budgets â€” social attacks can bypass even the most sophisticated security systems by targeting the biggest vulnerability of all: people.Businesses don't have time to do a complete cybersecurity overhaul ahead of Super Bowl weekend, but they do have time to remind employees of cybersecurity best practices. Social attacks can target virtually any employee, and an educated workforce helps mitigate risk.Employees who learn how to spot the most common social engineering tactics â€” phishing, vishing, smishing, pretexting â€” can help reduce points of entry. Remind employees to change passwords often and not use the same credentials across different systems and websites. If an employee's password has been compromised in another data breach, attackers can use it to gain access to your business.Also have incident response plans in place so that employees know how to respond if a suspicious incident happens. Having a plan can prevent a wider breach. Isolating incidents is just as important as preventing them.Consider Partners WiselyAttackers can also bypass sophisticated cybersecurity systems by targeting third-party vendors. Many major breaches are traced back to vulnerabilities in vendors with valuable data from larger companies. This should be a cause for concern for as Super Bowl event organizers, who work with a vast constellation of third-party vendors. While it's too late to reevaluate vendors now, there may be time to evaluate third-party exposure, touch base with vendor partners, and take measures to mitigate potential risk.Remove Weak LinksAn organization's cybersecurity is only as strong as its weakest links. Strong cybersecurity doesn't depend only on technology solutions; it's also about behaviors and culture. In that sense, cybersecurity is a manifestation of discipline. An organization may have rules to help prevent cyber incidents, but if they're not strictly and uniformly applied, its systems remain vulnerable. Threat actors are unlikely to change their tactics as long as they remain effective. Don't make it easy on them. Implement systems, establish protocols, make plans, and stick to them.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
US says China's Volt Typhoon is readying destructive attacks,"US says China's Volt Typhoon is readying destructive cyberattacks12 international govt agencies sound the alarm, critical infrastructure at the heart of threatsThe US government today confirmed China's Volt Typhoon crew comprised ""multiple"" critical infrastructure orgs' IT networks in America â€“ and Uncle Sam warned that the Beijing-backed spies are readying ""disruptive or destructive cyberattacks"" against those targets.The Chinese team remotely broke into IT environments â€” primarily across communications, energy, transportation systems, and water and wastewater system sectors â€” in the continental and non-continental United States and its territories, including Guam.""Volt Typhoon's choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and the US authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions,"" a dozen Five Eyes government agencies warned on Wednesday.The authoring agencies are: the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), US National Security Agency (NSA), US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), US Department of Energy (DOE), US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Australian Signals Directorate's (ASD's) Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), a part of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), and New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ).According to the US agencies, Volt Typhoon will likely use any network access it can get to pull off disruptive attacks against American systems and equipment in the event of geopolitical tensions or military conflicts.This follows last week's similar warning from FBI Director Christopher Wray that Chinese attackers are preparing to ""wreak havoc"" on American infrastructure, and the Justice Department's disclosure that Volt Typhoon infected ""hundreds"" of outdated Cisco and Netgear equipment with malware in an attempt to break into US critical infrastructure facilities.- Congress told how Chinese goons plan to incite 'societal chaos' in the US- FBI confirms it issued remote kill command to blow out Volt Typhoon's botnet- US shorts China's Volt Typhoon crew targeting America's criticals- Is critical infrastructure prepared for OT ransomware?While the threat to American critical infrastructure appears to be the highest, should US facilities be disrupted, ""Canada would likely be affected as well, due to cross-border integration,"" according to CCCS.Australian and New Zealand critical infrastructure could be vulnerable as well.In addition to sounding the alarm, the government bodies issued a long list of technical details, TTPs observed in the digital break-ins, and detection recommendations and best practices.Plus, there's three actions that owners and operators should take ""today"" to mitigate the threat.These include: Apply patches for internet-facing systems with priority given to appliances that Volt Typhoon likes to exploit.Second: Turn on phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA).And finally, ensure that logging is turned on for applications, access and security logs, and store these logs in a centralized system.

Fulton County Court System Still Hobbled by Cyberattack,"Even clients are having a difficult time searching for information on cases online.February 7, 2024After Fulton County, Georgia, suffered a cyberattack and subsequent power outage at the end of January, leading to malfunctions in court filings, tax processing, and the court system website, there are concerns of the future of Fulton County court cases and its overall system.Criminal defense attorney Joshua Schiffer noted that his job is becoming more strenuous now that dispositions are being held, causing a backlog in cases.It's still unclear if the attack was ransomware or some other disruptive action that's making data access impossible.""We can't do our jobs.

Mozilla adds paid-for data-deletion tier to Monitor service,"Mozilla adds paid-for data-deletion tier to Monitor, its privacy-breach radarFirefox maker promises to lean on personal info brokers to scrub recordsMozilla on Tuesday expanded its free privacy-monitoring service with a paid-for tier called Mozilla Monitor Plus that will try to get data brokers to delete their copies of subscribers' personal information.Mozilla introduced Monitor in 2018 as a way to make people aware when their personal info may have been stolen, leaked, and/or illicitly traded online. Called Firefox Monitor at launch, and now Mozilla Monitor, it provides a service that's not just similar to the venerable HaveIBeenPwned.com â€“ it uses the HIBP database as its source. If your personal info gets stolen or leaked by cybercriminals, and a record of that privacy breach is added to HaveIBeenPwned, Monitor will automatically flag that up to you.Necessarily alert to revenue diversification opportunities in light of its dependence on Google paying to be the default search service on its beleaguered Firefox browser, Mozilla has taken Monitor beyond HIBP alerts, added data removal, and branded that expanded service Monitor Plus with a subscription fee of $8.99 per month (or $107.88 per year).The idea being that, for paying users, Monitor will do what it can to scrub their personal info from recognized data brokers that buy and sell netizens' details and records with other businesses, such as those folks' locations and online habits. While Monitor flags up criminal activity, Monitor Plus deals with removing info from ostensibly legit brokers; we can't imagine the org will have much success persuading underworld fraudsters to remove people's records.â€œWhen we launched Monitor, our goal was to help people discover where their personal info may have been exposed,"" said Tony Amaral-Cinotto, product manager of Mozilla Monitor, in an announcement. ""Now, with Monitor Plus, weâ€™ll help people take back their exposed data from data broker sites that are trying to sell it.""In doing so, Mozilla joins more than a dozen other companies offering similar data removal services targeting a varying number of vendors, such as Abine's DeleteMe ($10.75 per month), Optery ($4-$25 per month), and Incogni ($6.49 per month), among others.These businesses contact data brokers and ask them to remove personal information (e.g. name, email, address, phone number) from their info stores on behalf of netizens, a time-consuming and onerous process if done manually.Mozilla claims Monitor Plus will work with over 190 data broker sites, ""twice the number of other competitors."" As a point of comparison, Opetery's top tier boasts removals from more than 305 sites, though at a cost of more than twice what Mozilla is asking. And that falls well short of the 549 data brokers currently registered in the State of California's Data Broker Registry, to say nothing of firms not doing business in the state or just operating illegally.So Mozilla Monitor Plus is an incomplete, temporary fix â€“ sites may reacquire customer data, necessitating follow-up removal requests â€“ in a largely unregulated data broker business that has made few accommodations to demands for privacy.- Brit watchdog thinks Google's tweaked Privacy Sandbox still isn't cricket- 'I'm sorry for everything...' Facebook's Zuck apologizes to families at Senate hearing- Microsoft Edge ignores user wishes, slurps tabs from Chrome without permission- Amazon Ring sounds death knell for surveillance as a serviceAnd the privacy situation has been grim for a while. A decade ago, in 2014, the FTC called on Congress to do something about the data broker industry. And not a lot has happened since.But by 2018, which saw Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal and the implementation of Europe's 2016 General Data Protection Regulation, demands for data privacy and protection began showing results.A year later, with browser rivals starting to block third-party cookies by default, Google saw the writing on the wall and set about designing its Privacy Sandbox advertising tools for a world grown wary of third-party tracking and data gathering.Lately, info brokers have received a lot of attention â€“ not enough to merit an actual federal privacy law but more than usual for the intervention-averse US. The Federal Trade Commission recently banned X-Mode Social from sharing or selling location data.US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) called for domestic intelligence agencies to stop buying location data. And the Biden Administration is reportedly working on an executive order limiting data brokers from sharing or selling data on Americans to foreign adversaries.But the most significant development in the US in terms of data brokers has been California's Delete Act, which follows on the heels of the California Consumer Privacy Act and the state's Privacy Rights Act.The Delete Act technically became law this year but should start showing its teeth two years from now. Starting January 1, 2026, the California Privacy Protection Agency is supposed to deploy a one-stop data deletion mechanism to allow consumers to request that data brokers stop tracking them and delete their personal info. And by August 1 that year data brokers will be required to process people's deletion requests every 45 days.So two years hence or thereabout, Monitor Plus and related services may not be necessary for those in California â€“ they'll no longer need to pay to recover the privacy taken from them without consent, at least with regard to third-party brokers.A Mozilla spokesperson told The Register the Delete Act is great news for Californians. ""Since the deletion mechanism will not be available until 2026, we wanted to ensure that people could begin protecting their privacy as quickly as possible, especially for people outside California who won't have this state protection,"" the spokesperson said.

Patch Now: Critical TeamCity Bug Allows for Server Takeovers,"February 7, 2024JetBrains has patched a critical security vulnerability in its TeamCity On-Premises server that can allow unauthenticated remote attackers to gain control over an affected server and use it to perform further malicious activity within an organization's environment.TeamCity is a software development lifecycle (SDLC) management platform that about 30,000 organizations â€” including several major brands like Citibank, Nike, and Ferrari â€” use to automate processes to build, test, and deploy software. As such, it's home to scores of data that can be useful to attackers, including source code and signing certificates, and also could allow for tampering with compiled versions software or deployment processes.The flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-23917, presents the weakness CWE-288, which is an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel. JetBrains identified the flaw on Jan. 19; it affects all versions from 2017.1 through 2023.11.2 of its TeamCity On-Premises continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) server.""If abused, the flaw may enable an unauthenticated attacker with HTTP(S) access to a TeamCity server to bypass authentication checks and gain administrative control of that TeamCity server,"" TeamCity's Daniel Gallo wrote in a blog post detailing CVE-2024-23917, published earlier this week.JetBrains already has released an update that addresses the vulnerability, TeamCity On-Premises version 2023.11.3, and also patched its own TeamCity Cloud servers. The company also verified that its own servers were not attacked.TeamCity's History of ExploitationIndeed, TeamCity On-Premises flaws are not to be taken lightly, as the last major flaw discovered in the product spurred a global security nightmare when various state-sponsored actors targeted it to engage in a range of malicious behavior.In that case, a public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for a critical remote code execution (RCE) bug tracked as CVE-2023-42793 â€” found by JetBrains and patched last Sept. 30 â€” triggered near immediate exploitation by two North Korean state-backed threat groups tracked by Microsoft as Diamond Sleet and Onyx Sleet. The groups exploited the flaw to drop backdoors and other implants for carrying out a wide range of malicious activities, including cyber espionage, data theft, and financially motivated attacks.Then in December, APT29 (aka CozyBear, the Dukes, Midnight Blizzard, or Nobelium), the notorious Russian threat group behind the 2020 SolarWinds hack, also pounced on the flaw. In activity tracked by CISA, the FBI, and the NSA, among others, the APT hammered vulnerable servers, using them for initial access to escalate privileges, move laterally, deploy additional backdoors, and take other steps to ensure persistent and long-term access to the compromised network environments.Update or Alternative Mitigation RecommendedHoping to avoid a similar scenario with its latest flaw, JetBrains urged anyone with affected products in their environment to immediately update to the patched version.If this isn't possible, JetBrains also released a security patch plugin that's available for download and can be installed on TeamCity versions 2017.1 through 2023.11.2 that will fix the issue. The company also posted installation instructions online for the plugin to help customers mitigate the issue.TeamCity stressed however that the security patch plugin will only address the vulnerability and not provide other fixes, so customers are highly recommended to install the latest version of TeamCity On-Premises ""to benefit from many other security updates,"" Gallo wrote.Further, if an organization has an affected server that is publicly accessible over the Internet and can't take either of those mitigation steps, JetBrains recommended that the server is made in accessible until the flaw can be mitigated.Considering the history of exploitation when it comes to TeamCity bugs, patching is a necessary and crucial first step that organizations need to take to handle the issue, Brian Contos, CSO at Sevco Security, observes. However, given that there could be Internet-facing servers that a company has lost track of, he suggests further steps may need to be taken to more firmly lock down an IT environment.""It's hard enough to defend the attack surface you know about, but it becomes impossible when there are vulnerable servers that don't show up on your IT asset inventory,"" Contos says. ""Once the patching is taken care of, security teams must turn their attention to a longer-term, more sustainable approach to vulnerability management.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",security updates and patches,security updates and patches,TRUE
Linux Distros Hit by RCE Vulnerability in Shim Bootloader,"February 7, 2024Linux shim, a small piece of code that many major Linux distros use during the secure boot process, has a remote code execution vulnerability in it that gives attackers a way to take complete control of affected systems.All Linux distributions that support Secure Boot, including Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, and SUSE are affected by the flaw, identified as CVE-2023-40547. The flaw is the most severe of six vulnerabilities in Linux shim that its maintainer Red Hat disclosed recently â€” and for which it has issued an update (shim 15.8). Bill Demirkapi, a researcher with Microsoft's Security Response Center who discovered the bug and reported it to Red Hat, has described it as every Linux bootloader signed in the past decade.Out-of-Bounds Write ErrorIn its advisory Red Hat said the bug had to do with the shim boot code trusting attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response. ""This flaw allows an attacker to craft a specific malicious HTTP request, leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive and complete system compromise.""The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and Red Hat had slightly different takes on the severity of the vulnerability and its exploitability. The NVD assigned the bug a near maximum severity rating of 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS 3.1 scale and identified it as something that an attacker could exploit over the network with little complexity and requiring no user interaction or privileges.Red Hat gave the bug a more modest severity score of 8.3 and described it as exploitable only through an adjacent network and involving high attack complexity. It was an assessment that maintainers of the other affected Linux distros shared with Ubuntu, for instance, calling CVE-2023-40547 a ""medium"" severity bug and SUSE assigning it an ""important"" rating which typically is a notch lower than critical.Red Hat explained the different severity scores thusly: ""CVSS scores for open source components depend on vendor-specific factors (e.g. version or build chain). Therefore, Red Hat's score and impact rating can be different from NVD and other vendors."" Both the NVD and Red Hat though agreed on the vulnerability having a high impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.A shim bootloader is basically a small app that loads prior to the main operating system bootloader on Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)-based systems. It acts as a bridge between the UEFI firmware and the main OS bootloaders, which in the case of Linux, is typically GRUB or system-boot. Its function is to verify the main OS bootloader before loading and running it.Multiple Attack VectorsResearchers from software supply chain security vendor Eclypsium identified three different paths that an attacker could take to exploit the vulnerability. One is via a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, where the adversary intercepts HTTP traffic between the victim and the HTTP server that serves the files to support HTTP boot. ""The attacker could be located on any network segment between the victim and the legitimate server.""An attacker with enough privileges on a vulnerable system could also exploit the vulnerability locally by manipulating data in Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) variables or on the EFI partitions. ""This can be accomplished with a live Linux USB stick. The boot order can then be changed such that a remote and vulnerable shim is loaded on the system.""An attacker on the same network as the victim can also manipulate the pre-boot execution environment to chain-load a vulnerable shim bootloader, Eclypsium said. ""An attacker exploiting this vulnerability gains control of the system before the kernel is loaded, which means they have privileged access and the ability to circumvent any controls implemented by the kernel and operating system,"" the vendor noted.Exaggerated Severity?Some security experts, though, perceived the vulnerability as requiring a high degree of complexity and happenstance to exploit. Lionel Litty, chief security architect at Menlo Security, says the exploitation bar is high because the attacker would need to already have gained administrator privileges on a vulnerable device. Or they'd need to be targeting a device that uses network boot and also be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the local network traffic of the targeted device.""According to the researcher who found the vulnerability, a local attacker can modify the EFI partition to modify the boot sequence to then be able to leverage the vulnerability,"" Litty says. ""[But] modifying the EFI partition will require being a fully privileged admin on the victim machine,"" he says.If the device is using network boot and the attacker can do MITM on the traffic, then that's when they can target the buffer overflow. ""They would return a malformed HTTP response that would trigger the bug and give them control over the boot sequence at this point,"" Litty says. He adds that organizations with machines using HTTP boot or pre-boot execution environment (PXE) boot should be concerned, especially if communication with the boot sever is in an environment where an adversary could insert themselves into the middle of traffic.Shachar Menashe, senior director of security research at JFrog, says Red Hat's assessment of the vulnerability's severity is more accurate than NVDs ""over-exaggerated"" score.There are two possible explanations for the discrepancy, he says. ""NVD provided the score based on keywords from the description, and not a thorough analysis of the vulnerability,"" he says. For example, assuming that ""malicious HTTP request"" automatically translates to a network attack vector.NVD may also be alluding to an extremely unlikely worst-case scenario where the victim machine is already configured to boot via HTTP from a server outside the local network and the attacker already has control over this HTTP server. ""This is an extremely unlikely scenario which would cause tons of trouble even unrelated to this CVE,"" Shachar says.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",vulnerability reports,vulnerability reports,TRUE
Critical JetBrains TeamCity On-Premises Flaw Exposes Servers to Takeover - Patch Now,"JetBrains is alerting customers of a critical security flaw in its TeamCity On-Premises continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) software that could be exploited by threat actors to take over susceptible instances.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-23917, carries a CVSS rating of 9.8 out of 10, indicative of its severity.""The vulnerability may enable an unauthenticated attacker with HTTP(S) access to a TeamCity server to bypass authentication checks and gain administrative control of that TeamCity server,"" the company said.The issue impacts all TeamCity On-Premises versions from 2017.1 through 2023.11.2. It has been addressed in version 2023.11.3. An unnamed external security researcher has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on January 19, 2024.Users who are unable to update their servers to version 2023.11.3 can alternately download a security patch plugin to apply fixes for the flaw.""If your server is publicly accessible over the internet and you are unable to take one of the above mitigation steps immediately, we recommend temporarily making it inaccessible until mitigation actions have been completed,"" JetBrains advised.While there is no evidence that the shortcoming has been abused in the wild, a similar flaw in the same product (CVE-2023-42793, CVSS score: 9.8) came under active exploitation last year within days of public disclosure by multiple threat actors, including ransomware gangs and state-sponsored groups affiliated with North Korea and Russia.",vulnerability reports,security updates and patches,FALSE
"Critical Patches Released for New Flaws in Cisco, Fortinet, VMware Products","Cisco, Fortinet, and VMware have released security fixes for multiple security vulnerabilities, including critical weaknesses that could be exploited to perform arbitrary actions on affected devices.The first set from Cisco consists of three flaws â€“ CVE-2024-20252 and CVE-2024-20254 (CVSS score: 9.6) and CVE-2024-20255 (CVSS score: 8.2) â€“ impacting Cisco Expressway Series that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.All the issues, which were found during internal security testing, stem from insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface that could permit an attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.""If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts,"" Cisco said about CVE-2024-20252 and CVE-2024-20254.On the other hand, successful exploitation of CVE-2024-20255 targeting a user with administrative privileges could enable the threat actor to overwrite system configuration settings, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Another crucial difference between the two sets of flaws is that while the former two affect Cisco Expressway Series devices in the default configuration, CVE-2024-20252 only impacts them if the cluster database (CDB) API feature has been enabled. It's disabled by default.Patches for the vulnerabilities are available in Cisco Expressway Series Release versions 14.3.4 and 15.0.0.Fortinet, for its part, has released a second round of updates to address what are bypasses for a previously disclosed critical flaw (CVE-2023-34992, CVSS score: 9.7) in FortiSIEM supervisor that could result in the execution of arbitrary code, according to Horizon3.ai researcher Zach Hanley.It's worth noting that Fortinet resolved another variant of CVE-2023-34992 by closing out CVE-2023-36553 (CVSS score: 9.3) in November 2023. The two new vulnerabilities are/will be plugged in the following versions -- FortiSIEM version 7.1.2 or above- FortiSIEM version 7.2.0 or above (upcoming)- FortiSIEM version 7.0.3 or above (upcoming)- FortiSIEM version 6.7.9 or above (upcoming)- FortiSIEM version 6.6.5 or above (upcoming)- FortiSIEM version 6.5.3 or above (upcoming), and- FortiSIEM version 6.4.4 or above (upcoming)Completing the trifecta is VMware, which has warned of five moderate-to-important severity flaws in Aria Operations for Networks (formerly vRealize Network Insight) -- CVE-2024-22237 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a console user to gain regular root access- CVE-2024-22238 (CVSS score: 6.4) - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows a malicious actor with admin privileges to inject malicious code into user profile configurations- CVE-2024-22239 (CVSS score: 5.3) - Local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a console user to gain regular shell access- CVE-2024-22240 (CVSS score: 4.9) - Local file read vulnerability that allows a malicious actor with admin privileges to access sensitive information- CVE-2024-22241 (CVSS score: 4.3) - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows a malicious actor with admin privileges to inject malicious code and take over the user accountTo mitigate the risks, all users of VMware Aria Operations for Networks version 6.x are being recommended to upgrade to version 6.12.0.Considering the history of exploitation when it comes to Cisco, Fortinet, and VMware flaws, patching is a necessary and crucial first step that organizations need to take to handle the shortcomings.",security updates and patches,security updates and patches,TRUE
US snares bug hunter for alleged multimillion Apple fraud,"Cybercrime duo accused of picking $2.5M from Apple's orchardSecurity researcher buddies allegedly tag team a four-month virtual gift card heist at Cupertino tech giantA cybersecurity researcher and his pal are facing charges in California after they allegedly defrauded an unnamed company, almost certainly Apple, out of $2.5 million.Noah Roskin-Frazee and Keith Latteri are alleged to have gained access to Apple's systems via a third-party contractor and ordered gift cards and hardware to the value of $2.5 million and $100,000 respectively.They are then said to have sold their stolen wares to third parties, cashing out on their theft and defrauding both Apple and the customer support business it contracted out of millions.While Apple isn't explicitly named in the recently unsealed court papers, it's not difficult to deduce that the identity of ""Company A,"" as written in the indictment, is the consumer tech megacorp.""Company A was a corporation headquartered in Cupertino, California, which developed, manufactured, licensed, supported, and sold computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and services,"" the indictment reads, describing Company A. Seems pretty Apple-y so far.Looking deeper into the case background, it's also revealed that one of the defendants redeemed one of the stolen gift cards to their personal app store account, where they purchased Final Cut Pro â€“ software developed by Apple that only runs on Apple hardware.Roskin-Frazee and Latteri were able to order the glut of gift cards and hardware because they had access to a number of key Apple backend systems.One of these is a Log Program that allows customer support to search Apple products and order replacements. Another is the Toolbox program which allows customer support staff to edit orders for a limited time after they're made.The final important system at play here is the Jamf MDM platform, which is operated by the third-party contractor and allows configuration changes to be made to Apple devices, but that's not what it was used for in this case.How the scam unfoldedThe first port of call was gaining access to the contractor's systems. The pair allegedly did this by using what the court papers [PDF] describe as a password reset tool on a targeted account. From there, the pair used that first compromised account to unearth credentials for other staff accounts that, crucially, also had credentials for the company's VPN servers.Once connected to the customer support contractor's VPN, they could also access the company's remote desktop software, which they used to control computers owned by the contractor that were located in India and Costa Rica. The contractor's Jamf MDM platform was used to access these computers and log them into desktop sharing sessions.Malicious scripts were run to create a reverse SSH tunnel between the Indian and Costa Rican computers and the accused's Microsoft Azure account, which allowed continued remote access between around December 2018 and March 2019.These remotely operated computers, run using the contractor's legitimate credentials and VPN server, were used to gain access to what the court documents describe as ""Company A's Connect application,"" which is probably Apple's App Store Connect. With this access, Roskin-Frazee and Latteri were able to take control of Toolbox and manipulate orders, it is alleged.After the pair and their family members, using fake names and email addresses, placed more than two dozen orders through Apple, Roskin-Frazee and Latteri allegedly used Toolbox to make critical order amendments during the short window of opportunity. These included extending existing service contracts, adding more products to the orders, and changing all prices to zero.- Verizon says 63K employees' info fell into the wrong hands â€“ an insider this time- Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong acquitted of stock manipulation charges- Fujitsu finance chief says sorry for IT giant's role in Post Office Horizon scandal- SolarWinds slams SEC lawsuit against it as 'unprecedented' victim blamingTransshipment companies Shipito LLC and Amboy Technologies LLC were used to ship the products while concealing the pair's addresses â€“ another means of hiding their identities. Amboy was the first port of call, but the fake account the pair created with the company was terminated due to fraud concerns. However, they later allegedly had more success using Shipito.Apple says 'thanks'?Funnily enough, in a December 2023 security update â€“ published one day before Roskin-Frazee's indictment â€“ Apple acknowledged the security researcher, and his colleague ""Prof. J."" of ZeroClicks Lab, for reporting a bug affecting macOS Ventura that could have allowed an app to access data from a user's contacts.The issue is tracked as CVE-2023-42894 â€“ not the most serious bug in the world but serves as a rare oddity in the world of cybercrime where it's highly unusual for an alleged criminal to be thanked for ethical research after they had spent months allegedly defrauding the very same company years earlier.Roskin-Frazee was also solely credited with the finding of CVE-2023-38593, a denial of service vulnerability impacting iOS and iPadOS earlier in July 2023.Roskin-Frazee was a legitimate, recognized security researcher who had also led talks at conferences such as ISACA's Digital Trust World Europe Conference in Dublin last year.Neither Apple nor the lawyers for Roskin-Frazee and Latteri immediately responded to requests for comment.

'Ov3r_Stealer' Malware Spreads Through Facebook to Steal Crates of Info,"A tangled web of attackers use various social media tactics to propagate the novel threat, which has several execution methods and exfiltrates data to Telegram.February 8, 2024A novel stealer malware called ""Ov3r_Stealer"" is making the rounds on Facebook, spreading through job ads and accounts on the social media platform, and using various execution methods to steal reams of data from unwitting victims.The malware by design exfiltrates specific types of data such as geolocation (based on IP), hardware info, passwords, cookies, credit card information, auto-fills, browser extensions, crypto wallets, Office documents, and antivirus product information, according to researchers from Trustwave SpiderLabs. It sends the info a Telegram channel being monitored by the threat actors.The researchers first discovered the stealer in early December. It was being spread via a Facebook job advertisement for an account manager position, they revealed in a blog post and report published this week. Later, they discovered that the actors behind the malware also use Facebook-based scams â€” including the creation of fake accounts â€” to spread the malware.Eventually, weaponized links delivered through the ad lead to a malicious Discord content-delivery URL, which executed the stealer using a PowerShell script masquerading as a Windows Control Panel (CPL) binary to download the malware, in the form of three files from a GitHub site.But what really sets Ov3r_Stealer apart is having several execution methods. In addition to the PowerShell vector, Ov3r_Stealer also can be executed on a victim's machine via HTML smuggling, SVG image smuggling, and .LNK shortcut files masquerading as innocuous text documents.Down the Cyberattacker Rabbit HoleOnce researchers followed the stolen data to Telegram, they found a rather complex origin story behind Ov3r_Stealer, as the malware appears to have a range of threat actors behind it who conspire via multiple communication channels and platforms.Specifically, the researchers uncovered various pseudonyms, communication channels, and repositories for the stolen data that hold clues to who's behind it and how they work.""Aliases such as 'Liu Kong,' 'MR Meta,' MeoBlackA, and 'John Macollan' were found in groups like 'Pwn3rzs Chat,' 'Golden Dragon Lounge,' 'Data Pro,' and 'KGB Forums,' where many 'researchers,' threat actors, and curious folk gather, meetup, and exchange hacks, malware, and cracked software daily,"" according to the report.It's unknown exactly how attackers use the data once it's stolen, but possibilities including selling it or using it for phishing. To boot, Ov3r_Stealer can also be used in a modular way as a dropper for other malware or post-exploit tools, up to and including ransomware, the researchers said.Ov3r_Stealer's Various Execution StrategiesAs mentioned, once a victim is compromised, the stealer uses several unique execution methods; the researchers observed one and gleaned a few others from sample code. One loader used Windows CPL files â€” which are generally used for system settings within Windows â€” to run a remote PowerShell script to download the malware's three files.Another method indicated by sample data is through HTML smuggling, which uses a weaponized HTML file, CustomCursor.html, to load the CustomCursor.zip file that includes the malware files.A third execution method is through a shortcut file (.LNK). The victim is presented with a file masquerading as a typical text file called Attitude_Reports.txt, located within a zip archive. The actual file within the zip archive, however, is a malicious .LNK file called Attitude_Reports.txt.lnk. Once opened, it will redirect the victim to the GitHub repository, as the CPL loader does, to download the actual payload.Attackers also use a technique called SVG smuggling to execute the file in a method that exploits the WinRAR Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2023-38831). This method works similarly to HTML smuggling, except that the malicious files are embedded within a vector graphics file (SVG). This redirects to a â€œCopyright_Report.svg"" file that, once opened, embeds and loads a .RAR file that contains a Windows .LNK shortcut file to download a PowerShell script to deliver the payload.That final payload is ultimately delivered in three files that are nested: WerFaultSecure.exe, a legitimate Windows executable; Wer.dll, a malicious file that WerFaultSecure loads; and Secure.pdf, which contains malicious code that Wer.dll will load.Once executed, the malware will establish persistence through the copying of its files to the C:\Users\Public\Libraries\Books folder and the creation of a Windows scheduled task called ""Licensing2"" which runs every 90 minutes to ensure continuous data exfiltration.A Malware Poised to Go BigThough Trustwave has not yet seen wide-ranging campaigns using this malware, the researchers believe it remains under continual development and continues to pose an existing threat. They included a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) in their report to help organizations identify the malware in their environment.""As Ov3r_Stealer has been actively developed with multiple loader techniques, we may see this one eventually be sold or used in other campaigns in the future,"" according to the report.To avoid compromise or mitigate attacks by Ov3r_Stealer, Trustwave recommended that organizations implement ""active and engaging"" security awareness programs to help people spot malicious campaigns on social media and other attacker strategies.Organizations also should use regular application and service audits and baselining, as well as practice up-to-date application patching to mitigate threats, the researchers added. Further, they should continuously hunt threats throughout their environments to pick up undetected compromises before they have time to do damage, they added.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Unified Identity â€“ look for the meaning behind the hype!,"If you've listened to software vendors in the identity space lately, you will have noticed that ""unified"" has quickly become the buzzword that everyone is adopting to describe their portfolio. And this is great! Unified identity has some amazing benefits!However (there is always a however, right?) not every ""unified"" ""identity"" ""security"" ""platform"" is made equal. Some vendors call the combination of workforce IDaaS and customer IDaaS a unified identity solution, while others offer a glorified 2FA service â€“ unified only in the mind of their marketers.Your landscape matters!So forget for a moment what the vendors claim, and think back to your organization and your identity security landscape. Consider this new definition: ""unified"" is what has the ability to consolidate your identity challenges with a complete identity solution.Here's an example: you're responsible for the identity infrastructure of a large hospital. Frontline workers, administrative employees, audit/compliance needs and a large number of external users. You are using Active Directory, and your LOB application doesn't do identity. For this hospital, unified identity means strong access management for customers and frontline workers, strong joiner-leaver-mover handling, AD hardening and enterprise-grade reporting. Anything less fails the unified promise and means their internal identity landscape stays fractured.Another example: a small software dev studio. They need extra strong controls on Privileged Access Management (PAM) to protect the development pipeline and make sure they won't become the initial attack vector in a supply chain attack. But they also need Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) for machine entities and their owners, working on the many automated tasks they are running. A solution which covers PAM and IGA independently from each other is not unified.What is the value of unified identity anyways?So why has ""unified identity "" become such a hot buzzword? Well, there are some really good arguments for it. Traditionally, the identity space was very fractured, with many experts not even considering it a singular market until fairly recently. Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), Access Management (AM), and Privileged Access Management (PAM) were the key sub-markets, with a wide array of adjacent spaces such as AD bridging and endpoint privilege management.The key driver for unified identity is this extreme fragmentation: a large organization has on average 45 different security tools. Add to this the identity sprawl, a trend where organizations keep getting more and more identity silos in-house â€“ a One Identity survey shows half the organizations are using more than 25 different systems to manage access rights. This is simply not sustainable, and adding a new tool each time a new threat approaches is completely unworkable. So organizations are looking to consolidate vendors, reduce complexity and slim down the number of suppliers they work with. The benefits of a Unified Identity Platform are a better cybersecurity posture and greater resilience in the face of security threats, whilst increasing simplicity and enabling agility.Another reason is top line cost: bundles, volume discounts and ELAs are a simple way to reduce costs. Vendor consolidation also brings some less obvious savings too: a single tech stack helps the skills gap, easing the stress on hiring and training, which in turn means significant savings on headcount and may lessen the requirement for highly trained senior staff, creating more value from security with less resources or put another way, working smarter not harder.Integration is a key aspect of the identity landscape â€“ and one of the largest headaches. Security tools need to work together smoothly, but that's rarely a given. The industry is not keen on common standards, which makes interoperability very hard to achieve. With some effort (meaning customization, support hours and overhead) identity solutions can work together pairwise, but creating a complete ecosystem of identity tools that work flawless together is a rare achievement. It's easy to see the value a unified identity platform brings here. The tools are pre-tested, pre-validated to work together, usually without any customization required, and the platform components are supported as one by the vendor.This brings us to the final benefit: faster time to value, an expression worthy of any MBA graduate. Identity and access management (IAM) projects are famous for taking a long time to implement, as specialists meticulously formalize business processes and implement them in code or configuration. In large organizations, this is an incredibly complex task, as the IAM setup needs to mirror every aspect (and quirk) the business has built up â€“ sometimes over decades. Implementations become so complex that they just fail â€“ the cost and time overruns exceeding the patience of business leaders. In a nutshell: time to value matters in IAM. And a unified identity solution removes the complexity of the multi-vendor approach, eliminating at least one factor.After these benefits, let's talk a downside: vendor lock-in. Unified identity sounds wonderful but betting the house on a single vendor is a high ask. And what if you already have some solutions in place that you're happy with? It's important to remember that not all unified identity vendors are the same; Some vendors offer modular identity platforms which allow you to keep what you want and unify what you need. This approach enables customers to start the unification at any point (for example with PAM) without the need to embrace and implement all areas in one giant leap. When picking vendors, look for this flexible approach.",marketing,marketing,TRUE

New Fortinet RCE flaw in SSL VPN likely exploited in attacks,"Fortinet is warning that a new critical remote code execution vulnerability in FortiOS SSL VPN is potentially being exploited in attacks.The flaw (tracked as CVE-2024-21762 / FG-IR-24-015) received a 9.6 severity rating and is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in FortiOS that allows unauthenticated attackers to gain remote code execution (RCE) via maliciously crafted requests.To patch the bug, Fortinet recommends upgrading to one of the latest version based on this table:|Version|Affected|Solution|FortiOS 7.6|Not affected|Not Applicable|FortiOS 7.4|7.4.0 through 7.4.2|Upgrade to 7.4.3 or above|FortiOS 7.2|7.2.0 through 7.2.6|Upgrade to 7.2.7 or above|FortiOS 7.0|7.0.0 through 7.0.13|Upgrade to 7.0.14 or above|FortiOS 6.4|6.4.0 through 6.4.14|Upgrade to 6.4.15 or above|FortiOS 6.2|6.2.0 through 6.2.15|Upgrade to 6.2.16 or above|FortiOS 6.0|6.0 all versions|Migrate to a fixed releaseFor those unable to apply patches, you can mitigate the flaw by disabling SSL VPN on your FortiOS devices.Fortinet's advisory does not provide any details on how the vulnerability is being exploited or who discovered the vulnerability.This flaw was disclosed today along with CVE-2024-23113 (Critical/9.8 rating), CVE-2023-44487 (Medium), and CVE-2023-47537 (Medium). However, these flaws are not marked as being exploited in the wild.Threat actors commonly target Fortinet flaws to breach corporate networks for ransomware attacks and cyber espionage.Yesterday, Fortinet disclosed that Chinese state-sponsored threat actors known as Volt Typhoon targeted FortiOS vulnerabilities to deploy custom malware known as COATHANGER.This malware is a custom remote access trojan (RAT) designed to infect Fortigate network security appliances and was recently found used in attacks on the Dutch Ministry of Defence.Due to the high severity of the newly disclosed CVE-2024-21762 flaw and the likelihood of it being exploited in attacks, it is strongly advised that you update your devices as soon as possible.CommentsNocturnal - 23 hours agoAre there any ioc published yet?",vulnerability reports,security updates and patches,FALSE
Raspberry Robin Malware Upgrades with Discord Spread and New Exploits,"The operators of Raspberry Robin are now using two new one-day exploits to achieve local privilege escalation, even as the malware continues to be refined and improved to make it stealthier than before.This means that ""Raspberry Robin has access to an exploit seller or its authors develop the exploits themselves in a short period of time,"" Check Point said in a report this week.Raspberry Robin (aka QNAP worm), first documented in 2021, is an evasive malware family that's known to act as one of the top initial access facilitators for other malicious payloads, including ransomware.Attributed to a threat actor named Storm-0856 (previously DEV-0856), it's propagated via several entry vectors, including infected USB drives, with Microsoft describing it as part of a ""complex and interconnected malware ecosystem"" with ties to other e-crime groups like Evil Corp, Silence, and TA505.Raspberry Robin's use of one-day exploits such as CVE-2020-1054 and CVE-2021-1732 for privilege escalation was previously highlighted by Check Point in April 2023.The cybersecurity firm, which detected ""large waves of attacks"" since October 2023, said the threat actors have implemented additional anti-analysis and obfuscation techniques to make it harder to detect and analyze.""Most importantly, Raspberry Robin continues to use different exploits for vulnerabilities either before or only a short time after they were publicly disclosed,"" it noted.""Those one-day exploits were not publicly disclosed at the time of their use. An exploit for one of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-36802, was also used in the wild as a zero-day and was sold on the dark web.""A report from Cyfirma late last year revealed that an exploit for CVE-2023-36802 was being advertised on dark web forums in February 2023. This was seven months before Microsoft and CISA released an advisory on active exploitation. It was patched by the Windows maker in September 2023.Raspberry Robin is said to have started utilizing an exploit for the flaw sometime in October 2023, the same month a public exploit code was made available, as well as for CVE-2023-29360 in August. The latter was publicly disclosed in June 2023, but an exploit for the bug did not appear until September 2023.It's assessed that the threat actors purchase these exploits rather than developing them in-house owing to the fact that they are used as an external 64-bit executable and are not as heavily obfuscated as the malware's core module.""Raspberry Robin's ability to quickly incorporate newly disclosed exploits into its arsenal further demonstrates a significant threat level, exploiting vulnerabilities before many organizations have applied patches,"" the company said.One of the other significant changes concerns the initial access pathway itself, leveraging rogue RAR archive files containing Raspberry Robin samples that are hosted on Discord.Also modified in the newer variants is the lateral movement logic, which now uses PAExec.exe instead of PsExec.exe, and the command-and-control (C2) communication method by randomly choosing a V3 onion address from a list of 60 hardcoded onion addresses.""It starts with trying to contact legitimate and well-known Tor domains and checking if it gets any response,"" Check Point explained. ""If there is no response, Raspberry Robin doesn't try to communicate with the real C2 servers.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE

Raspberry Pi Pico cracks BitLocker in under a minute,"Windows encryption feature defeated by $10 and a YouTube tutorialWe're very familiar with the many projects in which Raspberry Pi hardware is used, from giving old computers a new lease of life through to running the animated displays so beloved by retailers. But cracking BitLocker? We doubt the company will be bragging too much about that particular application.The technique was documented in a YouTube video over the weekend, which demonstrated how a Raspberry Pi Pico can be used to gain access to a BitLocker-secured device in under a minute, provided you have physical access to the device.A Lenovo laptop was used in the video, posted by user stacksmashing, although other hardware will also be vulnerable. The technique also relies on having a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) separate from the CPU. In many cases, the two will be combined, in which case the technique shown cannot be used.However, if you get your hands on a similarly vulnerable device secured with BitLocker, gaining access to the encrypted storage appears embarrassingly simple. The crux of it is sniffing out the key to the device as it is passed from TPM to CPU. The key is helpfully not encrypted.This particular laptop had connections that could be put to use alongside a custom connector to access the signals between chips. Stir in an analyzer running on the Raspberry Pi Pico and for less than $10 in components, you can get hold of the master key for the laptop hardware.- Raspberry Pi on IPO plans: 'We want to be ready when the markets are ready'- Techie resurrects teletext on a vintage BBC Master- Eben Upton on Sinclair, Acorn, and the Raspberry Pi- Raspberry Pi sizes up HAT+ spec for future hardware add-onsMicrosoft has long accepted that such attacks are possible, although it describes them as a ""targeted attack with plenty of time; the attacker opens the case, solder, and uses sophisticated hardware or software.""At less than a minute in the example, we'd dispute the ""plenty of time"" claim, and while the Raspberry Pi Pico is undoubtedly impressive for the price, at less than $10, the hardware spend is neither expensive nor specific.If your hardware is vulnerable, mitigation can be achieved through the use of a PIN.It's enough to send administrators scurrying to their inventory lists to check for hardware they would be forgiven for assuming had been safely encrypted.As one wag observed: ""Congratulations!

Fake app impersonating LastPass spotted in Apple's App Store,"Fake LastPass lookalike made it into Apple App StoreNo walled garden can keep out every weed, we supposeLastPass says a rogue application impersonating its popular password manager made it past Apple's gatekeepers and was listed in the iOS App Store for unsuspecting folks to download and install.The software maker went public about the fake mobile app on Wednesday, warning that the knockoff ""LastPass Password Manager,"" developed by someone calling themselves Parvati Patel, appeared to be trying to confuse users into running the thing and possibly steal their data or credentials.A screenshot of the fake LastPass app in the Apple App store. Note the misspellings, incorrect developer name and single rating ... Click to enlarge""Upon seeing the fake 'LassPass' app in the Apple App store, LastPass immediately began a coordinated and multi-faceted approach across our threat intelligence, legal and engineering teams to get the fraudulent app removed,"" Christofer Hoff, chief secure technology officer for LastPass, told The Register Thursday.""We are in direct contact with representatives from Apple, and they have confirmed receipt of our complaints, and we are working through the process to have the fraudulent app removed,"" Hoff added.Cupertino may have been on the case but earlier today the app was still available in the store. El Reg asked Apple why the fake LastPass app was still up, and while we didn't receive a response, the app's URL stopped working and the application disappeared from App Store search results on an iPhone within a few minutes of our email.In other words, it's now gone.How'd this weed make it into the walled garden?Apps of questionable value aside, Apple has a reputation for being a relatively safe place for the average iPerson to get their software, with a notoriously tough app approval process standing between developers and users.Apple even updated its developer agreement and review guidelines last year to add a specific prohibition on apps that impersonate others. The design section of the app review guidelines even calls out developers who take such an approach, though it's more concerned with laziness than maliciousness.""Come up with your own ideas,"" Apple demands from developers. ""Submitting apps which impersonate other apps or services is considered a violation of the Developer Code of Conduct and may result in removal from the Apple Developer Program.""Of course, the system isn't perfect, and the occasional weed gets through the wall and into the garden. LastPass' impersonator isn't the first, though it is a particularly egregious case.- Forcing Apple to allow third-party app stores isn't enough- Beware cool-looking beta crypto-apps. They may be money-stealing fakes- Almost 300 predatory loan apps found in Google and Apple stores- Over a million Android users fooled by fake WhatsApp app in official Google Play StoreWhile it's understandable some questionable IP theft could occur on the App Store on occasion, this is a total impersonation of a well-known brand. We'd love to know how this blunder happened, though we're unlikely to get an answer. LastPass wants to know too.""[We're] working with Apple to understand more broadly how an application like this passed their normally rigorous security and brand protection mechanisms,"" Hoff told us. ""The naming convention, the iconography and the description of the fraudulent app are all heavily borrowed from LastPass, and this appears to be a deliberate attempt to target LastPass users.""Separating the apps from the trapsEven with its insistence that opening the App Store to competition would lead to greater threats to user safety, Apple's content rules still aren't completely solid. While we're confident that our readers know well how to spot a fake app from a real one, it's worth reminding everyone how to avoid being tricked into downloading a fake - and this fake LastPass app is rife with examples.There's the obvious signs, like misspellings in app descriptions or in screenshots. The fake LastPass app, screenshotted in this story, actually shows a preview image telling users they can ""store all your passwords with lasspass"" - a good way to tell you're dealing with a faker, assuming legitimate developers have an editor.There's also the developer name, which in LastPass' case should be ""LogMeIn, Inc.,"" not a random person. Other apps from big providers (the most obvious ones to be targeted for impersonation) should likewise match the actual company behind the product.The fake LastPass app also only showed itself as having a single five-star rating, while the real LastPass app has some 52k reviews. A legitimate app is unlikely please everyone, either, and LastPass is no different - the real app is rated 4.4 out of five stars.Additionally, four one-star reviews on the fake LastPass app that didn't seem to affect its overall score came from users warning that it was a scam, so there's two lessons to learn here: Pay attention to the number of reviews on a supposedly legitimate app, and give them a read, too.Along with those elements, look at the age of the app, and also take a look at the app privacy report baked into every page in the App Store - if an app doesn't seem like it needs to link certain types of data to you (sudoku doesn't need to access user content or know your location), then skip it - even if legit the developer might be selling your data.As high as they may be, the walls around Tim's garden can't keep out all the garbage, so be careful.

Microsoft unveils new 'Sudo for Windows' feature in Windows 11,"Microsoft introduced 'Sudo for Windows' today, a new Windows 11 feature allowing users to execute commands with elevated privileges from unelevated terminals.""Sudo for Windows is a new way for users to run elevated commands directly from an unelevated console session,"" said Windows Product Manager Jordi Adoumie.""It is an ergonomic and familiar solution for users who want to elevate a command without having to first open a new elevated console.""The new Sudo tool is rolling out to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels running Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26052.""This project is not a fork of the Linux sudo project, nor is it a port of the Linux sudo project. Instead, Sudo for Windows is a Windows-specific implementation of the sudo concept,"" Microsoft explains.""As the two are entirely different applications, you'll find that certain elements of the Linux sudo experience are not present in Sudo for Windows, and vice versa.""Since Linux sudo and Sudo for Windows are different beasts, scripts written for Linux sudo may not work with Sudo for Windows without some (heavy?) modification.Those who want to enable the sudo command on their system have to go to Settings > For Developers page in the Windows Settings app and toggle the ""Enable Sudo"" option.It can be configured to run applications in a new elevated console window, in the same window but with input disabled, or inline (the new elevated process takes input and routes output to the current window).After elevating a new process using sudo, a UAC dialog will appear to ask the user for confirmation and escalate privileges once confirmed, using the configuration option the user selected.Microsoft says the setting for enabling sudo may incorrectly show up on Windows Server Insider Preview builds. However, sudo will not be available on Windows Server, and this setting will be disabled in a future Server Insider Preview build.Sudo for Windows was accidentally revealed by Microsoft two weeks ago, together with some other in-development features, and was first spotted by Albacore while looking into changes added to updated language packs included with a leaked Windows Server 2025 Insider preview build.""Over the coming months we will be working on expanding documentation for Sudo for Windows and will be sharing more details about the security implications of running sudo in the 'Inline' configuration,"" Adoumie said.""Our team is working on open-sourcing Sudo for Windows and we're excited to share more details about our plans in the coming months.""Commentswpontius - 1 day agoUnneeded , Windows already has ways to run with elevated privileges.

Kimsuky's New Golang Stealer 'Troll' and 'GoBear' Backdoor Target South Korea,"The North Korea-linked nation-state actor known as Kimsuky is suspected of using a previously undocumented Golang-based information stealer called Troll Stealer.The malware steals ""SSH, FileZilla, C drive files/directories, browsers, system information, [and] screen captures"" from infected systems, South Korean cybersecurity company S2W said in a new technical report.Troll Stealer's links to Kimsuky stem from its similarities to known malware families, such as AppleSeed and AlphaSeed malware that have been attributed to the group.Kimsuky, also tracked under the names APT43, ARCHIPELAGO, Black Banshee, Emerald Sleet (previously Thallium), Nickel Kimball, and Velvet Chollima, is well known for its propensity to steal sensitive, confidential information in offensive cyber operations.In late November 2023, the threat actors were sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for gathering intelligence to further North Korea's strategic objectives.S2W's latest analysis reveals the use of a dropper that masquerades as a security program installation file from a South Korean company named SGA Solutions to launch the stealer, which gets its name from the path ""D:/~/repo/golang/src/root.go/s/troll/agent"" that's embedded in it.""The dropper runs as a legitimate installer alongside the malware, and both the dropper and malware are signed with a valid, legitimate D2Innovation Co.,LTD' certificate, suggesting that the company's certificate was actually stolen,"" the company said.A stand-out feature of Troll Stealer is its ability to pilfer the GPKI certificates issued by the South Korean government from infected systems, indicating that the malware may been put to use in attacks targeting administrative and public organizations in the country.Given the absence of Kimsuky campaigns documenting the theft of GPKI folders, it has raised the possibility that the new behavior is either a shift in tactics or the work of another threat actor closely associated with the group that also has access to the source code of AppleSeed and AlphaSeed.There are also signs that the threat actor may be involved with a Go-based backdoor codenamed GoBear that's also signed with a legitimate certificate associated with D2Innovation Co., LTD and executes instructions received from a command-and-control (C2) server.""The strings contained in the names of the functions it calls have been found to overlap with the commands used by BetaSeed, a C++-based backdoor malware used by the Kimsuky group,"" S2W said. ""It is noteworthy that GoBear adds SOCKS5 proxy functionality, which was not previously supported by the Kimsuky group's backdoor malware.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Raspberry Robin devs are buying exploits for faster attacks,"One of most important malware loaders to cybercrims who are jumping on vulnerabilities faster than everResearchers suspect the criminals behind the Raspberry Robin malware are now buying exploits for speedier cyberattacks.An exploit developer is thought by infosec pros to be either on the Raspberry Robin payroll or a close contact that sells them to the group â€“ most likely the latter. That's according to Check Point Research (CPR) which has tracked how long it takes for vulnerability exploits to be added as features to the malware.It means the criminals behind it are prioritizing the speed of development to maximize their chances of successful attacks.""Raspberry Robin continues to use different exploits for vulnerabilities either before or only a short time after they were publicly disclosed,"" said CPR. ""Those one-day exploits were not publicly disclosed at the time of their use. An exploit for one of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-36802, was also used in the wild as a zero-day and was sold on the dark web.""Very few knew about CVE-2023-36802 until Microsoft addressed it as part of its September 2023 Patch Tuesday updates. However, Cyfirma spotted an exploit for it being sold on the dark web as early as February of that year, seven months before the security advisories began popping up.The earliest signs of Raspberry Robin abusing CVE-2023-36802 came in October, just weeks after Patch Tuesday and the same month that public exploit code was made available.Researchers believe this points to the team's access to a developer given the time it took to start making use of the vulnerability, especially compared to a year earlier when it was using year-old vulns.It is possible the Raspberry Robin team stumbled upon the February exploit and bought that, or someone in-house may have quickly developed their own after spotting it in Microsoft's update list, but this is seen as the less likely option.Another case from earlier in 2023 also pointed to the possibility of Raspberry Robin's ties to sophisticated developers.""After looking at samples of Raspberry Robin prior to October, we found that it also used an exploit for CVE-2023-29360,"" said CPR. ""This vulnerability was publicly disclosed in June and was used by Raspberry Robin in August. Even though this is a pretty easy vulnerability to exploit, the fact that the exploit writer had a working sample before there was a known exploit in GitHub is impressive as is how quickly Raspberry Robin used it.- Psst â€¦ wanna jailbreak ChatGPT? Thousands of malicious prompts for sale- Why we update... Data-thief malware exploits SmartScreen on unpatched Windows PCs- A tale of 2 casino ransomware attacks: One paid out, one did not- Something nasty injected login-stealing JavaScript into 50K online banking sessions""This exploit also has the same loader and the same obfuscation scheme for the strings as the CVE-2023-36802 exploit and the flow is similar. Interestingly, this vulnerability is also in the mskssrv.sys, meaning the exploit writer is working on this driver. We may see other vulnerabilities in the driver being exploited in the wild.""Analysis of the malware showed that these exploits were being used as external 64-bit executables, which to the CPR researchers indicates that they were bought rather than developed in-house.""If the Raspberry Robin authors were the developers of the exploits, then they would have probably used the exploits in the main component itself,"" said CPR. ""In addition, the exploits would be packed in the same way and have the same format as the different stages of the main component.""The fact that these executables were 64-bit only hints towards outside development, since Raspberry Robin was developed for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.The abuses also didn't use the same high degree of obfuscation techniques as Raspberry Robin's main component does, such as control flow flattening and variable masking.Raspberry Robin plays an important role in the world of cybercrime and is trusted by many of the major criminal groups that are tracked by security researchers, such as EvilCorp, TA505, IcedID, and various ransomware affiliates.Last year it was named as one of the three malware loaders that were jointly responsible for 80 percent of cyberattacks between January and August 2023, alongside QBot and SocGholish.In publishing its suspicions about Raspberry Robin's shift toward buying exploits, CPR also found an array of new features had been added. The malware is well known for its regular updates, especially focused on anti-evasion techniques, and the latest version is no different.It comes loaded with new methods to prevent researchers from analyzing its inner workings as well as new routines for surviving system shutdowns. Minor updates to its communication and lateral movement logic have also made it through the pipeline. Â®",news and industry updates,marketing,FALSE

Why Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is Growing,"Cybersecurity In-Depth: Feature articles on security strategy, latest trends, and people to know.Why Demand for Tabletop Exercises Is GrowingTabletop exercises can be an effective and affordable way to test an organization's defense and response capabilities against cyberattack.February 8, 2024Organizations that are regularly defending against cyberattacks can find it useful to occasionally take a step back and test their defense and response capabilities. One way to do this is through cybersecurity drills, which provide organizations with a snapshot of their ability to handle ransomware, phishing, and other attacks.Cybersecurity drills come in many forms, including penetration testing, phishing simulations, and live-fire exercises, with some scenarios costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and running over several days or even weeks.The least complex of these drills are tabletop exercises, which typically run for two to four hours and can cost less than $50,000 (sometimes much less), with much of the expense related to planning and facilitating the event.Unlike some other drills, tabletop exercises often don't involve attacks on live IT systems. Instead, a facilitator lays out a cyberattack scenario and employees of the client organization discuss the steps they would take in response.This common approach to tabletop exercises is old-school and low-tech, but proponents say a well-run scenario can expose holes in organizations' response and mitigation plans.Tabletop Exercises Are in DemandDemand for tabletop exercises has grown exponentially in the past two years, driven by compliance issues, board directives, and cyber insurance mandates, says Mark Lance, vice president of incident response at GuidePoint Security, a cybersecurity consulting firm.In some cases, employees ask for tabletop exercises to help educate executives. ""People want their senior leadership teams to understand the true impacts of a potential incident,"" Lance says.Many cybersecurity organizations promote tabletop exercises as a way for organizations to test and improve their incident response and internal and external communication plans following a cyberattack. The nonprofit Center for Internet Security calls tabletops ""a must,"" stressing that they help organizations better coordinate separate business units in response to an attack and identify the employees who will play critical roles during and after an attack.There are no cut-and-paste ways to run a tabletop exercise, though the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency provides packages to help organizations get started. Some organizations run tabletops with internal teams, although the more common approach is to hire an outside cybersecurity vendor.How Tabletop Exercises WorkIn a typical tabletop, the facilitator leads a discussion by asking a series of questions. For example, a scenario can start with an employee calling into a help desk after seeing unusual activity on the company's network. Some questions in a tabletop for IT teams might be:What are your next steps?How are you performing that investigation?How are you correlating that activity to other activities in your environment?How is that tracked in an incident ticket?When does the activity reach a certain level of severity?When do you bring in your incident management team?A tabletop for executives might include the following questions:An incident has been reported â€” when are we bringing in external counsel?When are we using our cyber insurance policy?When should internal and external notifications go out?Who is drafting the notifications?Tabletops can start with hundreds of different scenarios, including widespread problems like ransomware and phishing attacks. However, individual tabletops need to focus specifically on the organization or its industry to be successful, Lance says, adding that the success or failure of a tabletop depends largely on the provider's ability to plan the exercise and target it to the specific client.""The more specific it is to their environment, the more inclined they are to stay engaged and interested, because there's a level of authenticity and validity to it,"" he says.GuidePoint, for example, taps its own threat intelligence team to come up with real-world scenarios that are realistic to the client and are recent or emerging threats.Another way to ensure success is by running separate tabletop exercises for an organization's senior leadership and technical teams. Lance says these two groups benefit from different scenarios. Executives often want to talk about companywide issues and high-level decisions that need to be made. In contrast, technical people want to get into the nitty-gritty of stopping and mitigating an attack.""If you do a technical tabletop, your technical resources might not open up the same way if you have senior leadership sitting in with them,"" Lance says. ""In the other direction, senior leadership may not want to seem nontechnical or stupid in front of their technical resources, so they might not open up as much. [With both groups involved], you have too loud of a voice in the room.""Learning Through Realistic ScenariosIn addition to failing to provide a realistic scenario, facilitators of tabletop exercises also can falter by failing to keep a group engaged or by being more of an observer than a leader, says Curtis Fechner, cyber practice leader and engineering fellow at cybersecurity consulting and integration provider Optiv. Participant engagement is the biggest factor in a tabletop's success, he adds.""If I'm very passive,"" Fechner says, ""if I'm not prompting questions or challenging their responses and just passively letting them talk, or if you get a group of people [complaining] among themselves about a problem, that kills the exercise, the momentum, and the energy.""However, if you've planned for a relevant scenario and kept the participants engaged, it's difficult for a tabletop exercise to fail, he says. A well-facilitated discussion will result in participants learning about their organization's incident response plans and identifying areas that could be improved.Most cybersecurity exercises contain a learning curve for everyone involved, says Peter Manev, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Stamus Networks, a network detection and response provider. In December, Stamus Networks participated in a live-fire exercise called Crossed Swords, organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence (CCDCOE).The best outcomes to tabletop exercises are when ""the teams are clicking together, learning together, exchanging information and experiences, and, of course, making progress,"" Manev says. ""In my view, if that happens, you've already accomplished something.""At the end of an exercise, Fechner likes to take a half hour to discuss the lessons learned throughout. He asks participants what they think they did well and where the pain points were.""That, to me, is a successful tabletop right there â€” when you get those people to actually do that sort of self-analysis and come out with that introspection,"" he says.

Stealthy Zardoor Backdoor Targets Saudi Islamic Charity Organization,"An unnamed Islamic non-profit organization in Saudi Arabia has been targeted as part of a stealthy cyber espionage campaign designed to drop a previously undocumented backdoor called Zardoor.Cisco Talos, which discovered the activity in May 2023, said the campaign has likely persisted since at least March 2021, adding it has identified only one compromised target to date, although it's suspected that there could be other victims.""Throughout the campaign, the adversary used living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins) to deploy backdoors, establish command-and-control (C2), and maintain persistence,"" security researchers Jungsoo An, Wayne Lee, and Vanja Svajcer said, calling out the threat actor's ability to maintain long-term access to victim environments without attracting attention.The intrusion targeting the Islamic charitable organization involved the periodic exfiltration of data roughly twice a month. The exact initial access vector used to infiltrate the entity is currently unknown.The foothold obtained, however, has been leveraged to drop Zardoor for persistence, followed by establishing C2 connections using open-source reverse proxy tools such as Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP), sSocks, and Venom.""Once a connection was established, the threat actor used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to move laterally and spread the attacker's tools â€” including Zardoor â€” by spawning processes on the target system and executing commands received from the C2,"" the researchers said.The as-yet-undetermined infection pathway paves the way for a dropper component that, in turn, deploys a malicious dynamic-link library (""oci.dll"") that's responsible for delivering two backdoor modules, ""zar32.dll"" and ""zor32.dll.""While the former is the core backdoor element that facilitates C2 communications, the latter ensures that ""zar32.dll"" has been deployed with administrator privileges. Zardoor is capable of exfiltrating data, executing remotely fetched executables and shellcode, updating the C2 IP address, and deleting itself from the host.The origins of the threat actor behind the campaign are unclear, and it does not share any tactical overlaps with a known, publicly reported threat actor at this time. That said, it's assessed to be the work of an ""advanced threat actor.""",data breaches and security incidents,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
China Caught Dropping RAT Designed for FortiGate Devices,"Dutch military intelligence warns that new malware, called ""Coathanger,"" was found in multiple FortiGate devices during an incident response, and that Chinese-state actors are using the persistent RAT for espionage.February 8, 2024The Netherlands' Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) is warning that it has uncovered a new malware strain, persistent and difficult to detect, being deployed by the Chinese government against an existing FortiGate flaw, and that it's part of a wider political espionage campaign.The new remote access Trojan (RAT), called ""Coathanger,"" was used to spy on the Dutch Ministry and Defense (MOD) in 2023, according to a new advisory. During the response to the intrusion, Dutch intelligence service officials discovered the malware was being delivered through a known FortiGate flaw (CVE-2022-42475).Fortinet's FortiGate devices provide network firewall protections.The report stresses that Coathanger doesn't take advantage of a new zero-day exploit and is deployed as second-stage malware. However, the advisory added, ""Coathanger could be used along with an any future FortiGate device vulnerability.""Dutch officials explained, ""The Coathanger malware is stealthy and persistent. It hides itself by hooking system calls that could reveal its presence. It survives reboots and firmware upgrades.""Edge Devices in Cyberattack CrosshairsThe Coathanger malware is part of a wider campaign being waged by Chinese state-sponsored threat actors against Internet-facing edge devices including firewalls, VPN servers, and email servers, according to Dutch authorities.""Chinese threat actors are known to perform wide and opportunistic scanning campaigns for both published (nday) as well as unpublished (0-day) software vulnerabilities on internet-facing (edge) devices,"" the advisory cautioned. ""They do so with a high operational tempo, sometimes abusing vulnerabilities on the day they are published.""Fortinet devices are a popular cyberattack target, so businesses should stay on top of patches: Just this week, Fortinet reported two max-severity bugs in its FortiSIEM solution required immediate patching.Recommendations from intelligence analysts in the Netherlands to keep Coathanger at bay also include performing a regular risk analysis on edge devices, limiting Internet access on edge devices, scheduled logging analysis, and replacing any hardware no longer supported.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
"'Coyote' Malware Begins Its Hunt, Preying on 61 Banking Apps","Brazil, the world's center for banking Trojan malware, has produced one of its most advanced tools yet. And as history shows, Coyote may soon expand its territory.February 8, 2024Researchers have discovered a novel banking Trojan they dubbed ""Coyote,"" which is hunting for credentials for 61 different online banking applications.""Coyote,"" detailed by Kaspersky in an analysis today, is notable both for its broad targeting of banking-sector apps (the majority, for now, in Brazil), and its sophisticated interweaving of different rudimentary and advanced components: a relatively new open source installer called Squirrel; NodeJs; an unsung programming language called ""Nim""; and more than a dozen malicious functionalities. In all, it represents a notable evolution in Brazil's thriving market for financial malware â€” and could spell big trouble down the line for security teams if it expands its focus.""They've been developing banking Trojans for more than 20 years â€” they started in the year 2000,"" Fabio Assolini, head of the Latin American Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky, says of Brazilian malware developers. ""In 24 years of developing and bypassing new authentication methods and new protection technologies, they've been very creative, and you can see it now with this very new Trojan.""It may be a Brazil-focused threat to consumers for now, but as mentioned, there are clear reasons for organizations to be aware of Coyote. For one, as Assolini warns, ""the malware families that had success in tackling the Brazil market in the past have also expanded abroad. That's why corporations and banks must be prepared to deal with it.""And another reason for security teams to pay attention to the emergence of new banking Trojans is their history of evolving into fully fledged initialaccess Trojans and backdoors; this was the case with Emotet and Trickbot, for instance, and more recently, QakBot and Ursinif.Coyote has functionality in the wings to follow suit: It can execute a range of commands, including directives to take screenshots, log keystrokes, kill processes, shut down the machine, and move its cursor. It can also outright freeze the machine with a fake ""Working on updates â€¦"" overlay.The Coyote Trojan Runs With Squirrel & NimSo far in its attacks, Coyote behaves like any other modern banking Trojan: When a compatible app is triggered on an infected machine, the malware pings an attacker-controlled command-and-control (C2) server displays an appropriate phishing overlay on the victim's screen in order to capture a user's login information. Coyote stands out most, though, for how it combats potential detections.Most banking Trojans utilize Windows Installers (MSI), Kaspersky noted in its blog post, making them an easy red flag for cybersecurity defenders. That's why Coyote opts for Squirrel, a legitimate open source tool for installing and updating Windows desktop apps. Using Squirrel, Coyote attempts to mask its malicious initial stage loader as a perfectly honest update packager.>Its final stage loader is even more unique, as it's written in a relatively niche programming language called ""Nim."" This is the very first banking Trojan Kaspersky has identified using Nim.""Most of the old banking Trojans were written in Delphi, which is quite old and utilized across a lot of families. So over the years, the detection of Delphi malware got very good, and the efficiency of infections was slowing down over the years,"" Assolini explains. With Nim, ""they have a more modern language to program with new features and a low rate of detection by security software.""Brazilian Banking Trojans Are a Global ProblemIf Coyote has to do so much to distinguish itself, it's because the world's fifth-largest nation has in recent years become the world's premier hub for banking malware.And for as much as they terrorize Brazilians, these programs also have a habit of crossing bodies of water.""These guys are very experienced in developing banking Trojans, and they're eager to expand their attacks worldwide,"" Assolini emphasizes. ""Right now, we can find Brazilian bank Trojans attacking companies and people as far away as Australia and Europe. This week, a member of my team found a new version of one in Italy.""To demonstrate the potential future for a tool like Coyote, Assolini points to Grandoreiro, a similar Trojan that made serious inroads into Mexico and Spain but also well beyond. By the end of last fall, he says, it had reached a total of 41 countries.A byproduct of that success, however, was increased scrutiny from law enforcement. In a step toward disrupting its free-flowing cyber underground for this kind of malware, Brazilian police made a rare move: They executed five temporary arrest warrants and 13 search and seizure warrants, for the architects behind Grandoreiro across five Brazilian states.""The problem in Brazil is they don't have very good local law enforcement for punishing these attackers. It works better when you have an entity outside of the country applying some pressure, as happened with Granadoreiro, when the police and banks in Spain were pressuring Brazilian federal police to catch these guys,"" Assolini says.So, he concludes, ""they're getting better, but there's a long way to go, because a lot of cybercriminals are still free [in Brazil] and committing lots of attacks worldwide.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
New Webinar: 5 Steps to vCISO Success for MSPs and MSSPs,"2024 will be the year of the vCISO. An incredible 45% of MSPs and MSSPs are planning to start offering vCISO services in 2024. As an MSP/MSSP providing vCISO services, you own the organization's cybersecurity infrastructure and strategy. But you also need to position yourself as a reliable decision-maker, navigating professional responsibilities, business needs and leadership requirements. A new webinar by Cynomi, vCISO platform leader, hosting CISO and vCISO veteran Jesse Miller from PowerPSA Consulting, provides MSPs and MSSPs with an effective 100-day plan to build themselves up for success.The webinar provides a tangible five-step 100-day action plan that any MSP/MSSP can follow when they engage with a new vCISO client. It also provides guidance on vCISO goals and pitfalls to avoid. By watching the webinar, you can position yourself as a strategic and long-term partner for your clients. They will see you as capable of driving security transformation and managing security continuously and dynamically.Some of the main highlights covered in the webinar:vCISO GoalsWhen starting as a vCISO, it's important to understand the vCISO's goals and use them to guide you throughout your role:- Establishing, overseeing and managing organizational security in a flexible and robust manner.- Fostering trust with security goals through alignment, to get leadership and stakeholder buy-in.- Making security a business enabler, contributing to compliance, operational efficiency, a competitive advantage, financial responsibility, and more.Pitfalls to AvoidAt the same time, stay clear of pitfalls that can disrupt your ability to provide high-quality services. Some tips for avoiding pitfalls include:- Stay strategic and resist the temptation to put out fires.- Maintain objectivity and avoid getting caught up in organizational politics.- Use automation, not manual processes. Those are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient compared.- Ensure compliance to avoid grave legal and reputational consequences.- Delegate and build the infrastructure rather than doing everything yourself.- And moreThe 5 Phases: Your 100 Day Action PlanPhase 1: Research (Days 0-30)Welcome to your new client! Start by researching the current state of the organization's security posture and business objectives. This involves building relationships with stakeholders and the IT/security team, reviewing management practices, policies and configurations, and assessing vendor management processes and third-party risks. These actions will help you understand the potential vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of existing security controls and procedures.Phase 2 Understand (Days 0-45)Now, it's time to bring your findings together. This starts with conducting a security risk assessment with a standard onboarding questionnaire and scanning tool. Then, use all the information from the assessment and from phase one to create a clear picture of security maturity and the security posture. After presenting this posture and existing gaps to management, you will be able to develop a list of short-term and long-term needs based on risks and business objectives. In the list, make sure to demonstrate the business value of your security investments. When possible, use automation for efficiency.Phase 3: Prioritize (Days 15-60)The third step is about shaping actionable plans.Draft short, mid and long-term goals and develop the plan and required budget to achieve these goals. Identify 2-3 quick wins that will improve security and your organizational stance and share all these deliverables, together with a risk register, with management.Phase 4: Execute (Days 30-80)Now is the time to execute. This will establish your vCISO credibility and set the tone for ongoing security management. Once you have stakeholder and management buy-in, communicate your plan across the board, creating a sense of shared responsibility and success. Start executing the tasks that will help you achieve your goals: implementing automated systems, the quick wins you identified, high-priority policy creation, and new tools and products. As soon as possible, set up the reporting cadence to help you demonstrate improvement. And as always, in a fast-moving environment, be prepared to adjust as needed.Phase 5 - Report (Days 45-100)Reporting is key for demonstrating success. Collect data that reflects progress and success, like reduced incident response times or fewer successful phishing attempts. Make sure to communicate this data to management in a way that shows the business impact, successes and challenges, and security progress. On top of this frequent reporting, conduct an additional full assessment after 3-4 months to demonstrate progress and identify any new or unresolved vulnerabilities. Based on these reports, continuously adapt and improve your processes and controls to keep security measures effective and relevant.Your Next Steps as a vCISOMaking meaningful choices, measuring your impact, and maintaining a flexible mindset will set you up for success on your vCISO journey. To get more insights, understand how this plan comes together and to get a complete list of tasks and a checklist to guide you throughout your first 100 days, watch the webinar here.",news and industry updates,vulnerability reports,FALSE

IoT/OT Network Adversaries Advance Amidst Bug Barrage,"February 8, 2024New telemetry data from Internet of Things and operational technology networks brings into sharp focus the risks associated with IoT and OT installations: These networks are subject to highly sophisticated attacks, while in tandem, the volume of vulnerabilities associated with each explodes. And consequently, IoT and OT networks pose even greater risks than generally acknowledged.Data from the last half of 2023 analyzed by Nozomi Networks showed the largest portion of threats to IoT and OT networks were network anomalies and attacks, with sophisticated tactics like TCP flood and network scans being most popular, the company said in a new report.""These trends should serve as a warning that attackers are adopting more sophisticated methods to directly target critical infrastructure, and could be indicative of rising global hostilities,"" Chris Grove, director of cybersecurity strategy at Nozomi Networks, said in a statement about the new data. ""The significant uptick in anomalies could mean that the threat actors are getting past the first line of defense while penetrating deeper than many would have initially believed, which would require a high level of sophistication.""Meanwhile, tried-and-true IoT and OT cyberattack approaches like access control and authorization threats, including brute force and multiple login attacks, were up too â€” by 123%.A bit of good news: There was a 12% dip in daily cyberattacks against IoT devices during the last half of 2023.Vulnerabilities Add to IoT/OT ThreatPiling additional cyber-risk onto IoT and OT network defenders was the mounting number of vulnerabilities affecting industrial control systems (ICS) identified by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which rose 38% over the previous six months, the Nozomi Networks analysis added. Manufacturing vulnerabilities dominated the CISA list, with a 230% increase in discoveries over the previous half-year.Similarly, the number of vendors impacted by CISA-reported ICS bugs was up by 19%.Grove tells Dark Reading that it's unrealistic to think any network can be 100% secure.""That's why it's important to focus not only on security defenses but also adopt a post-breach mentality,"" Grove adds. ""To minimize risk and maximize operational resiliency, prioritize strategies that include network segmentation, asset discovery, vulnerability management, patching, logging, endpoint detection, and threat intelligence.""Actionable asset and threat intelligence should also be part of the cyber defense mix, Grove says.""In an increasingly complex threat landscape, resiliency will be the key to effective defenses,"" he adds.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Google Starts Blocking Sideloading of Potentially Dangerous Android Apps in Singapore,"Google has unveiled a new pilot program in Singapore that aims to prevent users from sideloading certain apps that abuse Android app permissions to read one-time passwords and gather sensitive data.""This enhanced fraud protection will analyze and automatically block the installation of apps that may use sensitive runtime permissions frequently abused for financial fraud when the user attempts to install the app from an Internet-sideloading source (web browsers, messaging apps or file managers),"" the company said.The feature is designed to examine the permissions declared by a third-party app in real-time and look for those that seek to gain access to sensitive permissions associated with reading SMS messages, deciphering or dismissing notifications from legitimate apps, and accessibility services that have been routinely abused by Android-based malware for extracting valuable information.As part of the test, users in Singapore who attempt to sideload such apps (or APK files) will be blocked from doing so via Google Play Protect and displayed a pop-up message that reads: ""This app can request access to sensitive data. This can increase the risk of identity theft or financial fraud.""""These permissions are frequently abused by fraudsters to intercept one-time passwords via SMS or notifications, as well as spy on-screen content,"" Eugene Liderman, director of the mobile security strategy at Google, said.The change is part of a collaborative effort to combat mobile fraud, the tech giant said, urging app developers to follow best practices and review their apps' device permissions to ensure it does not violate the Mobile Unwanted Software principles.Google, which launched Google Play Protect real-time scanning at the code level to detect novel Android malware in select markets like India, Thailand, Singapore, and Brazil, said the effort allowed it to detect 515,000 new malicious apps and that it issued no less than 3.1 million warnings or blocks of those apps.The development also comes as Apple announced sweeping changes to the App Store in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) ahead of the March 6, 2024, deadline. The changes, including Notarization for iOS apps, are expected to go live with iOS 17.4.The iPhone maker, however, repeatedly emphasized that distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces exposes E.U. users to ""increased privacy and security threats,"" and that it does not intend to bring them to other regions.""This includes new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats,"" Apple said.

Chinese Hackers Operate Undetected in U.S. Critical Infrastructure for Half a Decade,"The U.S. government on Wednesday said the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as Volt Typhoon had been embedded into some critical infrastructure networks in the country for at least five years.Targets of the threat actor include communications, energy, transportation, and water and wastewater systems sectors in the U.S. and Guam.""Volt Typhoon's choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions,"" the U.S. government said.The idea is to pre-position themselves on IT networks by maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time for disruptive or destructive cyber attacks against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the country.The joint advisory, which was released by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was also backed by other nations that are part of the Five Eyes (FVEY) intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K.Volt Typhoon â€“ which is also called Bronze Silhouette, Insidious Taurus, UNC3236, Vanguard Panda, or Voltzite â€“ is a stealthy China-based cyber espionage group that's believed to be active since June 2021.It first came to light in May 2023 when FVEY and Microsoft revealed that the hacking crew managed to establish a persistent foothold into critical infrastructure organizations in the U.S. and Guam for extended periods of time sans getting detected by principally leveraging living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques.""This kind of tradecraft, known as 'living off the land,' allows attackers to operate discreetly, with malicious activity blending in with legitimate system and network behavior making it difficult to differentiate â€“ even by organizations with more mature security postures,"" the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said.Another hallmark tactic adopted by Volt Typhoon is the use of multi-hop proxies like KV-botnet to route malicious traffic through a network of compromised routers and firewalls in the U.S. to mask its true origins.Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, in a report published in June 2023, called out its reliance on an extensive arsenal of open-source tooling against a narrow set of victims to achieve its strategic goals.""Volt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre-exploitation reconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment; tailor their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the victim's environment; and dedicate ongoing resources to maintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time, even after initial compromise,"" the agencies noted.""The group also relies on valid accounts and leverages strong operational security, which combined, allows for long-term undiscovered persistence.""Furthermore, the nation-state has been observed attempting to obtain administrator credentials within the network by exploiting privilege escalation flaws, subsequently leveraging the elevated access to facilitate lateral movement, reconnaissance, and full domain compromise.The ultimate goal of the campaign is to retain access to the compromised environments, ""methodically"" re-targeting them over years to validate and expand their unauthorized accesses. This meticulous approach, per the agencies, is evidenced in cases where they have repeatedly exfiltrated domain credentials to ensure access to current and valid accounts.""In addition to leveraging stolen account credentials, the actors use LOTL techniques and avoid leaving malware artifacts on systems that would cause alerts,"" CISA, FBI, and NSA said.""Their strong focus on stealth and operational security allows them to maintain long-term, undiscovered persistence. Further, Volt Typhoon's operational security is enhanced by targeted log deletion to conceal their actions within the compromised environment.""The development comes as the Citizen Lab revealed a network of at least 123 websites impersonating local news outlets spanning 30 countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America that's pushing pro-China content in a widespread influence campaign linked to a Beijing public relations firm named Shenzhen Haimaiyunxiang Media Co., Ltd.The Toronto-based digital watchdog, which dubbed the influence operation PAPERWALL, said it shares similarities with HaiEnergy, albeit with different operators and unique TTPs.""A central feature of PAPERWALL, observed across the network of websites, is the ephemeral nature of its most aggressive components, whereby articles attacking Beijing's critics are routinely removed from these websites some time after they are published,"" the Citizen Lab said.In a statement shared with Reuters, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington said ""it is a typical bias and double standard to allege that the pro-China contents and reports are 'disinformation,' and to call the anti-China ones 'true information.'""",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Super Bowl LVIII Presents a Vast Attack Surface for Threat Actors,"February 8, 2024The outcome of this year's Super Bowl matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers on Feb. 11 at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas will likely remain unknown until the last down of the game. But one thing that is already abundantly clear is that attackers will have no shortage of targets to blitz at the event.The NFL's continuing digitization of almost all aspects of the event, from ticketing to gate access systems and virtually every other point of contact with fans, has opened new vulnerabilities and targets that its security team has had to secure. Concerns include threats to arena security, ransomware attacks on critical systems, phishing and credential theft, and threats to personal data and other sensitive information belonging to fans, NFL employees, players, and coaches.Preparing for the Big (Security) GameIn a conversation with Dark Reading at the beginning of the 2023/2024 season, NFL CISO TomÃ¡s Maldonado had identified AI-enabled phishing attacks and deepfake audio and video scams as adding to the slew of other existing security challenges the league has had to contend with in general.The NFL itself has been preparing for some time to identify and assess threats to the Super Bowlâ€”easily the most watched TV event each yearâ€”and to implement plans for dealing with them. Last September, league officials in coordination with 100 other stakeholders, including the US Department of Homeland Security and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), conducted a tabletop exercise where they ran through a series of attack scenarios that together had a cascading impact on physical systems supporting the event.That exercise was part of an ongoing effort between the NFL and the other participants to prepare for whatever security challenge might surface at the game. Stakeholders added that the preparation will be especially key considering the heightened geopolitical tensions around events in the Middle East.The Security Implications of Sporting Event DigitizationKarl Mattson, field CISO at Noname Security, views API-related security issues as likely a big focus for attackers this year, given the NFL's extensive digital transformation in recent years.""API threats surrounding the Super Bowl come in three areas: the fan digital experience, advertising, and event infrastructure,"" Mattson says.The most likely scenario, if an API-related attack were to happen, is a large-scale compromise of NFL fan personal information stolen, which may include authentication or biometric information, he notes. The digital fan experience of purchasing tickets, merchandise shopping, online betting, and other interactions all utilize services enabled by APIs. ""Each aspect of a fan consuming the NFL's product involves the exchange of personal or payment information which can be exploited by an attacker who discovers a poorly controlled API,"" he says.The same is true for advertisers who air commercials during the event, and set up a new website or service to field consumer response. Without first battle-testing them for a flood of visitors or DDoS efforts, the effort can fumble. Mattson points to the memorable 2022 Super Bowl ad by Coinbase that included only a bouncing QR code, which pointed viewers to a promotion website the company had set up for the ad. The website ended up crashing shortly after the ad aired because of the sheer volume of visitors.Physical event-specific and public infrastructure to support the Super Bowl are also enabled by API-first technologies. The stadium's 5G network, local security and emergency services, and public utility systems all use API-based services for routine operations that attackers could potentially seek to disrupt, Mattson says.Online Gambling: A Breeding Ground for New ScamsThe rise of online gambling and sports betting opens up a new gridiron for cyberattackers. The phenomenon has created a breeding ground for new and evolving scams targeting events like the Super Bowl, says Stuart Wells, CTO at Jumio.""A plethora of betting apps and websites are readily available at our fingertips, attracting a wider audience, including younger demographics more accustomed to digital interactions,"" Wells says. This accessibility, unfortunately, coincides with a rise in synthetic identity fraud, where criminals create fake identities using a false name and bits and pieces of stolen identity information â€” such as a real birth date and Social Security numbers.""Synthetic identity fraud, in particular, can be tricky for gaming operators as it makes malicious actors extremely difficult to trace,"" Wells notes. ""If an attacker can bypass defenses and operate under a synthetic identity, they may be able to operate undetected, meaning that operators might not catch a fraudster until a player's account has been manipulated or some kind of fraud has been committed.""Exacerbating the situation is the relative lack of privacy protections in many of the betting apps that people use to make wagers during events like the Super Bowl. A new study by data privacy company Incogni examined seven of the most popular betting apps; most of them are collecting and sharing private data extensively without proper disclosure.The biggest data hog was DraftKings, which Incogni found was gathering 22 data points from users, including their precise location, contacts, messages, photos, and videos. Betting apps from Caesars, Sky Bet, and William Hill were relatively close behind, gathering 17 data points each, including precise location, in-app search history, health information, and purchase histories. Meanwhile, Caesars led the rest when it came to sharing the data it collects from user devices with third parties.Super Bowl fans should also expect a surge of fake tickets and counterfeit merchandise in online marketplaces, tempting fans with jerseys, hats, and memorabilia that look real but are cheaply made and lack official logos, Well says.""All of these scams are likely to make their way to consumers via phishing emails and texts. Consumers should proceed with caution and verify who they are doing business with before handing over any personal information or payment,"" he warns.Business Risk From Unauthorized Streaming SitesKen Carnesi, CEO of DNSFilter, points to unauthorized streaming sites as a risk for organizations that let employees use unmanaged devices for work-related purposes. Data that the company gathered from its network over the last month showed a sharp increase in blocked sites with ""NFL"" in the domain name, he says.""Traffic increased on our network during the playoffs, peaking on Jan. 28, the same day as the AFC and NFC championship game,"" Carnesi says. ""Overall, from Jan. 5 to the peak on Jan. 28, it was a 125% increase in security-blocked traffic.""Risks to organizations that permit work-related devices for personal use without any controls include a heightened likelihood of malware infections and phishing attacks.""Additionally, these streaming activities can create network vulnerabilities, with insecure channels and peer-to-peer connections posing risks to the organization's data integrity,"" Carnesi says. ""Data exfiltration is also an increased possibility, potentially exposing sensitive company information from illicit sites collecting and misusing user data.""About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
India to make its digital currency programmable,"Reserve Bank also wants a national 2FA frameworkThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced on Thursday it would make its digital currency programmable, and ensure it can be exchanged when citizens are offline.The country's current CBDC retail pilot launched in late 2022. It already enables both person-to-person and person-to-merchant transactions. Apparently, that's going well enough for RBI to add more functions.""It is now proposed to enable additional functionalities of programmability and offline capability in CBDC retail payments,"" stated RBI in its latest monthly governor's statement. ""Programmability will facilitate transactions for specific/targeted purposes, while offline functionality will enable these transactions in areas with poor or limited internet connectivity.""India has plenty of those â€“ both in remote locations and in its mountainous regions where it's hard to create pervasive mobile networks.The new functions are to be introduced gradually through more pilot programs.Indian media report that governor Shaktikanta Das outlined scenarios for the programmable digital rupee, including allowing government agencies to ensure payments to citizens are only used for defined benefits. Businesses, he added, could ""program specified expenditures like business travel for their employees."" Das even envisaged digital cash being tied to geographical areas.- Programmable or 'purpose-bound' money is coming, probably as a feature in central bank digital currencies- Florida man slams 'tyranny' of central bank digital currencies in re-election bid- Use AI to accelerate adoption of central bank digital currencies, says IMF head- Britcoin or Britcon? Bank of England grilled on Digital Pound privacy concernsRBI's e-rupee plans extend beyond making programmable and offline CBDCs. It plans to put in place a principle-based framework for authentication of digital payment transactions. It has already tested additional factor authentication â€“ including SMS-based OTP â€“ but would like some more options.In the governor's message, RBI chief general manager Yogesh Dayal framed these initiatives as an economic development accelerator.""At the current juncture, India's potential growth is propelled by structural drivers like improving physical infrastructure; development of world class digital and payments technology; ease of doing business; enhanced labour force participation; and improved quality of fiscal spending,"" asserted Dayal.Another way India is looking to build its digital economy is by allowing itself to tax more of it. Bloomberg reported the nation will call for the end of a 1998 agreement not to tax digital goods.

How Hospitals Can Help Improve Medical Device Data Security,"February 8, 2024COMMENTARYHospitals and medical device manufacturers must team up to help create a secure environment to protect the personal health information derived from patient monitors and other medical devices.For some time, this notion of shared responsibility for data security has been recognized as a best practice within the larger technology industry. For example, many cloud service providers follow this model to define the mutual security obligations of the cloud providers and their customers.Within healthcare, a similar model has emerged, with medical researchers, developers, and regulatory bodies agreeing that cybersecurity is, in fact, a shared responsibility. This means medical device manufacturers, hospital software providers, and health organizations must collaborate to shield patient information and medical device systems against cybercriminal activity.Understanding Roles in Medical Device Data SecurityThe US FDA requires medical device manufacturers and software providers to follow a process called security by design, which maintains that certain controls must be embedded in a product to make it easier for hospitals to deploy and use them securely.Features such as configurable encryption, secure login pages, and user authentication requirements are examples of how manufacturers integrate security capabilities into their products. These security features in the product's design often require hospitals to take action to activate them and maintain their viability.Consider the example of product access control. Typically, a device manufacturer or software provider can implement access controls in product functionalities by verifying or authenticating the identity of a clinical user. Looking at a hospital's Active Directory service and utilizing necessary passwords and protocols can determine if the user belongs to a group the product recognizes through its configuration.Only the healthcare organization can identify which users are authorized to access the system and configure the product appropriately. Using an inappropriate group, allowing too many users, or being lax about maintaining an up-to-date directory can open a network to unnecessary risk.Even mobile and cloud-based applications require shared responsibility. Hospitals must ensure that browsers and mobile devices are up to date with security features enabled to optimize the manufacturer's cloud-based security controls, such as multifactor authentication.Therefore, to facilitate secure product implementation, medical equipment manufacturers must embed security controls using proven algorithms and designs guided by the security-by-design process. At the same time, hospitals have their own share of responsibilities and activities to ensure the product is used securely.With different products available throughout their facilities, it can be difficult for IT leaders to know how to proceed. For security measures to be successful, hospitals and manufacturers must collaborate to determine what will best meet the hospital's needs. Every hospital has processes and procedures to secure its IT infrastructure, which extend to all products within a system.Before a hospital deploys a device, its manufacturer must be transparent about the security features that the hospital can use, as well as their expectations of the hospital environment. Hospitals, in turn, should educate themselves about those security features and determine if they meet their expectations.How Do Hospitals Know Their Role?Manufacturers usually make it easy for hospitals to understand how to optimize medical data security. They often provide clinical users and system administrators with information and guidelines such as the Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2), software bills of materials (SBOMs), hardening guides, and other security guidance materials.These documents provide step-by-step blueprints for healthcare providers to follow to do their part to protect medical device data from intrusion. Recommended steps may include restricting login access to specific personnel, securing connections between systems using network segmentation and restricted ports, using trusted certificates to verify the identity of medical devices and clinical data receiving systems, and other actions specific to the hospital's network.Read Manufacturers' Recommended Security GuidelinesManufacturers' product documentation and guides tell hospitals how to leverage a medical device or software's embedded security features for optimal use. It's important to review these guides every time a new version of a product or software is deployed because enhanced security controls may require additional measures, such as updated encryption configurations or new private keys.It's also not uncommon for some security controls, such as systems access needs or password requirements, to degrade over time as clinical users make configuration or access changes. Use these guides regularly to control the effectiveness of the current security configuration.Cybercriminals only need one weak spot to infiltrate a network for nefarious purposes. To thwart their activity, manufacturers and hospitals need to team up and be clear about each other's roles and shared responsibilities in an end-to-end secure data environment.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Global Coalition and Tech Giants Unite Against Commercial Spyware Abuse,"A coalition of dozens of countries, including France, the U.K., and the U.S., along with tech companies such as Google, MDSec, Meta, and Microsoft, have signed a joint agreement to curb the abuse of commercial spyware to commit human rights abuses.The initiative, dubbed the Pall Mall Process, aims to tackle the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber intrusion tools by establishing guiding principles and policy options for States, industry, and civil society in relation to the development, facilitation, purchase, and use of such tools.The declaration stated that ""uncontrolled dissemination"" of spyware offerings contributes to ""unintentional escalation in cyberspace,"" noting it poses risks to cyber stability, human rights, national security, and digital security.""Where these tools are used maliciously, attacks can access victims' devices, listen to calls, obtain photos and remotely operate a camera and microphone via 'zero-click' spyware, meaning no user interaction is needed,"" the U.K. government said in a press release.According to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), thousands of individuals are estimated to have been globally targeted by spyware campaigns every year.""And as the commercial market for these tools grows, so too will the number and severity of cyber attacks compromising our devices and our digital systems, causing increasingly expensive damage and making it more challenging than ever for our cyber defenses to protect public institutions and services,"" Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said at the U.K.-France Cyber Proliferation conference.Notably missing from the list of countries that participated in the event is Israel, which is home to a number of private sector offensive actors (PSOAs) or commercial surveillance vendors (CSVs) such as Candiru, Intellexa (Cytrox), NSO Group, and QuaDream.Recorded Future News reported that Hungary, Mexico, Spain, and Thailand â€“ which have been linked to spyware abuses in the past â€“ did not sign the pledge.The multi-stakeholder action coincides with an announcement by the U.S. Department of State to deny visas for individuals that it deems to be involved with the misuse of dangerous spyware technology.""Until recently, a lack of accountability has enabled the spyware industry to proliferate dangerous surveillance tools around the world,"" Google said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. ""Limiting spyware vendors' ability to operate in the U.S. helps to change the incentive structure which has allowed their continued growth.""One hand, spyware such as Chrysaor and Pegasus are licensed to government customers for use in law enforcement and counterterrorism. On the other hand, they have also been routinely abused by oppressive regimes to target journalists, activists, lawyers, human rights defenders, dissidents, political opponents, and other civil society members.Such intrusions typically leverage zero-click (or one-click) exploits to surreptitiously deliver the surveillanceware onto the targets' Google Android and Apple iOS devices with the goal of harvesting sensitive information.That having said, ongoing efforts to combat and contain the spyware ecosystem have been something of a whack-a-mole, underscoring the challenge of fending off recurring and lesser-known players who provide or come up with similar cyber weapons.This also extends to the fact that CSVs continue to expend effort developing new exploit chains as companies like Apple, Google, and others discover and plug the zero-day vulnerabilities.|Source: Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG)""As long as there is a demand for surveillance capabilities, there will be incentives for CSVs to continue developing and selling tools, perpetrating an industry that harms high risk users and society at large,"" Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said.An extensive report published by TAG this week revealed that the company is tracking roughly 40 commercial spyware companies that sell their products to government agencies, with 11 of them linked to the exploitation of 74 zero-days in Google Chrome (24), Android (20), iOS (16), Windows (6), Adobe (2), and Mozilla Firefox (1) over the past decade.Unknown state-sponsored actors, for example, exploited three flaws in iOS (CVE-2023-28205, CVE-2023-28206, and CVE-2023-32409) as a zero-day last year to infect victims with spyware developed by Barcelona-based Variston.

HijackLoader Evolves: Researchers Decode the Latest Evasion Methods,"The threat actors behind a loader malware called HijackLoader have added new techniques for defense evasion, as the malware continues to be increasingly used by other threat actors to deliver additional payloads and tooling.""The malware developer used a standard process hollowing technique coupled with an additional trigger that was activated by the parent process writing to a pipe,"" CrowdStrike researchers Donato Onofri and Emanuele Calvelli said in a Wednesday analysis. ""This new approach has the potential to make defense evasion stealthier.""HijackLoader was first documented by Zscaler ThreatLabz in September 2023 as having been used as a conduit to deliver DanaBot, SystemBC, and RedLine Stealer. It's also known to share a high degree of similarity with another loader known as IDAT Loader.Both the loaders are assessed to be operated by the same cybercrime group. In the intervening months, HijackLoader has been propagated via ClearFake and put to use by TA544 (aka Narwhal Spider, Gold Essex, and Ursnif Gang) to deliver Remcos RAT and SystemBC via phishing messages.""Think of loaders like wolves in sheep's clothing. Their purpose is to sneak in, introduce and execute more sophisticated threats and tools,"" Liviu Arsene, director of threat research and reporting at CrowdStrike, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.""This recent variant of HijackLoader (aka IDAT Loader) steps up its sneaking game by adding and experimenting with new techniques. This is similar to enhancing its disguise, making it stealthier, more complex, and more difficult to analyze. In essence, they're refining their digital camouflage.""The starting point of the multi-stage attack chain is an executable (""streaming_client.exe"") that checks for an active internet connection and proceeds to download a second-stage configuration from a remote server.The executable then loads a legitimate dynamic-link library (DLL) specified in the configuration to activate shellcode responsible for launching the HijackLoader payload via a combination of process doppelgÃ¤nging and process hollowing techniques that increases the complexity of analysis and the defense evasion capabilities.""The HijackLoader second-stage, position-independent shellcode then performs some evasion activities to bypass user mode hooks using Heaven's Gate and injects subsequent shellcode into cmd.exe,"" the researchers said.""The injection of the third-stage shellcode is accomplished via a variation of process hollowing that results in an injected hollowed mshtml.dll into the newly spawned cmd.exe child process.""Heaven's Gate refers to a stealthy trick that allows malicious software to evade endpoint security products by invoking 64-bit code in 32-bit processes in Windows, effectively bypassing user-mode hooks.One of the key evasion techniques observed in HijackLoader attack sequences is the use of a process injection mechanism called transacted hollowing, which has been previously observed in malware such as the Osiris banking trojan.""Loaders are meant to act as stealth launch platforms for adversaries to introduce and execute more sophisticated malware and tools without burning their assets in the initial stages,"" Arsene said.""Investing in new defense evasion capabilities for HijackLoader (aka IDAT Loader) is potentially an attempt to make it stealthier and fly below the radar of traditional security solutions. The new techniques signal both a deliberate and experimental evolution of the existing defense evasion capabilities while also increasing the complexity of analysis for threat researchers.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
No one's happy with latest US cyber incident reporting plan,"IT suppliers hacked off with Uncle Sam's demands in aftermath of cyberattacksPlan says to hand over keys to networks â€“ and report intrusions within eight hours of discoveryOrganizations that sell IT services to Uncle Sam are peeved at proposed changes to procurement rules that would require them to allow US government agencies full access to their systems in the event of a security incident.The rules were unveiled in a draft update to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that refreshes security reporting standards for government contractors in line with President Biden's 2021 executive order on the topic.Among the potential incoming requirements are:- Contractors would have just eight hours to report a detected incident to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which would have to be updated every 72 hours thereafter;- A software bill of materials (SBOM) would need to be maintained;- After an incident, contractors would provide ""full access"" to IT systems and personnel for CISA and federal law enforcement agencies.The above ideas â€“ developed by Department of Defense (DoD), General Services Administration (GSA), and NASA â€“ have been suggested in light of the many infosec threats facing the USA.""SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange, and the Colonial Pipeline incident are a sobering reminder that US public and private sector entities increasingly face sophisticated malicious cyber activity from both nation-state actors and cyber criminals,"" the update from the three agencies reads.India's absurd infosec reporting rules get just 15 followersREAD MORE""These incidents share commonalities, including insufficient cyber security defenses that leave public and private sector entities more vulnerable to incidents,"" the trio added.

With more than 80 responses, it's clear many stakeholders wanted to have their say â€“ and all the aforementioned provisions were questioned.The Cloud Service Providers Advisory Board, (CSP-AB), which counts multiple major US cloud service firms among its members, described the new rules as ""burdensome â€¦ on information technology companies who are already meeting a high security and compliance bar across the federal marketplace.""The CSP-AB took particular umbrage with the FAR update's SBOM requirements, arguing cloud service providers shouldn't be required to submit them since they're so frequently subject to change â€“ sometimes ""up to hundreds of times"" per day.- Future of America's Cyber Safety Review Board hangs in balance amid calls for rethink- Ransomware more efficient than ever, and baddies are still after your logs- India's absurd infosec reporting rules get just 15 followers- Europe moves closer to stricter cybersecurity standards, reporting regsThe Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC), which represents a laundry list of heavy hitters, expressed dissatisfaction over the proposed reporting rules, describing them as adding ""another hue of color to the kaleidoscope of incident reporting regimes"" being passed by the US federal government of late.ITIC said the eight-hour reporting requirement was ""unduly burdensome and inconsistent"" with other reporting rules, adding that the 72-hour update period ""does not reflect the shifting urgency throughout an incident response.""Even bug bounty biz HackerOne weighed in, arguing among other things that the provision requiring access to contractor systems by federal law enforcement in the wake of a security incident ""has the potential to expose data and information from the contractor's non-federal customers.""""Non-federal customers may be reluctant to continue working with federal contractors, potentially forcing federal contractors to choose between selling to non-federal customers or the government,"" HackerOne warned.Reporting rules are myriad and inconsistentThere's room to debate some of the complaints raised by commenters, but one thing's for certain: Uncle Sam's cyber incident reporting rules are growing in number â€“ and each set of regulations is different.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implemented a rule last summer requiring victims to report cyberattacks to it within four days when the incident could have a ""material"" impact on the business or investors.

Due next month, CIRCIA will give companies in critical infrastructure sectors three days to report an incident.Congressional representatives have expressed discontent with the SEC's reporting rules and introduced a bill to kill its reporting requirement â€“ citing too short a deadline and the fact that incident reporting should fall under CISA's purview.

"Rust can help make software secure, but it's not a cure-all","Rust can help make software secure â€“ but it's no cure-allSecurity is a process, not a product. Nor a languageMemory-safety flaws represent the majority of high-severity problems for Google and Microsoft, but they're not necessarily associated with the majority of vulnerabilities that actually get exploited.So while coding with Rust can help reduce memory safety vulnerabilities, it won't fix everything.Security biz Horizon3.ai has analyzed CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities in 2023 and found, as chief attack engineer Zach Hanley put it, that ""Rust wonâ€™t save us, but it will help us.""We feel this is something that can't be said enough right now; if it's already obvious to you, well done. Rust will stop you using data after it's been freed, or try its best to stop you, but it can't really prevent you introducing logic bugs or passing unfiltered user input to a command interpreter.The most common vulnerabilities in 2023 had to do with insecure exposed functions, representing 48.8 percent of last year's crop. These include flaws like CVE-2023-33246 in Apache RocketMQ, in which the application ""insecurely exposed an endpoint that calls Java'sgetRuntime().exec() with an attacker-controlled variable.""Or CVE-2023-22515 in Atlassian Confluence, in which the application insecurely exposed an endpoint that allowed a server's configuration state to be modified.Memory safety flaws tied for second place alongside web routing and path abuse â€“ categories each representing 19.5 percent of 2023 vulnerabilities.CVE-2023-34362, the Progress MOVEit Transfer vulnerability, is an example of path abuse. In this instance, the application tried to limit access locally but contained a header parsing but that exposed functions.- Simon Willison interview: AI software still needs the human touch- Thousands of Juniper Networks devices vulnerable to critical RCE bug- Memory-safe languages so hot right now, agrees Lazarus Group as it slings DLang malware- Dump C++ and in Rust you should trust, Five Eyes agencies urgeWhile memory safety vulnerabilities may not have been the largest source of problems last year, they tend to have a significant impact because they're often identified at the time they're first actively exploited, before patches have been prepared.Horizon3.ai found that 75 percent of the memory safety bugs analyzed were exploited as zero-day flaws and that 25 percent of them were initially believed to have been spotted by security researchers who later discovered that others had already been exploiting them.""When vulnerabilities are exploited as zero-days they typically have a much more widespread effect on the world given that patches often lag by weeks once they are discovered,"" wrote Hanley.Hanley says that most of the vulnerabilities that are being exploited are simple to abuse. So while coding in Rust will help, more attention needs to be paid to the risks complex software presents.That work is already underway, through initiatives to harden the software supply chain and related projects.Amid the rush to Rust â€“ which has Microsoft recruiting developers to rewrite C# code in Rust and Google donating to improve Rust tooling â€“ it's easy to forget that security is a process, rather than a product.

Hyundai Motor Europe hit by Black Basta ransomware attack,"Car maker Hyundai Motor Europe suffered a Black Basta ransomware attack, with the threat actors claiming to have stolen three terabytes of corporate data.Hyundai Motor Europe is Hyundai Motor Company's European division, headquartered in Germany.BleepingComputer first learned of the attack in early January, but when we contacted Hyundai, we were told they were just experiencing IT issues.""Hyundai Motor Europe is experiencing IT issues, which the company is working to resolve as quickly as possible,"" Hyundai told BleepingComputer at the time.""Trust and security are fundamental to Hyundai's business and our priority is the protection of our customers, employees, investors, and partners.""However, after sharing additional information we had learned about data being stolen, Hyundai confirmed to BleepingComputer that they suffered a cyberattack.""Hyundai Motor Europe is investigating in a case in which an unauthorised third party has accessed a limited part of the network of Hyundai Motor Europe,"" Hyundai Motor Europe told BleepingComputer.""Our investigations are ongoing, and we are working closely with external cybersecurity and legal experts. Relevant local authorities have also been notified. Trust and security are fundamental to our business, and our priority is the protection of our customers, employees, investors, and partners.""The company did not specify what type of attack they suffered, but BleepingComputer learned the Black Basta ransomware operation conducted it in early January when they claimed to have stolen 3 TB of data from Hyundai Motor Europe.In an image seen by BleepingComputer, the threat actors shared lists of folders that were allegedly stolen from numerous Windows domains, including those from KIA Europe.While it is not known what data was stolen, the folder names indicate its related to various departments at the company, including legal, sales, human resources, accounting, IT, and management.Hyundai previously disclosed a data breach in April 2023 that impacted Italian and French car owners and those who booked a test drive.More recently, Hyundai MEA's X account was hacked to promote sites with crypto wallet drainers.Who is Black Basta?The Black Basta ransomware gang launched its operation in April 2022 and quickly launched a stream of double-extortion attacks.By June 2022, Black Basta had partnered with the QBot malware operation (QakBot) to drop Cobalt Strike for remote access on corporate networks. Black Basta would use this access to spread to other devices on the network, steal data, and ultimately encrypt devices.Since its launch, the threat actors have been responsible for a wide range of attacks, including those against the Toronto Library, Capita, American Dental Association, Sobeys, Knauf, and Yellow Pages Canada.A report from Corvus Insurance and Elliptic in November 2023 says that Black Basta is believed to have received over $100 million in ransom payments since its launch.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

"QR Code 'Quishing' Attacks on Execs Surge, Evading Email Security","The use of QR codes to deliver malicious payloads jumped in Q4 2023, especially against executives, who saw 42 times more QR code phishing than the average employee.February 8, 2024Email attacks relying on QR codes surged in the last quarter, with attackers specifically targeting corporate executives and managers, reinforcing recommendations that companies place additional digital protections around their business leadership.Making matters worse, phishing emails using QR codes (aka ""quishing"") can often get by spam filters, with attacks targeting users of Microsoft 365 and DocuSign successfully landing in email inboxes, according to a report published this week by Abnormal Security, a provider of cloud email security.In the fourth quarter of 2023, the average top executive in the C-suite saw 42 times more phishing attacks using QR codes compared to the average employee. Other managerial roles suffered an increase in attacks as well, although significantly smaller, with these non-C-suite executives encountering five times more QR-code-based phishing attacks, according to the company's report.Overall, the data demonstrates that attackers have executives â€” and other privileged users â€” in their sites, says Mike Britton, CISO for Abnormal Security.""If I'm an attacker, I want to attack the people that have the ability for me to get paid and have credentials that give me access to the most interesting information,"" he says. ""Or I want to pretend to be those people, because once again, social engineering requires that trust, [for a victim to think,] hey, this VP of sales or this VP of HR is asking me to do something, [making them] typically more likely ... to take action.""While QR codes have been around for three decades, they became much more popular during the pandemic, as restaurants and other businesses directed customers to contact-free and online ordering. In a business context, a top use case for QR codes is offering links to ease the sign-up process for multifactor authentication (MFA). Cyberattackers have hopped on: More than a quarter of QR code attacks (27%) in Q4 were fake notices of MFA, for example, while about one-in-five attacks (21%) were fake notifications about a shared document, according to Abnormal Security's report.Top executives see 42 times more attacks using QR codes than regular employees. Source: Abnormal SecurityBecause attackers hide their phishing link in an image, QR code phishing bypasses user suspicions and some email security products. In addition, malicious QR codes can be placed in physical spaces using a simple sticker, bypassing digital security altogether.""Attacks exploit users' inherent trust in QR codes, embedding them in everyday items like parking meters or posters,"" says Monique Becenti, director of product at mobile-security firm Zimperium. ""The success rate of phishing with QR codes will surpass traditional phishing methods because they often bypass users' typical suspicion triggers, such as typos in the URL, leading to a higher likelihood of scanning them.""Yet Another Way to Steal Exec's CredentialsFor the most part, quishing attackers who focus on executives are after the credentials â€” usernames and passwords â€” of privileged users. Credential phishing is the most popular form of email attack, accounting for 73% of all attacks through the vector and 84% of attacks using a QR code; and they often lead to more significant compromises, says Abnormal Security's Britton.""The primary goal is getting at a user to steal their credentials,"" he says. ""Once I have your credentials, I can do a lot more damage, and I can do a lot of lasting damage. If I have your credentials, I can log into your account, I can see who you've sent emails to, I can send emails pretending to be you, and I can create mail filter rules.""That last point is a common way to abuse mail credentials, Britton says. The attacker will create a blind carbon copy (BCC) rule that forwards all emails to the attacker's account.Further, ""threat actors also recognize that often multiple people have access to an executive's inbox, such as executive assistants,"" the report stated. ""Consequently, every individual who knows the login credentials for a VIP's inbox represents a potential entry point that can be exploited by an attacker.""Thwarting Quishing Takes Technology & Training the HumanThe good news is, since October, QR-code phishing has subsided to a large degree, after accounting for 22% of phishing attacks, according to human-risk management firm Hoxhunt. ""Since last October, we've seen evidence that email filters are catching up to the QR phishing technique,"" says Jon Gellin, threat team lead at Hoxhunt. ""As fewer of these attacks are bypassing email filters, there's been a resultant decrease in their popularity.""However, even if quishing subsides, it will remain a tool for attackers, much in the way that shortened URLs and image spam continue to be used in cyberattacks. The best way to protect users is to train them, Gellin says. About 5% of users respond to a phishing attack within the first few minutes, suggesting that a well-trained pool of employees can help blunt an attack.""As the QR phishing trend has shown, some threats will always slip past even the most sophisticated filters,"" he says. ""At that point, it's up to the human layer to have the skills and tools to deal with the threat effectively.""Training is important, but because a single failure can have a significant impact, technical controls are necessary, says Abnormal Security's Britton.""There, there are some phishing attacks that I've seen that even I have to get a second opinion from people because they look so real,"" he says. ""How do I expect an HR person to get that right every time? How do I expect an accounts payable person? How do I expect a financial analyst?""""Training is important, but we're going to fail, and it only takes one failure,"" he says.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security InspectionIT Zero Trust vs. OT Zero Trust: It's all about AvailabilityBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
Iran-Israel Cyber War Goes Global,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Iran-Israel Cyber War Goes GlobalWhat started off as posturing from the Islamic Republic has turned into more serious cyberattacks against the US, Albania, and more.February 8, 2024Iran's cyber conflict with Israel has reached global proportions, with cyberattacks against businesses and government agencies on other continents causing arguably as much ruckus as those in Israel itself.It's a classic case of cyber imitating life. While US military bases and international shipping routes are peppered by its proxy terrorist outfits â€” most notably, the dernier cri Houthis â€” Iran's cyber threat cloud has been spreading its attacks into the US and Europe, against targets perceived to be aligned with its bÃªte noire.In a report published this week, Microsoft characterized this global proliferation as a ""Phase 3"" in Iran's hebraic cyber offensive.""This is highly likely to be part of the Iranian government's strategic pressure campaign,"" says a threat intelligence analyst from Recorded Future's Insikt Group, who chose not to be named for this story. ""Tehran is hoping to influence governments directly and not [get] directly involved in the conflict via the ability to impact economies. They are highly likely aiming to influence business communities to pressure their governments to support a cessation of Israeli military activities in the Gaza Strip.""Among the latest victims of this Phase 3 pressure offensive: an Albanian government organization and Iran's military guard itself.The Latest in Iran's Global Cyber OffensiveThe most recent known case occurred on Feb. 1. Albania's Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) disclosed on Facebook that a cyberattack ""which aimed to damage INSTAT's data has caused the Internet services of the official website and email to be interrupted.""In an official statement, the country's National Authority for Electronic Certification and Cyber Security (AKCESK) clarified that the affected INSTATE systems ""are not currently classified as critical or important information infrastructure.""On Telegram, the Iranian APT commonly known as ""Homeland Justice"" told a somewhat different story. Claiming the attack for itself, it described the event as more extortion than denial-of-service (DoS), with more than 100 terabytes of population and geographic information system data copied and then deleted from the organization's servers.As Microsoft noted in its report, Homeland Justice has previously targeted Albania, alongside other countries perceived to be in support of Israel. In a series of Telegram posts, the group framed the stolen data in the wider context of Albania's support of ""the terrorists,"" including Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian dissident group with ties to Israel's secret service.Meanwhile, not one day after Albania's statistics snafu, Iran's cyberattack net once again reached US shores, when the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned six officials with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC).The action follows a December intrusion into Vision Series programmable logic controllers (PLCs), developed by the Israeli-American company Unitronics, and utilized in both countries' critical infrastructure.""US authorities took remarkably fast action to sanction multiple Iranian cyber officials associated with these attacks,"" says Scott Small, director of threat intel at Tidal Cyber. ""This could provide limited deterrence against future attacks, but we also know Iranian cyber actors are persistently intent on attacking US-based targets, especially government entities.""Though it might at first seem short-sighted for Iran to unnecessarily drag the US into a cyber conflict, the Insikt analyst suggests that it could be a well-calculated risk.""Iran has been trying to de-escalate a kinetic tit-for-tat to minimize the risk of US retaliation against its territory. It is possible more aggressive and more global cyber operations will allow them to mitigate that risk while still contributing to the anti-Israel agenda,"" they suggest.The Three Phases of the ConflictAccording to Microsoft, Iran's pseudo-cyber war against Israel can be split into three distinct phases.Phase 1, during the initial days following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack, was rather amateurish, the report claims. Iran-nexus groups performed light opportunistic attacks, leveraged pre-existing access to claim attacks against Israeli organizations, and repackaged old and publicly available data as new ""leaks.""Phase 2, beginning in mid-to-late October, ratcheted up the volume. The number of groups working actively against Israel rose from nine to at least fourteen. Iran conducted ten cyber-enabled influence operations in that month alone, alongside more coordinated and destructive campaigns. Still, much of the winnings from its most successful campaigns were overstated.In Phase 3 the attacks have become even more honed, utilizing more advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), targeting more significant businesses and critical infrastructure operators, and weaving in more effective messaging aimed at undermining Israeli morale and pressuring Israel's allies.""This concern will only increase heading further into election season, since we know Iran has regularly sought to interfere with past US votes,"" Small warns.If recent months are anything to go by, we won't know until it happens what the next Iranian cyberattack will look like.""Recent cases demonstrate that the whole range of attack methods are considered fair game for these cyber operations, including Web app exploits, credential harvesting, and even ransomware and cryptomining. This creates a wide range for potential disruptions to critical operations, plus potential fuel for influence operations whether or not the attacks cause notable material impact,"" Small says.Read more about:DR Global Middle East & AfricaAbout the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
How 'Big 4' Nations' Cyber Capabilities Threaten the West,"February 9, 2024COMMENTARYThere are four nations deemed by the US and UK governments to pose the greatest threat to the West. They're called the ""Big Four"": Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.Each nation has its own overarching threat behaviors and agenda to meet its ruling government's ambitions on the world stage. Russia's cyber-threat activities are primarily focused on offensive cyber operations, China's are focused on cyber espionage, Iran's on influence operations, and North Korea's on financial gain.Events of the 20th century, developments since the dawn of the millennium, and the intense geopolitics since the start of 2022 have contributed to recent actions taken by the Big Four. Industry analysts see plenty of evidence to link cybersecurity offenses around the globe to nation state-sponsored groups associated with these four countries.RussiaA multitude of geopolitical factors have influenced Russia's actions in recent years, including NATO's expansion east across Europe to Russia's borders and NATO's support for Ukraine.Russia is forming greater economic and military partnerships with China, Iran, and North Korea to boost its economy and resupply its military hardware. After Europe closed its door to Russian oil, the country had to sell its natural resources to developing Asian markets. As a result, India imported 40% of discounted oil from Russia in 2023, up from just 3% two years earlier. Strong economic dependencies often produce an uptick in cyber-espionage operations due to the need for foreign policy information surrounding these deals.As Russia is engaged in open warfare, the state has conducted a growing number of overt attacks. Reports indicate that 16 different ""families"" of wiper malware have been used against Ukraine over the past 12 months, up from just one instance in the previous two years. ESET senior researcher Anton Cherepanov stated, ""this is the most intense use of wipers in all computer history.""Notably, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom are the world's top donors of Ukrainian military aid and are also the most targeted nations outside of Ukraine.ChinaIn 2023, China emerged as the world's second great power, with extensive ambitions to further its influence by way of global infrastructure investment through the Belt and Road Initiative and political domination of East Asia. China is assessed to be the most advanced threat nation in terms of both cyberattacks and cyber-espionage capabilities. Its strategic interests reside in:Preserving the existence and legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by reunification with Taiwan.Protecting China's national interests, including expansion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.Asserting China's power globally.These strategic interests are realized in several key areas. First, in 2015, China announced its Made in China 2025 plan, which aims to advance China's manufacturing base by rapidly developing 10 high-tech industries. If China can create advanced semiconductors, the Taiwanese monopoly on semiconductor manufacturing will be severely undermined and thus one of the main deterrents for a possible Chinese invasion will be removed.China also aims to emerge on the world stage as a hard counter to Western (and particularly US) dominance. As former US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Gen. Keith Alexander said, China is undertaking ""the greatest transfer of intellectual wealth in history.""IranIran's modern political landscape began in 1979 with the toppling of the monarchy and the accession of the religious-based Islamic Republic. Since then, Iran has cemented itself as a strong state with great influence in the Middle East.Iran's cyber characteristics fall into two categories: offensive operations and actions to exert influence to bolster the government. Since June 2022, multiple Iranian threat groups have deployed cyber-enabled influence operations (IO). This combines offensive operations with messaging in a coordinated and manipulative fashion to further Iran's geopolitical objectives by shifting perceptions, behaviors, and decisions towards the regime.In addition, tensions have been significantly high with Israel, leading to economic and covert military support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian areas.In 2022, Iran's cyber capabilities were considered the most basic of the Big Four. However, in 2023, Iranian state actors used increasingly sophisticated tradecraft, rolling out a larger number of custom implants and becoming much faster at exploiting the latest exploits. These demonstrate a clear jump in Iranian cyber capabilities.North KoreaA state of war has technically existed between North Korea and South Korea since 1950: The countries never signed a peace deal in the Korean War, only a ceasefire agreement. The North Korean leadership sees the state's and the Kim regime's survival as under direct threat from the United States and its allies. To shield itself from the perceived threat of imminent invasion, the Kim government has built a deterrent by aiming thousands of artillery pieces at South Korea's capital, Seoul, and by developing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles.This aggressive tactic has led to strict economic sanctions, inhibiting the outside world from trading with North Korea. In response, the state has conducted numerous financially motivated attacks and crypto heists to steal money to prop up the government and fund weapons. It also runs intellectual property theft operations. The United States is by far the most targeted nation, accounting for over 40% of targeting over the past 12 months. Second and third are South Korea and Japan respectively.What Lies Ahead?In the next 12 months, around two-thirds of eligible citizens in democratic nations will have the opportunity to vote in presidential or national elections. So, cyber-influence campaigns targeting elections are expected to increase throughout 2024 by all Big Four nations.About the Author(s)You May Also LikeDevSecOps: The Smart Way to Shift LeftFeb 14, 2024Making Sense of Security Operations DataFeb 21, 2024Your Everywhere Security Guide: 4 Steps to Stop CyberattacksFeb 27, 2024API Security: Protecting Your Application's Attack SurfaceFeb 29, 2024Securing the Software Development Life Cycle from Start to FinishMar 06, 2024Threat Terrain of the Modern Factory: Survey of Programmable Assets and Robot SoftwarePixelle's OT Security Triumph with Security Inspection2023 Snyk AI-Generated Code Security ReportBuyer's Guide: Choosing a True DevSecOps Solution for Your Apps on AWSUnderstanding AI Models to Future-Proof Your AppSec Program",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
Deepfake Democracy: AI Technology Complicates Election Security,"February 9, 2024Recent events, including an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated deepfake robocall impersonating President Biden urging New Hampshire voters to abstain from the primary, serve as a stark reminder that malicious actors increasingly view modern generative AI (GenAI) platforms as a potent weapon for targeting US elections.Platforms like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini (formerly Bard), or any number of purpose-built Dark Web large language models (LLMs) could play a role in disrupting the democratic process, with attacks encompassing mass influence campaigns, automated trolling, and the proliferation of deepfake content.In fact, FBI Director Christopher Wray recently voiced concerns about ongoing information warfare using deepfakes that could sow disinformation during the upcoming presidential campaign, as state-backed actors attempt to sway geopolitical balances.GenAI could also automate the rise of ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" networks that attempt to develop audiences for their disinformation campaigns through fake news outlets, convincing social media profiles, and other avenues â€” with the goal of sowing discord and undermining public trust in the electoral process.Election Influence: Substantial Risks & Nightmare ScenariosFrom the perspective of Padraic O'Reilly, chief innovation officer for CyberSaint, the risk is ""substantial"" because the technology is evolving so quickly.""It promises to be interesting and perhaps a bit alarming, too, as we see new variants of disinformation leveraging deepfake technology,"" he says.Specifically, O'Reilly says, the ""nightmare scenario"" is that microtargeting with AI-generated content will proliferate on social media platforms. That's a familiar tactic from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the company amassed psychological profile data on 230 million US voters, in order to serve up highly tailored messaging via Facebook to individuals in an attempt to influence their beliefs â€” and votes. But GenAI could automate that process at scale, and create highly convincing content that would have few, if any, ""bot"" characteristics that could turn people off.""Stolen targeting data [personality snapshots of who a user is and their interests] merged with AI-generated content is a real risk,"" he explains. ""The Russian disinformation campaigns of 2013â€“2017 are suggestive of what else could and will occur, and we know of deepfakes generated by US citizens [like the one] featuring Biden, and Elizabeth Warren.""The mix of social media and readily available deepfake tech could be a doomsday weapon for polarization of US citizens in an already deeply divided country, he adds.""Democracy is predicated upon certain shared traditions and information, and the danger here is increased balkanization among citizens, leading to what the Stanford researcher RenÃ©e DiResta called 'bespoke realities,'"" O'Reilly says, aka people believing in ""alternative facts.""The platforms that threat actors use to sow division will likely be of little help: He adds that, for instance, the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has gutted its quality assurance (QA) on content.""The other platforms have provided boilerplate assurances that they will address disinformation, but free speech protections and lack of regulation still leave the field wide open for bad actors,"" he cautions.AI Amplifies Existing Phishing TTPsGenAI is already being used to craft more believable, targeted phishing campaigns at scale â€” but in the context of election security that phenomenon is event more concerning, according to Scott Small, director of cyber threat intelligence at Tidal Cyber.""We expect to see cyber adversaries adopting generative AI to make phishing and social engineering attacks â€” the leading forms of election-related attacks in terms of consistent volume over many years â€” more convincing, making it more likely that targets will interact with malicious content,"" he explains.Small says AI adoption also lowers the barrier to entry for launching such attacks, a factor that is likely to increase the volume of campaigns this year that try to infiltrate campaigns or take over candidate accounts for impersonation purposes, among other potentials.""Criminal and nation-state adversaries regularly adapt phishing and social engineering lures to current events and popular themes, and these actors will almost certainly try to capitalize on the boom in election-related digital content being distributed generally this year, to try to deliver malicious content to unsuspecting users,"" he says.Defending Against AI Election ThreatsTo defend against these threats, election officials and campaigns must be aware of GenAI-powered risks and how to defend against them.""Election officials and candidates are constantly giving interviews and press conferences that threat actors can pull sound bites from for AI-based deepfakes,"" says James Turgal, vice president of cyber-risk at Optiv. ""Therefore, it is incumbent upon them to make sure they have a person or team in place responsible for ensuring control over content.""They also must make sure volunteers and workers are trained on AI-powered threats like enhanced social engineering, the threat actors behind them and how to respond to suspicious activity.To that end, staff should participate in social engineering and deepfake video training that includes information about all forms and attack vectors, including electronic (email, text and social media platforms), in-person and telephone-based attempts.""This is so important â€” especially with volunteers â€” because not everyone has good cyber hygiene,"" Turgal says.Additionally, campaign and election volunteers must be trained on how to safely provide information online and to outside entities, including social media posts, and use caution when doing so.""Cyber threat actors can gather this information to tailor socially engineered lures to specific targets,"" he cautions.O'Reilly says long term, regulation that includes watermarking for audio and video deepfakes will be instrumental, noting the Federal government is working with the owners of LLMs to put protections into place.In fact, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just declared AI-generated voice calls as ""artificial"" under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), making use of voice cloning technology illegal and providing state attorneys general nationwide with new tools to combat such fraudulent activities.""AI is moving so fast that there is an inherent danger that any proposed rules may become ineffective as the tech advances, potentially missing the target,"" O'Reilly says.

In fact, according to a recent study by Avanade, in which we surveyed more than 3,000 business and IT executives globally, 92% of respondents agree that their organization needs to shift to an AI-first operating model this year to stay competitive.But rather than shifts, I see sprints. Many organizations are reacting to the hype, rushing to satisfy board curiosity and deploying AI somewhere (anywhere) to check a box. They're often jumping ahead of the important and tough work of finding the right problem for the technology (be it a new revenue stream, higher profitability, process optimization, or cost savings), understanding their AI readiness, and designing a road map that matches it.The technology industry at large has some important but tough work ahead, too, ensuring that we're leading by example and designing and applying AI responsibly. After all, just because we can use AI for everything doesn't mean that we should.Closing the Gap, Mitigating Bias, and MoreSo, as we all absorb the mania we were exposed to in 2023, I recommend that individuals, organizations, and the overall technology industry focus on these five priorities in 2024.Closing the gap between AI advancements and government regulations. Although the United States government and the European Union announced policies around the use of AI, we're still living with a Wild West-type framework. Advancements in the application of AI will require access to tons of data, and this will clash with privacy concerns. And yet we must address how to maintain privacy in a way that still allows innovation to happen. I believe there's a huge opportunity for technology firms to do what matters and come forward to invest in privacy-preserving technologies.Mitigating bias and ensuring ethical use. Mitigating bias in AI is essential for fairness and equality, as biased systems can perpetuate social inequalities. Accurate and reliable outcomes depend on unbiased AI, especially in critical applications like law enforcement and hiring. Public trust in AI technology hinges on its perceived fairness and lack of bias. Legal and regulatory compliance as AI governance evolves mandates vigilance against bias. I believe that ethical AI practice is crucial for a company's reputation and commercial success, reflecting a commitment to global and cultural sensitivity.Strengthening explainability. Closely tied to ethical use is that AI and everything surrounding it must be explainable, auditable, and defensible. Technology professionals must be able to tell the story of how the data is calculated, linked, and transformed to those who are asked to sign off on projects and budgets. Stakeholders will be wary of what they don't understand and what doesn't seem transparent, especially around fairness and bias.Developing AI talent. What expertise do you need to be a practitioner of AI? Yes, deep programming skills and a solid foundation in mathematics are table stakes, but gone are the days when you can throw something to a programmer in the corner who doesn't interact with people. An AI specialist needs to possess soft skills and collaborative capabilities. They'll be working with legal, finance, marketing, and human resources, and they must communicate in an effective and straightforward way.Embedding AI across the business responsibly. AI is a strategic business capability that can and should impact all parts of an organization, and it's going to foster collaboration like you've never seen. You must therefore have a business strategy for its use, assess the readiness of your people, processes, and platforms, and put a framework in place for its responsible use. This is a critical component of understanding and managing risk tolerance, being compliant, and most importantly, building confidence and trust in AI technologies.As the hype of last year settles, AI's transformative potential is there for the taking in 2024, if we can get these five priorities right.

Cybercrime gang targeted jobseekers across Asia,"Crime gang targeted jobseekers across Asia, looted two million email addressesThat listing for a gig that looked too good to be true may have been carrying SQL injection codeSingapore-based infosec firm Group-IB has detected a group that spent the last two months of 2023 stealing personal info from websites operated by jobs boards and retailers websites across Asia.The actors, dubbed â€œResumeLootersâ€ by Group-IB, used SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks to steal databases from the sites. That tactic produced over two million email addresses, plus names, phone numbers, dates of birth, and employment history.""The initial victims that we identified were mainly job search websites. Additionally, the group focuses on selling data stolen from recruiting agencies,"" Nikita Rostovcev, a senior analyst from the cyber security firm, told The Reg.Rostovcev declined to name the retailers hit by the looters, but confirmed that they included ""e-commerce companies of various sizes, including some that are quite popular in their respective markets.""- Interpol's latest cybercrime intervention dismantles ransomware, banking malware servers- Either the FBI is recruiting in Iran â€“ or some govt Google ad buyers are getting a lousy deal- H-1B fraud consultancies grow, with application abuse openly discussed online- Volt Typhoon not the only Chinese crew lurking in US energy, critical networksWhile SQL injection was the gangâ€™s main tool, XSS scripts were used on four legitimate job search websites. The threat actors prepared fake profiles on job search sites that would inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by victims, allowing the attacker to steal information, manipulate content, or perform other malicious actions. Group-IB believes the main goal was to steal admin credentials, but found no evidence the gang succeeded with that effort.""The presence of this code on these pages does not necessarily imply that it was executed on every device. However, it does indicate the persistence of the attackers and their attempts to inject their XSS scripts into all possible input fields on the targeted websites. Group-IB has also found evidence that the XSS script was executed on some of the visitors' devices,"" noted Group-IBâ€™s infosec analysts.Although all compromised websites were found at the end of 2023, Group-IB believes the attacks began as early as January of the same year.Some 70 percent of victims were in the APAC region, with only a minority elsewhere. The largest number of hacked websites came from India (12), with Taiwan (10), Thailand (9) and Vietnam (7) following close behind.Group-IB identified a malicious server that contained the logs of multiple penetration testing tools. The group favored open source tools â€“, like sqlmap, Acunetix, the Beef Framework, X-Ray, Metasploit, ARL, and Dirsearch.Commands on the server led Group-IB to believe that the threat actors were attempting to gain shell access on target systems to download and execute additional payloads and hunt for additional data while in control of a victim's server. However it's unknown if ResumeLooters succeeded.The threat actor's server contained an open directory in which the crims stored stolen source code pages, cookies and notes about victims. They failed to disable its directory listing, however, which led to its discovery.Group-IB traced the email address employed by ResumeLooters in their campaign to two different Chinese-language Telegram accounts, one of which listed the stolen data for sale. One account was named ""æ¸—é€æ•°æ®ä¸­å¿ƒ,"" which translates to ""Penetration Data Center"" in simplified Chinese. The other was called ""ä¸‡å›½æ•°æ®é˜¿åŠ›"" which translates to ""World Data Ali.""The Reg was told that many of the comments in the code were made in Chinese â€“ supporting an assumption the attackers hail from the Middle Kingdom.Rostovcev commented that it is believed the threat actors targeted their home region, as it is more familiar to them.

MoqHao Android Malware Evolves with Auto-Execution Capability,"Threat hunters have identified a new variant of Android malware called MoqHao that automatically executes on infected devices without requiring any user interaction.""Typical MoqHao requires users to install and launch the app to get their desired purpose, but this new variant requires no execution,"" McAfee Labs said in a report published this week. ""While the app is installed, their malicious activity starts automatically.""The campaign's targets include Android users located in France, Germany, India, Japan, and South Korea.MoqHao, also called Wroba and XLoader (not to be confused with the Windows and macOS malware of the same name), is an Android-based mobile threat that's associated with a Chinese financially motivated cluster dubbed Roaming Mantis (aka Shaoye).Typical attack chains commence with package delivery-themed SMS messages bearing fraudulent links that, when clicked from Android devices, lead to the deployment of the malware but redirect victims to credential harvesting pages impersonating Apple's iCloud login page when visited from an iPhone.In July 2022, Sekoia detailed a campaign that compromised at least 70,000 Android devices in France. As of early last year, updated versions of MoqHao have been found to infiltrate Wi-Fi routers and undertake Domain Name System (DNS) hijacking, revealing the adversary's commitment to innovating its arsenal.The latest iteration of MoqHao continues to be distributed via smishing techniques, but what has changed is that the malicious payload is run automatically upon installation and prompts the victim to grant it risky permissions without launching the app, a behavior previously spotted with bogus apps containing the HiddenAds malware.What's also received a facelift is that the links shared in the SMS messages themselves are hidden using URL shorteners to increase the likelihood of the attack's success. The content for these messages is extracted from the bio (or description) field from fraudulent Pinterest profiles set up for this purpose.MoqHao is equipped with several features that allow it to stealthily harvest sensitive information like device metadata, contacts, SMS messages, and photos, call specific numbers with silent mode, and enable/disable Wi-Fi, among others.McAfee said it has reported the findings to Google, which is said to be ""already working on the implementation of mitigations to prevent this type of auto-execution in a future Android version.""The development comes as Chinese cybersecurity firm QiAnXin revealed that a previously unknown cybercrime syndicate named Bigpanzi has been linked to the compromise of Android-based smart TVs and set-top boxes (STBs) in order to corral them into a botnet for conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.The operation, active since at least 2015, is estimated to control a botnet comprising 170,000 daily active bots, most of which are located in Brazil. However, 1.3 million distinct Brazilian IP addresses have been associated with Bigpanzi since August 2023.The infections are made possible by tricking users into installing booby-trapped apps for streaming pirated movies and TV shows through sketchy websites. The campaign was first disclosed by Russian antivirus vendor Doctor Web in September 2023.""Once installed, these devices transform into operational nodes within their illicit streaming media platform, catering to services like traffic proxying, DDoS attacks, OTT content provision, and pirate traffic,"" QiAnXin researchers said.""The potential for Bigpanzi-controlled TVs and STBs to broadcast violent, terroristic, or pornographic content, or to employ increasingly convincing AI-generated videos for political propaganda, poses a significant threat to social order and stability.""",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
FBI's latest defense of warrantless S. 702 snooping is China,"FBI: Give us warrantless Section 702 snooping powers â€“ or China winsNever mind the court orders obtained to thwart Volt Typhoon botnetAnalysis The FBI's latest PR salvo, as it fights to preserve its warrantless snooping powers on Americans via FISA Section 702, is more big talk of cyberattacks by the Chinese government.During a US House subcommittee meeting last week on cyber threats from Beijing, FBI boss Christopher Wray told lawmakers that ""702 is the greatest tool the FBI has to combat PRC hacking groups."" PRC being People's Republic of China.Wray cited an example he's used previously about how, last year, Section 702 of America's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allowed the FBI to observe Chinese government snoops trying to break into an unnamed US transportation hub and take action.""We were able to quickly notify the entity and share technical details, which enabled them to be able to kick the Chinese off the networks before harm could be done â€” before some of the more apocalyptic scenarios we've been talking about here could transpire,"" Wray told the House select committee hearing on competition with China.Section 702 is a contentious amendment to FISA that is supposed to allow US intelligence agencies to spy on foreign intelligence targets located overseas. In reality, the private communications of some US persons may be warrantlessly swept up in these Section 702 dragnets and analyzed by agents, which alarms privacy campaigners.Failure to reauthorize Section 702 ... would be a form of unilateral disarmament in the face of the Chinese Communist PartyThe amendment is due to expire by April 19 this year unless Congress votes to reauthorize it. Lawmakers have the option of tweaking the rules so that, for instance, warrants are required in certain circumstances or some other protections are put in place. The Feds aren't a fan of some of the changes to 702 right now under consideration, as they argue things like warrant requirements for all those queries they run each month will slow down and hamper investigations.""Failure to reauthorize Section 702, or for that matter, reauthorizing it in a way that severely restricted our ability to use it, would be a form of unilateral disarmament in the face of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Wray continued. ""I can assure the American people, the Chinese government is not tying its hands behind its back. It's going the other direction, and we need to do the same.""At yesterday's press briefing on China's Volt Typhoon crew infiltrating US critical infrastructure facilities' IT networks, Cynthia Kaiser, deputy assistant director for the FBI's cybersecurity division, revealed her agents, using spying powers granted under Section 702, ""also identified other Chinese-state cyber actors"" breaking into vital American systems.""And in fact, we only know about many critical infrastructure entities compromised by the Chinese, because of FBI FISA 702 collections,"" she added.Later on the call, when asked if Section 702 was used in the FBI's operation to remotely kill Volt Typhoon's KV botnet, Kaiser said she couldn't get into specifics. ""But I want to end by noting how critical 702 is to all of our operations, especially within cyberspace.""We don't know all of the details, and don't have a seat in the war room where the FBI and other US agencies fight nation-state snoops on the regular.But we do know, specific to the Volt Typhoon takedown: The FBI obtained warrants that allowed it to remotely search US-based routers that had been infected with backdoor malware by China. The Feds wanted to hunt for information about Beijing's espionage efforts before wiping that malicious code from the compromised devices.Keyword here being ""warrants."" It is possible for the FBI to get court orders to conduct searches on remote equipment and perform other special operations, and it has done so many times in the past. The Feds draw the line at having to get a warrant for each and every query they run that may involve a US citizen, resident, or organization, it seems.MotivationWithin the FISA Section 702 debate, the FBI is fighting to retain its powers to conduct, without a warrant, surveillance that may accidentally or otherwise vacuum up US persons' data â€“ powers that have been abused millions of times by the FBI. The Feds last year said auditors determined FBI agents had achieved a 96 percent compliance rate for FISA queries.Drilling deeper, FISA Section 702 allows the FBI and its fellow federal organizations to monitor foreigners' electronic communications beyond America's borders. But if these emails, texts, and phone calls are with or about US persons, those individuals and organizations' data can get pulled in as well for analysis, along with anyone those US persons also talked to.It's a wide net, and this has led to extreme cases of misuse â€” especially from the FBI, which has used 702 powers to conduct warrantless surveillance on US citizens including protesters, political campaign donors, and elected officials including a US senator.In terms of cyber value, we've seen little evidence of queries providing valueBecause of these abuses, and, you know, the constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures, there's been a big push to reform Section 702 and require all US intelligence agencies to obtain a warrant before conducting a US person query.Currently, there are four bills in Congress to reauthorize Section 702. But only two of them, the Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act (aka the Protect Liberty Act) and the even broader-reaching Government Surveillance Reform Act of 2023, include a warrant requirement.""In terms of cyber value, we've seen little evidence of queries providing value, and in cases where it has, the Protect Liberty Act's exceptions for queries with consent (which critical infrastructure being targeted would certainly provide), queries focused on malware code, and metadata queries (which can map out unusual network traffic and intrusion attempts) mean that proposed reforms wouldn't inhibit operations,"" Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Security and Surveillance Project, told The Register.""The bottom line is the FISA 702 debate isn't about whether the authority is valuable, it's whether reforms unduly interfere with that value,"" he added. ""The answer is a resounding no.""- Volt Typhoon not the only Chinese crew lurking in US energy, critical networks- Congress told how Chinese goons plan to incite 'societal chaos' in the US- Four more months of Section 702 snooping slipped into $890B US defense budget bill- As NSA buys up Americans' browser records, Uncle Sam is asked to simply knock it offStill, arguing the Feds can't fight terrorism and other serious crimes perpetrated by foreign governments without warrantless searches of Americans seems like a shell game at best, especially in light of the FBI's Volt Typhoon disruption, which involved court-issued search warrants.""I think this is the same issue that has come up again and again in the government's rhetoric,"" Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, told The Register.""They continue to speak to what they view as the overall value of Section 702 surveillance without making the case as to why this necessitates violating the constitutional rights of Americans. And I think it continues to be a disingenuous argument when it comes to cyberthreats from China.""One week it's needed to combat fentanyl, the next it's international polluters, or cyberthreats from ChinaOther organizations also advocating for reining in government snooping powers agree with this assessment.""Remember the old television serials in which the antagonists often were monsters of the week, villains who'd show up for one episode to be vanquished by the heroes just in time for them to face a new monster in the next episode?"" Electronic Frontier Foundation senior policy analyst Matthew Guariglia said.This, he said, sounds an awful lot like Uncle Sam's strategy to convince the public of the need to renew Section 702.""One week it's needed to combat fentanyl, the next it's international polluters, or cyberthreats from China, or Russia,"" he told The Register. Maybe the Feds are just that busy.Ultimately, this surveillance tool, intended to be used overseas for national-security reasons, ""has morphed into an invasive domestic spying program which can and has been used to investigate regular law enforcement matters in the US without a warrant,"" Guariglia said.

New Coyote Trojan Targets 61 Brazilian Banks with Nim-Powered Attack,"Sixty-one banking institutions, all of them originating from Brazil, are the target of a new banking trojan called Coyote.""This malware utilizes the Squirrel installer for distribution, leveraging Node.js and a relatively new multi-platform programming language called Nim as a loader to complete its infection,"" Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said in a Thursday report.What makes Coyote a different breed from other banking trojans of its kind is the use of the open-source Squirrel framework for installing and updating Windows apps. Another notable departure is the shift from Delphi â€“ which is prevalent among banking malware families targeting Latin America â€“ to an uncommon programming language like Nim.In the attack chain documented by Kaspersky, a Squirrel installer executable is used as a launchpad for a Node.js application compiled with Electron, which, in turn, runs a Nim-based loader to trigger the execution of the malicious Coyote payload by means of DLL side-loading.The malicious dynamic-link library, named ""libcef.dll,"" is side-loaded by means of a legitimate executable named ""obs-browser-page.exe,"" which is also included in the Node.js project. It's worth noting that the original libcef.dll is part of the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF).Coyote, once executed, ""monitors all open applications on the victim's system and waits for the specific banking application or website to be accessed,"" subsequently contacting an actor-controlled server to fetch next-stage directives.It has the capability to execute a wide range of commands to take screenshots, log keystrokes, terminate processes, display fake overlays, move the mouse cursor to a specific location, and even shut down the machine. It can also outright block the machine with a bogus ""Working on updates..."" message while executing malicious actions in the background.""The addition of Nim as a loader adds complexity to the trojan's design,"" Kaspersky said. ""This evolution highlights the increasing sophistication within the threat landscape and shows how threat actors are adapting and using the latest languages and tools in their malicious campaigns.""The development comes as Brazilian law enforcement authorities dismantled the Grandoreiro operation and issued five temporary arrest warrants and 13 search and seizure warrants for the masterminds behind the malware across five Brazilian states.It also follows the discovery of a new Python-based information stealer that's related to the Vietnamese architects associated with MrTonyScam and distributed via booby-trapped Microsoft Excel and Word documents.The stealer ""collects browsers' cookies and login data [...] from a wide range of browsers, from familiar browsers such as Chrome and Edge to browsers focused on the local market, like the Cá»‘c Cá»‘c browser,"" Fortinet FortiGuard Labs said in a report published this week.",emerging threats and attack techniques,emerging threats and attack techniques,TRUE
"Americans lost record $10 billion to fraud in 2023, FTC warns","The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says Americans lost over $10 billion to scammers in 2023, marking a 14% increase in reported losses compared to the previous year.To put this into context, Chainalysis says ransomware gangs also had a record year, with ransomware payments having reached over $1.1 billion in 2023.Over 2.6 million consumers filed fraud reports with the FTX the previous year, a figure almost identical to 2022. Imposter scams emerged as the most frequently reported fraud category, with notable upticks in business and government impersonation reports.Following closely behind were online shopping scams, trailed by reports concerning prizes, sweepstakes, and lotteries, as well as investment scams and business or job opportunity schemes.""Consumers reported losing more money to investment scamsâ€”more than $4.6 billionâ€”than any other category in 2023. That amount represents a 21% increase over 2022,"" the FTC said.""The second highest reported loss amount came from imposter scams, with losses of nearly $2.7 billion reported. In 2023, consumers reported losing more money to bank transfers and cryptocurrency than all other methods combined.""The FTC added 5.4 million consumer reports to its Consumer Sentinel Network (Sentinel) secure online database last year, with more than 1.1 million reports of identity theft received through the agency's IdentityTheft.gov website.However, the data shared today by the FTC reflects just a fraction of the actual harm inflicted by scammers in 2023 since most frauds are never reported.Those who fell victim to fraud can report incidents at ReportFraud.ftc.gov or file identity theft reports at IdentityTheft.gov.After being included in the FTC's Sentinel database, the reports are made available to roughly 2,800 federal, state, local, and international law enforcement professionals. They help investigators track down fraudsters, making it easier to discover trends and educate the public against scam attempts.A full breakdown of reports received in 2023, including state and metropolitan area stats, can be found on the FTC's data analysis site at ftc.gov/exploredata.""Digital tools are making it easier than ever to target hard-working Americans, and we see the effects of that in the data we're releasing today,"" said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.Commentsitsonlym3 - 1 day agolooks like you have a typo/missing word(s) here, ""The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says Americans over $10 billion to scammers in 2023"".serghei - 1 day agoFixed, thanks!",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
VexTrio network of hijacked websites used to spread malware,"Meet VexTrio, a network of 70K hijacked websites crooks use to sling malware, fraudSome useful indicators of compromise right hereMore than 70,000 presumably legit websites have been hijacked and drafted into a network that crooks use to distribute malware, serve phishing pages, and share other dodgy stuff, according to researchers.This mesh of compromised sites is known as VexTrio, and has been mostly flying under the radar since its inception in 2017 or earlier, though lately more details about the operation have emerged.The process is simple, and mirrors the traffic distribution systems, or TDSes, that the marketing world uses to direct netizens to particular sites based on their interests or similar.In the case of VexTrio, tens of thousands of websites are compromised so that their visitors are redirected to pages that serve up malware downloads, show fake login pages to steal credentials, or perform some other fraud or cyber-crime.It's said at least 60 affiliates are involved in the network in some way. Some partners provide the compromised websites, which send marks to VexTrio's own TDS infrastructure, which in turn directs those victims' browsers to harmful pages. The TDS typically only redirects people if they meet certain criteria.VexTrio takes a fee from the crooks running the fraudulent sites for directing web traffic their way, and the miscreants who provided the compromised websites in the first place get a cut. We're told the TDS also sends netizens to scam websites operated by the VexTrio crew itself, allowing the criminals to profit directly from their fraud.In its January global threat index, Check Point on Friday labeled VexTrio a ""considerable"" security risk, citing its reach and sophisticated setup.""VexTrio is yet another reminder of how commercially-minded the [cybercrime] industry has become,"" Check Point veep of research Maya Horowitz commented.This follows an extensive investigation by Infoblox published last month, with the help of infosec bod Randy McEoin, that concluded VexTrio was the ""single most pervasive threat"" to its own customers. Of the TDS crew's 70,000-odd known domains, references or links to almost half were apparently spotted in those customers' networks.In its technical report, co-written by McEoin and staff researcher Christopher Kim, Infoblox disclosed signs of compromise that you can look out for on your own IT environments.The security shop has been tracking VexTrio for two years, and first flagged up the group in June 2022. Back then, however, ""we didn't fully appreciate the breadth of their activities and depth of their connections within the cybercrime industry,"" the biz said last month.- Malware loader lowdown: The big 3 responsible for 80% of attacks so far this year- Raspberry Robin devs are buying exploits for faster attacks- LockBit shows no remorse for ransomware attack on children's hospital- Fortinet's week to forget: Critical vulns, disclosure screw-ups, and that toothbrush DDoS attack claimInterestingly enough, and perhaps as an indicator of the TDS's reach, one strain of malware pushed via VexTrio is SocGholish, aka FakeUpdates, which topped Check Point's list of the most prevalent malware in January, affecting four percent of observed organizations worldwide. This downloader even outpaced Qbot last month, which had a global impact of three percent, we're told.SocGholish, which is written in JavaScript, is usually triggered when visiting a compromised website, and targets Windows machines, pretends to offer a browser update that when accepted and run by a mark infects their PC with backdoor malware, ransomware, and other stuff. In January, SocGholish was observed bringing GootLoader, Dridex, NetSupport, DoppelPaymer, and AZORult onto victims' machines.Also, according to Check Point's report, and perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone who follows news headlines, ransomware crews had a decent start to 2024. This part deserves a big caveat, however. The security firm bases this info on about 200 ransomware groups' leak sites, and these aren't always the most reliable measure of which organizations have suffered infections, and by whom.Victims' names are frequently removed by the crims during negotiations, or sometimes they never even make the sites if they pay up quickly. Plus, extortionists aren't always the most honest folks. So take these numbers with a healthy amount of salt.According to Check Point's metrics: LockBit3 was responsible for 20 percent of the claimed attacks, followed by 8Base with 10 percent, and Akira with nine percent. The last two of those three are relative newbies who made a name for themselves in 2023 and show no sign of going away. Â®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
"New Fortinet RCE bug is actively exploited, CISA confirms","CISA confirmed today that attackers are actively exploiting a critical remote code execution (RCE) bug patched by Fortinet on Thursday.The flaw (CVE-2024-21762) is due to an out-of-bounds write weakness in the FortiOS operating system that can let unauthenticated attackers execute arbitrary code remotely using maliciously crafted HTTP requests.Admins who can't immediately deploy security updates to patch vulnerable appliances can remove the attack vector by disabling SSL VPN on the device.CISA's announcement comes one day after Fortinet published a security advisory saying the flaw was ""potentially being exploited in the wild.""While the company has yet to share more details regarding potential CVE-2022-48618, CISA has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, warning that such bugs are ""frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors"" posing ""significant risks to the federal enterprise.""The cybersecurity agency also ordered U.S. federal agencies to secure FortiOS devices against this security bug within seven days, by February 16, as required by the binding operational directive (BOD 22-01) issued in November 2021.Confusing disclosuresFortinet patched two other critical RCE vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109) in its FortiSIEM solution this week.Initially, the company denied that the CVEs were real and claimed they were duplicates of a similar flaw (CVE-2023-34992) fixed in October.However, Fortinet's disclosure process was very confusing, with the company first denying the CVEs were real and claiming they were mistakenly generated due to an API issue as duplicates of a similar flaw (CVE-2023-34992) fixed in October.As later revealed, the bugs were discovered and reported by Horizon3 vulnerability expert Zach Hanley, with the company eventually admitting the two CVEs were variants of the original CVE-2023-34992 bug.Since remote unauthenticated attackers can use these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable appliances, it's strongly advised to secure all Fortinet devices as soon as possible immediately.For instance, Fortinet said on Wednesday that the Chinese Volt Typhoon hacking group used two FortiOS SSL VPN flaws (CVE-2022-42475 and CVE-2023-27997) in attacks where they deployed the Coathanger custom malware.Coathanger is a remote access trojan (RAT) that targets Fortigate network security appliances and was recently used to backdoor a military network of the Dutch Ministry of Defence.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

This was just the start of hell week.The story immediately attracted our attention since it's not too often we hear about two maximum severity bugs being disclosed on the same day, impacting a major security product like FortiSIEM.However, that's what happened on Tuesday with both CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109 appearing in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The confusing part was that both vulnerabilities were submitted by Fortinet, but both linked back to a separate, earlier October advisory, revealing no details about these seemingly huge new flaws.So, hungry vultures we are, we swooped down and picked that story up immediately, shooting Fortinet a request for clarity on the matter and why it hadn't published details on them.Many readers will likely have seen that story since it was among the most-read for a few days, but some may be wondering why we didn't update it with the latest available information per our usual high standards.It took Fortinet more than 73 hours to issue us with an official response. It came through after we started writing this on February 9.For those not in tune with how the media works, this is very, very poor form on the vendor's part. A response given to a publication even beyond just 24 hours, especially with no explanation as regards the delay, is considered unprofessional.In the meantime, the company has issued two separate statements to our competitors explaining what exactly has gone wrong with this disclosure. We didn't publish this for a number of editorial-related reasons, and prior to the statement issued today, we've only received apologies for the radio silence. Not even copies of the statements given to other publications.If a 24-hour wait is considered unprofessional, more than three days is a slap in the face.So, all of that is why our coverage hasn't been as timely as we, and you as readers, expect from us.But, since we're providing an overview of the vendor's week, what actually happened here was that it absolutely bungled the disclosure of these vulnerabilities.Firstly, Fortinet backtracked and said these weren't vulnerabilities at all, instead explaining that they were issued in error and were duplicates of the single vulnerability mentioned in the aforementioned October advisory â€“ CVE-2023-34992.Then, within hours of this, the company backtracked again saying that yes, actually, these are two new vulnerabilities â€“ two bypasses for October's CVE-2023-34992. This came after the researcher credited with the discoveries published the email from Fortinet confirming the findings were indeed actual vulnerabilities. Fortinet retained its 10/10 severity ratings, while the NVD downgraded both to 9.8.Fortinet's statement from today addressed the 'why' behind the disclosure, blaming it on ""exceptional circumstances.""According to a Fortinet spokesperson:Timely and ongoing communications with our customers is a key component in our efforts to help protect and secure their organization. Fortinet PSIRT policy diligently balances our commitment to the security of our customers and our culture of researcher collaboration and transparency.There are instances where confidential advance customer communications can include early warning on advisories to enable customers to further strengthen their security posture, prior to the advisory being publicly released to a broader audience. This process follows best practices for responsible disclosure to provide our customers timely information to help them make informed decisions.Due to exceptional circumstances that include the premature dissemination of mitigation guidance and in an effort to help protect our customers, Fortinet distributed its monthly advisory on February 8 ahead of its anticipated February 13 publication date to provide important details to customers considering these circumstances. For more on Fortinet's responsible disclosure process, visit the Fortinet Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT).That damned toothbrush storySecurity-minded readers or otherwise, you will all have surely seen the story circulating this week about Java-based, malware-laden toothbrushes being recruited in a 3 million-strong botnet that's DDoS-ing Switzerland.Unlike many major national newspapers, and even some well-read tech press, we brushed over this one as something didn't quite seem right about it. For Fortinet, it was yet another mess to clean up.The Swiss newspaper that originally published the story claimed a director of systems engineering at [you can guess the company] told their reporter during an interview that the toothbrush DDoS-ing was actually happening in the real world.After many strongly worded suspicions that the claim was false, and a litany of memes pasted over tech social media, Fortinet responded by saying the claim was simply just lost in translation and that there was no actual massive toothbrush botnet. It was just a hypothetical situation.The writer at the Swiss German daily who first reported the story snapped back, disputing Fortinet's response, saying: ""What the Fortinet headquarters in California is now calling a 'translation problem' sounded completely different during the research: Swiss Fortinet representatives described the toothbrush case as a real DDoS at a meeting that discussed current threats.""Stefan Zuger, the Fortinet engineer who gave the interview, provided specific details of the DDoS incident, including for how long the attack had been ongoing and the potential damage to the unnamed website it affected, the reporter claimed.The Swiss journo also said the article was proofread by Fortinet before publication and nothing in the report was corrected by the vendor.TGIF, right?The weekend will doubtless be a welcome reprieve, especially for members of Fortinet's publicity team who will have been working tirelessly to undo all the company-wide errors from the past week.To their credit, they will also be dealing with the response to the reports that were also published this week about Chinese cyberspies exploiting FortiGate vulnerabilities using custom malware.We at El Reg lovingly welcome errors and messes of all kinds. We hate slow news days, so long may it continueâ€¦ just as long as we're not ignored while it's happening. Â®",news and industry updates,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
US govt ups bounty on Hive ransomware gang members to $15M,"Uncle Sam sweetens the pot with $15M bounty on Hive ransomware gang membersHonor among thieves about to be put to the testThe US government has placed an extra $5 million bounty on Hive ransomware gang members â€“ its second such reward in a year. And it also comes a little over 11 months since the FBI said it had shut down the criminal organization's network.On Thursday, the State Department reaffirmed it will pay up to $10 million for information leading to the identification and/or location of anyone holding or held ""key"" leadership positions in the organized crime crew. The FBI has also put up an additional $5 million award for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of any person ""conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in Hive ransomware activity.""The multi-million-dollar rewards come a little more than a year after the FBI, working with international law enforcement, seized control of the gang's servers and websites following a seven-month covert surveillance operation.The FBI was as a result ultimately able to provide decryption keys to more than 1,300 current and previous victims of Hive around the globe, saving them a collective $130 million in ransomware payments and ""crippling Hive's ability to sting again,"" FBI director Christopher Wray boasted at the time.A few days later, the State Department offered a $10 million reward for intel on Hive ransomware criminals' identities and whereabouts, even seeking information on Hive members ""acting under the direction or control of a foreign government.""The crew, which appeared in 2021, is believed to have ties to the Russian state.- FBI smokes ransomware Hive after secretly buzzing around gang's network for months- Uncle Sam slaps $10m bounty on Hive while Russia ban-hammers FBI, CIA- As lawmakers mull outlawing poor security, what can they really do to tackle online gangs?- New kids on the ransomware block in 2023: Akira and 8Base lead dozens of newbiesChainalysis, in its 2023 review published this week, estimated that ransomware crews raked in more than $1 billion in extorted cryptocurrency payments from victims last year, compared to $567 million in 2022.The cryptocurrency analytics firm also noted that the Hive takedown likely played a non-trivial role in the 2022 drop in ransomware payments, which otherwise have been escalating since 2019.The FBI's $130 million estimate ""may not tell the whole story,"" the report noted, because it only takes into account ransoms directly averted by the decryptor keys. For its part, Chainalysis reckoned the Hive bust more likely averted at least $210.4 million in ransomware payments.""During the six months the FBI infiltrated Hive, total ransomware payments across all strains hit $290.35 million,"" Chainalysis observed.

Middle East Cybersecurity Teams Want More Budget,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Middle East Cybersecurity Teams Want More BudgetMeanwhile, cyber threats are spiking in the region.February 9, 2024More than half of cybersecurity leaders in the Middle East cite a lack of funding as the top challenge in doing their jobs.According to new research from Deloitte, some 51% of respondents cited the lack of funding, compared to 36% of security leaders worldwide.That said, cybersecurity spending in the Middle East and Africa is set to top $238 billion in 2024, according to Gartner â€” a huge rise from a projected $2.6 billion in 2022 â€” in light of increased attacks against targets in the regions.Guy Rosenthal, vice president of product at DoControl, says that is evidence of the focus and concern about cybersecurity in markets such as the Middle East.""It's very common even in markets like Europe and Eastern Asia for organizations to prioritize cybersecurity only after they reach a certain size,"" he says. ""Now that organizations in the Middle East are gaining attention from threat actors, they have to up their game â€” and therefore their spending on cybersecurity.""Easier to Start FreshSpending on cybersecurity varies from organization to organization, Rosenthal says, but ramping up a cybersecurity program is easier nowadays, and without the the technical debt of long-standing cyber programs.""[These security leaders] are free to explore and embrace new innovations like enterprise browsers to solve multiple problems like secure Web gateway, zero trust, etc. instead of embracing complex â€” and at times expensive â€” secure access service edge implementations,"" he says. ""There are pros and cons to starting fresh, and the pros, like being able to nimbly embrace innovation, are often overlooked.""Jose Seara, CEO and founder at DeNexus, says adoption of tools built on automation and artificial intelligence can be easier and faster to deploy, as well as more effective in detecting new generations of cyber threats.""With evidence-based data showing where their business and infrastructures are most vulnerable, what types of cyberattacks have the highest probability, and what's the potential return of risk mitigation strategies, [organizations] can optimize their cybersecurity budget to address the most acute cybersecurity weaknesses,"" Seara says.Cyber Training Is CrucialNearly 70% of respondents in the Deloitte report say training and certification programs are key to engaging, retaining, and developing cybersecurity talent.Tariq Ajmal, cyber leader at Deloitte Middle East, says training programs and certifications are available in the Middle East, especially with the prominence of the English language in the region's business ecosystem â€” particularly in cybersecurity.""Organizations across the region need to ensure their people get the opportunity to upskill themselves and evolve to keep up with the continuously changing landscape,"" Ajmal says.

Canada to ban the Flipper Zero to stop surge in car thefts,"The Canadian government plans to ban the Flipper Zero and similar devices after tagging them as tools thieves can use to steal cars.The Flipper Zero is a portable and programmable pen-testing tool that helps experiment with and debug various hardware and digital devices over multiple protocols, including RFID, radio, NFC, infrared, and Bluetooth.Users have been demonstrating Flipper Zero's features in videos shared online since its release, showcasing its capacity to conduct replay attacks to unlock cars, open garage doors, activate doorbells, and clone various digital keys.""Criminals have been using sophisticated tools to steal cars. And Canadians are rightfully worried,"" Canadian Industry Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne tweeted on Wednesday.""Today, I announced we are banning the importation, sale and use of consumer hacking devices, like flippers, used to commit these crimes.""Champagne's announcement comes after a national summit on combatting auto theft hosted this week by the Government of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario.According to the Canadian government, around 90,000 vehicles (or one car every six minutes) are reported stolen every year, with car theft resulting in $1 billion in annual losses, including insurance costs for fixing and replacing stolen cars.The figures shared by the Canadian government when describing the car theft surge currently impacting Canada align with the most recent data shared by the Statistics Canada government agency, which shows an increasing number of car theft reports since 2021.Canadian police also reported that motor vehicle theft had the most significant impact on an increase in the national Crime Severity Index in 2022.The Canadian government's Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) department (and the country's industry and commerce regulator) says that it will ""pursue all avenues to ban devices used to steal vehicles by copying the wireless signals for remote keyless entry, such as the Flipper Zero, which would allow for the removal of those devices from the Canadian marketplace through collaboration with law enforcement agencies.""Flipper Devices: Cars built after the 1990s are safeWhile the Canadian government insists that the Flipper Zero is one of the reasons behind the current surge of car thefts in the country, Flipper Devices, the company behind the devices, says the gadget can't be used to steal vehicles built within the last 24 years.""Flipper Zero can't be used to hijack any car, specifically the ones produced after the 1990s, since their security systems have rolling codes,"" Flipper Devices COO Alex Kulagin told BleepingComputer.""Also, it'd require actively blocking the signal from the owner to catch the original signal, which Flipper Zero's hardware is incapable of doing.""Flipper Zero is intended for security testing and development and we have taken necessary precautions to ensure the device can't be used for nefarious purposes.""Amazon has also banned the sale of the Flipper Zero since April 2023 for being a card skimming device after the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency began seizing incoming Flipper Zero purchases in March 2023 due to its alleged use by criminals.CommentsEndangeredPootisBird - 1 day agoClassic, a penetration testing tool used more for crime than for legitimate purposesJimscard - 1 day agoExcept it canâ€™t do most of the things described in the article.

UK to replace physical biometric immigration cards with e-visas,"By 2025, Britain is set to ditch physical immigration status documents such as Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs) and Biometric Residence Cards (BRCs) in a bid to make its borders digital, which is in-line with developed countries like Australia.Understand what the new Home Office development means for existing BRP and BRC holders, and what you need to do.e-Visas to replace biometric residence cardsPresently, students, workers, immigrants and their dependents from non-EU countries residing in the UK are eventually issued Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs), cards which are proof of their immigration status in the country. Much like e-Passports, these plastic cards contain a chip that can be used by a Border Force officer to cryptographically verify the authenticity of the document itself and a person's identity via biometrics (facial photograph and fingerprints) stored in that chip.Some developed nations such as Australia, much like the UK, also collect biometrics from immigrants but in contrast, do not issue physical cards or in-passport vignettes (physical visa stickers and stamps). Instead, applicants are granted an e-visa that can be verified online and serves a digital proof of their immigration status.All UK BRPs issued up until today are set to expire December 31, 2024â€”even if your immigration status is valid beyond that date, or has no time limit on it (i.e. permanent residents with an 'Indefinite Leave to Remain'). The reason for this being, while the UK was a part of the European Union (EU), regulations required the government to implement next-generation encryption technology into its immigration documents, and as such the UK planned on rolling out enhanced cards after the end of this year, while phasing existing ones out.Since post-Brexit, however, EU requirements no longer apply to the UK and the Home Office has decided to discontinue BRPs altogether by 2025.""You will not need a BRP from 1 January 2025. You'll be able to prove your immigration status online, without a BRP,"" reads a webpage on the GOV.UK website.""[UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI)] will update their information on how to prove your immigration status in early 2024. You do not need to do anything and your immigration status will not be affected.""Advantages and disadvantagesAn eVisa is an electronic record of a person's immigration status and provides customers with the ability to view and prove their immigration status digitally, explains Home Office. It removes the need for physical documents such as, the Biometric Residence Permit (BRP), ink stamps and visa vignette stickers in a customer's passport or the Biometric Residence Card (BRC).This also saves an applicant the inconvenience associated with submitting their physical passport to a consulate for visa issuance, waiting for weeks, and subsequently arranging its collection.Despite their drawbacks, a key advantage of physical documents, especially chip-based ones, is their ability to be reliably verified offline, given the basics of public-key encryption. When combined with security features such as UV holograms and watermarks built into these documents, the dependence on an always-online system is practically eliminated.In other words, one can even use an NFC-powered smartphone app to securely read and verify the authenticity of a BRP card (or an ePassport) without being connected to the Internet. The card holder's personal details and photographâ€”all digitally signed by the issuing government, are stored in the chip itself. Despite this, passengers have faced chaos at airports in the past when eGates went down.What happens should the internet-connected IT systems used by the airlines and border officials face an outage? In such a case, how can the identity of arriving passengers with eVisas, as opposed to physical biometric documents, be reliably verified?What will the new process look like?Because we are already in February, those with BRP cards expiring over the next few months may be wondering what they need to do.BleepingComputer reached out to the Home Office to better understand the upcoming changes and what will the new process to prove and renew immigration status look like.""EVisas provide secure confirmation of someone's UK immigration status and make it easier for those who need to check status, such as employers and landlords, via online services,"" a Home Office spokesperson told BleepingComputer.""Replacing physical immigration documents with eVisas by 2025 is a key part of the transformation and digitisation of the border and immigration system, delivering enhanced security and cost-savings for the UK public and greater convenience for customers and status checkers.""UKVI accounts to open for allOur understanding is that the physical biometric cards and printed visa stickers will entirely be replaced by e-visas, similar to the ones issued by Australia, where immigrants currently use the Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) system to prove their status digitally.Similarly, starting 2025, existing UK BRP holders are expected to register for a UKVI online account to view or prove immigration status.For a few years now, proving your Right to Work to an employer, or your Right to Rent to a landlord has already been a digital process, conducted through the GOV.UK website by using details from your physical document:Furthermore, millions of people with an 'EU settled status' or those who have used the 'UK Immigration: ID Check' app already hold a UKVI account and use e-visas to prove their right to enter and live in the UK.The upcoming changes are expected to extend these conveniences to nationals of all countries.An eVisa, much like a physical BRP, will be securely linked to its holder's unique biometric information to safeguard against identity fraud.Immigrants who already have an eVisa do not need to do anything while changes are being implemented, but are advised to keep their UKVI account up to date with current personal particulars, including changed contact details or details of a new passport.Starting this summer, the Home Office plans on providing airlines, train and ferry operators with integrated secure access to passenger immigration information to enhance border security and reduce unnecessary passenger delays.With the move towards e-Visas, public government bodies like the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the NHS in England and Wales will be able to automatically and securely access an individual's status when they apply to access benefits and public services.It is important to note, until the new system gets a green light, the process to renew an existing BRP or replace a lost one remains the same until the end of this year.Home Office customers including existing BRP and physical document holders should monitor www.gov.uk/evisa over the next few months for upcoming information on what they need to do and when.While the UK government is on track to deliver a digital border and immigration system, including plans to trial contactless entry using just facial recognition, there are no plans at the moment to replace physical passports with digital equivalents, such as those piloted by Finland, BleepingComputer understands.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

Kenya Detected Over 1B Cyber Threats in Q4,"Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East & Africa.Kenya Detected Over 1B Cyber Threats in Q4Officials attribute the massive volume to the nation's enhanced cyber threat monitoring capabilities.February 9, 2024Kenyan officials said more than one billion cyber threats hit the nation in the final quarter of last year.That's a massive jump from the 123 million cyber threats detected in the previous quarter. The Communications Authority of Kenya attributed the increase to a recent enhancement of the country's cyber-threat monitoring capabilities, as well as the increased exploitation of vulnerabilities by attackers targeting the increased number of Internet devices in Kenya.Local media reports said of the 1.2 billion detections, 13.2 million contained malware, and 9.7 million were brute-force entry attempts. It was unclear how many of the cyberattacks detected were successful.Edward Kisiang'ani, principal secretary for Broadcast and Telecommunications at the Kenyan Ministry of ICT, said the government is upgrading its threat detection systems, and training staff to deal with such threats.

Ivanti discloses fifth vulnerability,", doesn't credit researchers who found itSoftware company's claim of there being no active exploits also being questionedIn disclosing yet another vulnerability in its Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA gateways, Ivanti has confused the third-party researchers who discovered it.Researchers at watchTowr blogged today about not being credited with the discovery of CVE-2024-22024 â€“ the latest in a series of vulnerabilities affecting Ivanti gateways as the vendor continues to develop patches for supported versions.The high-severity authentication bypass flaw only affects a limited number of supported versions, unlike the zero-days that came before it, and, according to Ivanti, it was discovered in-house.However, watchTowr claims its researchers were the first to bring Ivanti's attention to the bug on February 2, publishing screenshots of the emails exchanged between it and Ivanti as proof.Commenting on the above excerpt from Ivanti's advisory, watchTowr said: ""Today, Friday February 9, 2024, we are pleased to see that Ivanti has released an advisory for this vulnerability.""We did find this comment a little curious, but perhaps we have a new set of colleagues?"" It went on to say it was ""surprised"" about seeing the missing credit, but assumes it was done without malice.The vulnerability itself, to the delight of admins across the land, isn't as serious as the others that were disclosed over the past few weeks.In addition to fewer versions being vulnerable, those that applied the updated mitigation provided on January 31 are automatically protected.Those who applied the patch to their devices when it became available and completed a factory reset of their device(s) are also protected. There is no evidence to suggest it's been actively exploited as a zero-day, Ivanti said, although that's been disputed.The limited versions impacted by the vulnerability are:-Ivanti Connect Secure (version 9.1R14.4, 9.1R17.2, 9.1R18.3, 22.4R2.2 and 22.5R1.1)-Ivanti Policy Secure (version 22.5R1.1)-ZTA (version 22.6R1.3)A quick recapSimilar to Fortinet recently, Ivanti's been having a tough time with security of late.- Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security hole- Ivanti releases patches for VPN zero-days, discloses two more high-severity vulns- Ivanti and Juniper Networks accused of bending the rules with CVE assignments- Ivanti zero-day exploits explode as bevy of attackers get in on the actIn mid-January came the first reports of two zero-days in Ivanti's products being exploited by attackers that were either pro-China or state-sponsored by Beijing.Since then, Ivanti has continued to work on developing patches in accordance with its staggered schedule, which is to say it's developing patches for the versions with the most users, and working down from there. In the meantime, it released a mitigation to keep people safe while they wait for patches.This patching schedule was supposed to conclude on February 19, but in announcing the first patch at the end of January, Ivanti said this has been delayed.What it also announced alongside the first patch, and it would be funny if it weren't so serious, was that in fixing the first two zero-days, it found another two vulnerabilities, one of which was also exploited as a zero-day.Better yet, Ivanti also said attackers had devised workarounds for the mitigation it provided, so it was forced to make a new one and this is still working to the best of our knowledge.So that's four big security holes in the space of a few weeksâ€¦ today's takes it to five.The zero-days were under ""mass exploitation"" status within days, since proof of concept (PoC) code was published before Ivanti could develop patches. It was suspected at the time that 1,700 devices had backdoors implanted in them.Underlining the severity of the situation, CISA issued its second emergency directive last week instructing federal agencies to disconnect the products entirely. This followed an initial advisory adding the first two zero-days to its ""must-patch"" list the same day Ivanti disclosed them.The UK's NCSC was also prompted into action today, publishing its own advisory urging immediate patches for all five Ivanti vulnerabilities.

Hands-on Review: Myrror Security Code-Aware and Attack-Aware SCA,"IntroductionThe modern software supply chain represents an ever-evolving threat landscape, with each package added to the manifest introducing new attack vectors. To meet industry requirements, organizations must maintain a fast-paced development process while staying up-to-date with the latest security patches. However, in practice, developers often face a large amount of security work without clear prioritization - and miss a significant portion of the attack surface altogether.The primary issue arises from the detection and prioritization methods used by traditional Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools for vulnerabilities. These methods lack the organizational-specific context needed to make an informed scoring decision: the score, even if critical, might not actually be critical for an organization because its infrastructure works in a unique way - affecting the actual impact the vulnerability might have.In other words, since these tools depend on a relatively naive methodology to determine a vulnerability's risk, they end up with primarily irrelevant vulnerability scores - making determining which vulnerabilities to address first much harder.Furthermore, they do not address many supply chain attacks, such as typosquatting, malicious code injection, CI/CD attacks, etc. This oversight misleads Application Security (AppSec) teams and developers into focusing on less critical issues, thus delaying the development process and leaving the organization vulnerable to significant attack vectors.Myrror Security develops innovative solutions to these challenges by revolutionizing how organizations detect, prioritize and remediate their supply chain risks. Myrror's platform ensures that AppSec and engineering teams tackle the right issues at the right time by utilizing binary-to-source analysis for every third-party package in the codebase. Unlike traditional SCA tools that assess impact using version-level detection in manifest files, Myrror uses a proprietary reachability vulnerability analysis algorithm. This algorithm identifies which vulnerabilities are actually reachable in production, thus enabling Myrror to prioritize security issues accurately.This Platform Review will guide you through the entire Myrror user journey, from the initial SCM integration to the remediation plan generator, and provide a concise overview of the innovations Myrror Security has introduced to prevent alert fatigue, empower your organization to work more effectively and protect it from the threats of the modern software supply chain. To get a personalized demo, visit their website here.Getting Started and SetupMyrror is designed for easy installation on the organization's existing source code management platform. When Myrror is connected to your SCM, a discovery process of the organization's dependencies begins. The organization can later select specific repositories for active vulnerability and supply chain attack scanning, providing a prioritized overview of identified risks.The Discovery SectionThis section enables you to take stock of the supply chain risk associated with your codebase and determine the actual threat landscape you're exposed to from your open-source dependencies.The Repositories tab shows you all the issues in each monitored repository and allows you to choose which to monitor and which to ignore. This will allow you to remove some noise associated with repositories that are not in active use, will soon be deprecated, or are simply irrelevant. This tab serves as the control panel over all of your repositories. It complements the issues screen by pointing you toward your most at-risk repositories - allowing for a project- or application-level ""bird's eye"" view of the threats.The Dependencies tab aggregates every open-source dependency in your codebase and creates a graph of all the repositories in which each one is used. This key overview allows you to get a complete picture of the open-source libraries your organization relies upon. Despite the immense increase in open-source repositories in basically every software project, organizations don't have any control over external dependencies; taking inventory of what is being used in your code is the first step to controlling what's happening.The Myrror DashboardOnce the installation is complete and the user chooses the repositories to scan, the Myrror dashboard is populated with information about your repositories, their dependencies, and the issues they contain. When the user chooses to monitor additional repositories or connect more SCM sources, the dashboard is automatically updated with more information about the new codebases.The dashboard provides high-level insights into the issues across the entire set of the organization's codebase, including:- Detection Status- Issues by category- Dependencies with Security Status- The Riskiest Repository- Issues per code language,- Status of Remediation- Out-of-data Dependencies- And moreThese charts and graphs generate a detailed and complete overview, providing organizations with clear insights into areas requiring the most work. Note the repository filter on the top right - this allows specific teams to get accurate information about their work and the repositories they are in charge of and export only the relevant data for them.The Issues ScreenThis is the core of the Myrror Security platform. Here, all your issues are prioritized and flagged according to their actual severity, reachability, and exploitability for a clear understanding of what to tackle next. Various parameters are organized into columns, offering more profound insights into each specific issue.Among these parameters, the reachability column sets Myrror apart from traditional SCA platforms. It assesses whether the issue is actually reachable in production, which factors into the prioritization - ensuring reachable vulnerabilities can be tackled first.But the platform doesn't stop at prioritizing vulnerabilities according to reachability - it also considers whether this is a direct or indirect dependency, whether a fix is available to remediate the issue, and whether an exploit has been confirmed to exist in the wild. All of these parameters help the platform prioritize issues accurately and reliably.You can see all the following pieces of information about each vulnerability:- Severity (taking all the above factors into account)- Origin- Reachability- Dependency File(s)- Category - Vulnerability / Supply Chain Attack (see more in the Detecting Supply Chain Attacks section)- Exploit Availability- Fix Availability- Dependency Relationship- First Seen- Original CommitFilters (including a repository filter) are available here too, along with an option to export the table and download insights for report creation. This assists security teams in maintaining records in local storage and generating internal audit reports. These reports, emailed to the user, contain comprehensive information directly from the platform that can be shared with other team members and stakeholders.Note that there are 3 different tabs available on this screen:- The ""All"" tab contains all the issues combined, providing data insights in a single page about the overall supply chain threat landscape - including vulnerabilities and attacks.- The ""recommended"" tab contains the specific issues recommended for remediation per severity and reachability - essentially your ""go-to"" pane when deciding what to tackle first.- Finally, the ""Low Risk"" tab has issues that you can deal with at a later point in time.Each issue also has its in-depth analysis, with insights on the impact, scope, and origin of the issues shown on one screen. This detailed overview provides external links to the CVE to learn more about it, as well as information about the affected repositories and a concrete remediation plan to ensure swift action can be taken on each issue.The primary tabs available on this screen are:- Details - a primary overview of the vulnerability or supply chain attack- Affected Repositories - a list of all repositories that depend on this package, allowing you to ""connect the dots"" across the entire monitored codebase- Remediation Plan - Myrror calculates the optimal path of remediation, ensuring that the smallest amount of newly-introduced vulnerabilities end up in the codebase after the remediation process is complete- Attack Overview (see next section for more details)Detecting Supply Chain AttacksKeep in mind that Myrror does more than just detect vulnerabilities - it also detects various forms of supply chain attacks - including but not limited to:- Typosquatting- Dependency Confusion- Malicious Code In Repo / Code Injection- CI/CD AttackWhen it detects those attacks, the detection mechanism and remediation plan might not be as straightforward as normal vulnerabilities. In those cases, Myrror will show a more in-depth analysis of the attack, enabling practitioners to grasp the situation and pinpoint the concrete link in the chain that's at fault. See below for an example of Myrror's analysis of a code injection attack:The Remediation Plan GeneratorPlanning your remediation efforts typically requires comprehending the new threats introduced during patching. In most cases, applying a patch results in a new set of vulnerabilities due to the new dependencies (and their transitive dependencies) it introduces.For every monitored repository, Myrror simplifies the issue remediation process by automatically calculating the number of fixes available for all the issues, how many new vulnerabilities will be introduced during the remediation process, and how many issues will remain at the end.ConclusionAppSec teams suffer from profound alert fatigue today, driven by an overwhelming amount of security issues and a lack of clear prioritization of what to work on first. In addition, most teams are completely unaware of the supply chain attacks they are exposed to and have no clear path for detecting them or offering proper remediation.Myrror's Reachability-based prioritization offers a way out of vulnerability hell. At the same time, their binary-to-source analysis mechanism enables detection of more than just simple vulnerabilities - and allows you to defend against a host of supply chain attacks.You can book a demo to learn more on their website here.",marketing,emerging threats and attack techniques,FALSE
MacOS Targeted by New Backdoor Linked to ALPHV Ransomware,"February 9, 2024Researchers have discovered a new backdoor targeting macOS that appears to have ties to an infamous ransomware family that historically targets Windows systems.Researchers at Bitdefender say the so-called Trojan.MAC.RustDoor is likely linked to BlackCat/ALPHV. The newly discovered backdoor is written in Rust coding language and impersonates an update for Visual Studio code editor.Bitdefender in its advisory said there have been multiple variants of the new backdoor, and that it has been in action for at least three months.The macOS malware gathers data from the Desktop and Documents folders, along with user notes, and then compresses the information into a ZIP archive and sends it to a command-and-control (C2) server.""While the current information on Trojan.MAC.RustDoor is not enough to confidently attribute this campaign to a specific threat actor, artifacts and IoCs (indicators of compromise) suggest a possible relationship with the BlackBasta and (ALPHV/BlackCat) ransomware operators,"" Bitedefender researcher Andrei Lapusneau wrote in the company's report. ""Specifically, three out of the four command and control servers have been previously associated with ransomware campaigns targeting Windows clients.""The researcher also noted the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware is likewise written in Rust.

Raspberry Robin malware evolves with early access to Windows exploits,"Recent versions of the Raspberry Robin malware are stealthier and implement one-day exploits that are deployed only on systems that are susceptible to them.One-day exploits refer to code that leverages a vulnerability that the developer of the impacted software patched recently but the fix has either not been deployed to all clients or it has not been applied on all vulnerable systems.From the moment the vendor discloses the vulnerability, which usually comes with publishing a patch, threat actors rush to create an exploit and use it before the fix propagates to a large number of systems.According to a report from Check Point, Raspberry Robin has recently used at least two exploits for 1-day flaws, which indicates that the malware operator either has the capability to develop the code or has sources that provide it.Raspberry Robin backgroundRaspberry Robin is a worm that Red Canary, a managed detection and response company, first identified in 2021. It spreads primarily through removable storage devices such as USB drives to establish a foothold on infected systems and facilitate the deployment of additional payloads.Since its discovery, Raspberry Robin has continuously evolved, adding new features, evasion techniques, and adopting several distribution methods. One example of evasion trick it implemented was to drop fake payloads to mislead researchers.Check Point reports that it has observed an uptick in Raspberry Robin's operations starting October 2023, with large attack waves targeting systems worldwide.A notable switch in recent campaigns is the use of the Discord platform to drop malicious archive files onto the target, likely after emailing the links to the target.The archives contain a digitally signed executable (OleView.exe) and a malicious DLL file (aclui.dll) that is side-loaded when the victim runs the executable, thus activating Raspberry Robin in the system.Targeting n-day flawsWhen Raspberry Robin is first run on a computer, it will automatically attempt to elevate privileges on the device using a variety of 1-day exploits.Check Point highlights that the new Raspberry Robin campaign leverages exploits for CVE-2023-36802, and CVE-2023-29360, two local privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Microsoft Streaming Service Proxy and the Windows TPM Device Driver.In both cases, the researchers say, Raspberry Robin started exploiting the flaws using a then-unknown exploit less than a month after the security issues were disclosed publicly, on June 13 and September 12, 2023.As illustrated in the timeline diagram below, Raspberry Robin exploited the two flaws before security researchers first published proof of concept exploit code for the two flaws.Specifically, regarding CVE-2023-36802, which enables attackers to escalate their privileges to the SYSTEM level, Cyfirma reported that an exploit had been available for purchase on the Dark Web since February 2023, a full seven months before Microsoft acknowledged and addressed the issue.This timeline suggests that Raspberry Robin acquires 1-day exploits from external sources almost immediately after their disclosure, as their cost as zero days is likely too much even for larger cybercrime operations.Check Point found evidence that points to this theory as well, since the exploits used by Raspberry Robin were not embedded into the main 32-bit component, but deployed as external 64-bit executables, and also lack the heavy obfuscation typically seen with this malware.New evasion mechanismsCheck Point's report also highlights several advancements in the latest Raspberry Robin variants, which include new anti-analysis, evasion, and lateral movement mechanisms.To evade security tools and OS defenses, the malware now attempts to terminate specific processes like 'runlegacycplelevated.exe,' related to Use Account Control (UAC), and patches the NtTraceEvent API to evade detection by Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).Moreover, Raspberry Robin now checks if certain APIs, like 'GetUserDefaultLangID' and 'GetModuleHandleW', are hooked by comparing the first byte of the API function to detect any monitoring processes by security products.Another interesting new tactic is the implementation of routines that use APIs like 'AbortSystemShutdownW' and 'ShutdownBlockReasonCreate' to prevent system shutdowns that could interrupt the malware's activity.To conceal the command and control (C2) addresses, the malware first randomly engages with one of the 60 hard-coded Tor domains pointing to well-known sites to make initial communications appear benign.Finally, Raspberry Robin now uses PAExec.exe instead of PsExec.exe to download the payload directly from the hosting location. This decision was likely made to increase its stealth, as PsExec.exe is known to be misused by hackers.The researchers believe that Raspberry Robin will keep evolving and add new exploits to its arsenal, seeking code that has not been released publicly. Based on observations during the malware analysis, it is likely that the operators of the malware does not create is connected to a developer that provides the exploit code.Check Point's report provides a list of indicators of compromise for Raspberry Robin, which consists in hashes for the malware, multiple domains in the Tor network, and Discord URLs for downloading the malicious archive.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a commentNot a member yet?

New RustDoor macOS malware impersonates Visual Studio update,"A new Rust-based macOS malware spreading as a Visual Studio update to provide backdoor access to compromised systems uses infrastructure linked to the infamous ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware gang.The campaign delivering the backdoor started since at least November 2023 and is still underway distributing newer variants of the malware.Written in Rust, the malware can run on Intel-based (x86_64) and ARM (Apple Silicon) architectures, say researchers at cybersecurity company Bitdefender, who are tracking it as RustDoor.Potential link to ransomware operationsWhile analyzing RustDoor, malware researchers at Bitdefender discovered that the malware communicated with four command and control (C2) servers.Looking at threat intelligence data, the analysts found that three of them had been used in attacks potentially linked to ransomware attacks from an ALPHV/BlackCat affiliate.However, the researchers highlight that this is insufficient evidence to confidently link the use of RustDoor to a particular threat actor and that ""artifacts and IoCs [indicators of compromise] suggest a possible relationship with the BlackBasta and ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware operators.""With cybercriminals having less freedom in choosing their infrastructure and being restricted to hosting services that provide anonymity and condone illegal activity, it is common for multiple threat actors to use the same servers for attacks.While encryptors for the macOS system exist, builds for Apple M1 from LockBit created before December 2022, there are no public reports at this time of ransomware attacking Apple's operating system.Most operations target Windows and Linux systems as enterprise environments use servers running these operating systems.Distribution detailsRustDoor is distributed primarily as an updater for Visual Studio for Mac, Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE) for the macOS platform, which will be discontinued this year on August 31.The macOS backdoor is delivered under multiple names, including 'zshrc2,' 'Previewers,' 'VisualStudioUpdater,' 'VisualStudioUpdater_Patch,' 'VisualStudioUpdating,' 'visualstudioupdate,' and 'DO_NOT_RUN_ChromeUpdates'.According to Bitdefender, the malware has been under active distribution and have been undetected for at least three months.The researchers discovered three versions of the malware, which come as FAT binaries that include Mach-O files for both x86_64 Intel and ARM architectures but do not come bundled in typical parent files such as Application Bundles or Disk Image.Bitdefender says this atypical distribution method reduces the campaign's digital footprint and the likelihood of security products flagging the backdoor as suspicious.Backdoor capabilitiesIn a report this week, the researchers say that RustDoor has commands to control the compromised system and to exfiltrate data, and it can persist on the device by modifying system files.After infecting a system, the malware communicates with command and control (C2) servers using specific endpoints for registration, task execution, and data exfiltration.The commands supported by the malware include the following:- ps: Lists running processes, useful for monitoring system activity.- shell: Executes arbitrary shell commands, giving attackers direct control.- cd: Changes the current directory, allowing navigation through the file system.- mkdir: Creates a new directory, useful for organizing stolen data or malware components.- rm: Removes files, potentially for deleting important files or cleaning up traces of the malware.- rmdir: Removes directories, similar to rm but for directories.- sleep: Pauses execution for a set time, possibly to evade detection or synchronize actions.- upload: Sends files to a remote server, used for exfiltrating stolen data.- botkill: Terminates other malware processes, possibly to eliminate competition or free system resources.- dialog: Displays messages or prompts to the user, potentially for phishing or to execute commands with user privileges.- taskkill: Ends specified processes, useful for stopping security software or other processes interfering with malware.- download: Retrieves files from a remote server, used for bringing additional malware components or updates onto the infected system.The backdoor uses Cron jobs and LaunchAgents to schedule its execution at specific times or when the user logs in, thus making sure it survives system reboots.Moreover, it modifies the ~/.zshrc file to execute in new terminal sessions or add it to the Dock with system commands, which helps it blend in with legitimate applications and user activities.Bitdefender notes that there are at least three variants of RustDoor, the earliest one seen since early October 2023.The next one was seen November 22 and appeared to be a testing version that preceded an updated version observed on November 30, which includes ""a complex JSON configuration as well as an embedded Apple script used for exfiltration"" of files with specific extensions.The researchers provide a list of known indicators of compromise for RustDoor, which includes binaries, download domains, and URLs for the four command and control servers discovered.Post a Comment Community RulesYou need to login in order to post a

Ransomware Groups Claim Hits on Hyundai Motor Europe and a California Union,"The unrelated cyberattacks both occurred in January.February 9, 2024Hyundai Motor Europe and a California union separately this week revealed they had suffered cyberattacks last month and lost data to the respective threat actors.Black Basta, a group that first appeared in 2022 as a double-extortion operator, claimed to have stolen 3TB of data from Hyundai Motor Europe. The carmaker has not confirmed it suffered a ransomware attack, nor the boasts by Black Basta.""Hyundai Motor Europe is investigating in a case in which an unauthorised third party has accessed a limited part of the network of Hyundai Motor Europe,"" stated Hyundai. ""Our investigations are ongoing, and we are working closely with external cybersecurity and legal experts.""Meanwhile, another group affiliated with ransomware activity, LockBit, claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 1000 in California.The union released a statement on Facebook confirming that it experienced a network disruption on Jan. 18. Its statement appeared to hint that the attack was ransomware-related.""As we investigated the incident we learned that it was caused by certain data being encrypted. We are aware of the discussion happening on social media about the type of attack we are purported to have had and the actor by whom it was apparently done,"" stated the union.

Combined Security Practices Changing the Game for Risk Management,"A significant challenge within cyber security at present is that there are a lot of risk management platforms available in the market, but only some deal with cyber risks in a very good way. The majority will shout alerts at the customer as and when they become apparent and cause great stress in the process. The issue being that by using a reactive, rather than proactive approach, many risks just sit there, dormant, until an emergency happens.'Dealing with SOC Operations for more than a decade, I have seen nearly 60 percent of SOC Incidents are repeat findings that keep re-surfacing due to underlying unmitigated Risks. Here the actors may be different, however the risk is mostly the same. This is causing significant alert fatigue.' â€“ Deodatta Wandhekar, Head of Global SOC, SecurityHQ.Combining Frameworks and Best PracticesThese risks can be prevented. A platform that combines the best practices of multiple frameworks is the solution to tackle this issue.What is NIST?The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plays a central role in presenting companies with an opportunity to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity posture to prevent or lessen the impact of cyberattacks. NIST provides a comprehensive and structured approach to assess, manage, and mitigate cybersecurity risks effectively.Read 'Building a Resilient Digital Future: NIST's Impact on Cybersecurity' for more details on NIST structures.What is MITRE?The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) framework is a knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). These TTP's are based on real-world observations, used by numerous threat actors, that have been made globally accessible to be used as the foundation for threat models and methodologies. MITRE has a 'mission to solve problems for a safer world, by bringing communities together to develop more effective security.'Read 'How the MITRE ATT&CK Framework Has Revolutionized Cyber Security' for more information on MITRE practices.What is NCSC?The National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) combines expertise from CESG (the information assurance arm of GCHQ), the Centre for Cyber Assessment, CERT-UK, and the Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure (National Protective Security Authority, NPSA). It is a London-based organization with the aim of making the UK a safer online place. They work collaboratively with other law enforcement, defense, intelligence, and security agencies and international partners to ensure their data is as accurate and actionable as possible.Risk Intelligence Combined with SHQ Response PlatformThe SHQ Response Platform from SecurityHQ started as a sophisticated cyber incident response solution designed for swift detection, analysis, and mitigation of security threats. It has now significantly evolved so that, according to a recent press release, 'SecurityHQ has combined its intellectual property and knowledge on risk mitigation and cybersecurity, and merged this with several recognized sources in the industry, including NIST, NCSC, and MITRE to provide actions on how to identify, map, and raise risks.''SHQ Response Platform will help reduce this alert fatigue by focusing on mitigating the common risk. Not just that, it will be quintessential to translate a mere one liner Risk Statement into an actionable mitigation plan. SHQ Response platform makes Risk Creation a very simple process by providing the user with a library of intricately linked Threat Events, Impacts and Controls by leveraging industry standard knowledge base of NIST, MITRE and NVD.' â€“ Deodatta Wandhekar, Head of Global SOC, security- Calculate the impact of security threats on business.- Calculate the likelihood of risks happening.- Identify different tactics and techniques.- Know how to mitigate risks.- Access everything from a single platform point.What to Do NextOrchestrate and enable collaboration, prioritize incidents, visualize risks, and empower integration with Incident Response.Calculate the impact of security threats and the likelihood of risks happening, and highlight how best to mitigate these risks with Risk Management.No matter how great a tool's capability is, remember that a tool is only as good as the experts running/controlling it.

Former CIA Engineer Sentenced to 40 Years for Leaking Classified Documents,"A former software engineer with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been sentenced to 40 years in prison by the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for transmitting classified documents to WikiLeaks and for possessing child pornographic material.Joshua Adam Schulte, 35, was originally charged in June 2018. He was found guilty in July 2022. On September 13, 2023, he was convicted on charges of receiving, possessing, and transporting child pornography. In addition to the prison term, Schulte has been sentenced to a lifetime of supervised release.""Schulte's theft is the largest data breach in the history of the CIA, and his transmission of that stolen information to WikiLeaks is one of the largest unauthorized disclosures of classified information in the history of the U.S.,"" the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said.The sensitive information shared by Schulte included a tranche of hacking tools and exploits that were denominated as Vault 7 and Vault 8. It was published by WikiLeaks starting March 7, 2017, over a period of eight months.The charges stem from Schulte's actions when he was working as a software developer in the Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) from 2012 to 2016, where he developed tools pertaining to offensive cyber operations conducted by the CIA. According to evidence presented at the trial, he abused his administrator privileges to plunder ""copies of the entire CCI tool development archives"" in 2016.This information included methods to ""collect foreign intelligence against America's adversaries,"" including an arsenal of cyber weapons and zero-day exploits that made it possible to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers, and widely-used desktop and mobile operating systems.The leak, described as a ""digital Pearl Harbor,"" cost the agency ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" and ""severely harmed U.S. national security and directly risked the lives of CIA personnel,"" prosecutors said.Schulte was also accused of repeatedly lying to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his involvement as well as ""spinning fake narratives"" about how the information could have been obtained from CIA computers in an attempt to deflect suspicion.A subsequent search of his New York apartment in March 2017 unearthed a stockpile of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) encompassing approximately 3,400 images and videos, some of which were collected during his employment with the CIA from the dark web and Russian websites.During detention pending trial, he was found to have used contraband cell phones in jail to create anonymous, encrypted email, and social media accounts, and attempted to transmit protected discovery materials to WikiLeaks and publish classified information about CIA cyber techniques and tools.Schulte's goal, the DoJ said, quoting a journal maintained by him, was to ""break up diplomatic relationships, close embassies, [and] end U.S. occupation across the world.""""Joshua Schulte was rightly punished not only for his betrayal of our country, but for his substantial possession of horrific child pornographic material,"" FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said.

Belarusian National Linked to BTC-e Faces 25 Years for $4 Billion Crypto Money Laundering,"A 42-year-old Belarusian and Cypriot national with alleged connections to the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e is facing charges related to money laundering and operating an unlicensed money services business.Aliaksandr Klimenka, who was arrested in Latvia on December 21, 2023, was extradited to the U.S. and is currently being held in custody. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.BTC-e, which had been operating since 2011, was seized by law enforcement authorities in late July 2017 following the arrest of another key member Alexander Vinnik, in Greece.The exchange is alleged to have received deposits valued at over $4 billion, with Vinnik laundering funds received from the hack of another digital exchange, Mt. Gox, through various online exchanges, including BTC-e.Court documents allege that the exchange was a ""significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity,"" allowing its users to trade in bitcoin with high levels of anonymity, thereby building a customer base that engaged in criminal activity.This included hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, and narcotics distribution rings.""BTC-e's servers, maintained in the United States, were allegedly one of the primary ways in which BTC-e and its operators effectuated their scheme,"" the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said.These servers were leased to and maintained by Klimenka and Soft-FX, a technology services company controlled by the defendant.BTC-e has also been accused of failing to establish an anti-money laundering process or know-your-customer (KYC) verification in accordance with U.S. federal laws.In June 2023, two Russian nationals â€“ Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner â€“ were charged for their roles in masterminding the 2014 digital heist of Mt. Gox.News of Klimenka's indictment comes as the DoJ charged Noah Michael Urban, 19, of Palm Coast, Florida, with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft for offenses that led to the theft of $800,000 from at least five different victims between August 2022 and March 2023.Urban, who went by the aliases Sosa, Elijah, King Bob, Anthony Ramirez, and Gustavo Fring, is said to be a key member of the cybercrime group known as Scattered Spider, according to KrebsOnSecurity, as well as a ""top member"" of a broader cybercrime ecosystem that calls itself The Com.It also follows the Justice Department's announcement of charges against three individuals, Robert Powell, Carter Rohn, and Emily Hernandez, in relation to a SIM swapping attack aimed at crypto exchange FTX to steal more than $400 million at the time of its collapse in 2022.Powell (aka R, R$, and ElSwapo1), Rohn (aka Carti and Punslayer), and Hernandez (aka Em) are accused of running a massive cybercriminal theft ring dubbed the Powell SIM Swapping Crew that orchestrated SIM swapping attacks between March 2021 and April 2023 and stole hundreds of millions of dollars from victims' accounts.Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, in October 2023, said the plunder assets had been laundered through cross-chain crime in collaboration with Russia-nexus intermediaries in an attempt to obscure the trail.",news and industry updates,news and industry updates,TRUE
"Hackers Exploit Job Boards, Stealing Millions of Resumes and Personal Data","Employment agencies and retail companies chiefly located in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region have been targeted by a previously undocumented threat actor known as ResumeLooters since early 2023 with the goal of stealing sensitive data.Singapore-headquartered Group-IB said the hacking crew's activities are geared towards job search platforms and the theft of resumes, with as many as 65 websites compromised between November 2023 and December 2023.The stolen files are estimated to contain 2,188,444 user data records, of which 510,259 have been taken from job search websites. Over two million unique email addresses are present within the dataset.""By using SQL injection attacks against websites, the threat actor attempts to steal user databases that may include names, phone numbers, emails, and DoBs, as well as information about job seekers' experience, employment history, and other sensitive personal data,"" security researcher Nikita Rostovcev said in a report shared with The Hacker News.""The stolen data is then put up for sale by the threat actor in Telegram channels.""Group-IB said it also uncovered evidence of cross-site scripting (XSS) infections on at least four legitimate job search websites that are designed to load malicious scripts responsible for displaying phishing pages capable of harvesting administrator credentials.ResumeLooters is the second hacking group after GambleForce that has been found staging SQL injection attacks in the APAC region since the latter's public disclosure in late December 2023.A majority of the compromised websites are based in India, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Australia, and Turkey, although compromises have also been reported from Brazil, the U.S., Turkey, Russia, Mexico, and Italy.The modus operandi of ResumeLooters involves the use of the open-source sqlmap tool to carry out SQL injection attacks and drop and execute additional payloads such as the BeEF (short for Browser Exploitation Framework) penetration testing tool and rogue JavaScript code designed to gather sensitive data and redirect users to credential harvesting pages.The campaign appears to be financially motivated, given the fact that ResumeLooters have set up two Telegram channels named æ¸—é€æ•°æ®ä¸­å¿ƒ and ä¸‡å›½æ•°æ®é˜¿åŠ› as of last year to sell the information.""ResumeLooters is yet another example of how much damage can be made with just a handful of publicly available tools,"" Rostovcev said. ""These attacks are fueled by poor security as well as inadequate database and website management practices.""""It is striking to see how some of the oldest yet remarkably effective SQL attacks remain prevalent in the region.

"After FBI Takedown, KV-Botnet Operators Shift Tactics in Attempt to Bounce Back","The threat actors behind the KV-botnet made ""behavioral changes"" to the malicious network as U.S. law enforcement began issuing commands to neutralize the activity.KV-botnet is the name given to a network of compromised small office and home office (SOHO) routers and firewall devices across the world, with one specific cluster acting as a covert data transfer system for other Chinese state-sponsored actors, including Volt Typhoon (aka Bronze Silhouette, Insidious Taurus, or Vanguard Panda).Active since at least February 2022, it was first documented by the Black Lotus Labs team at Lumen Technologies in mid-December 2023. The botnet is known to comprise two main sub-groups, viz. KV and JDY, with the latter principally used for scanning potential targets for reconnaissance.Late last month, the U.S. government announced a court-authorized disruption effort to take down the KV cluster, which is typically reserved for manual operations against high-profile targets chosen after broader scanning via the JDY sub-group.Now, according to new findings from the cybersecurity firm, the JDY cluster fell silent for roughly fifteen days following public disclosure and as a byproduct of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) undertaking.""In mid-December 2023, we observed this activity cluster hovering around 1,500 active bots,"" security researcher Ryan English said. ""When we sampled the size of this cluster in mid-January 2024 its size dwindled to approximately 650 bots.""Given that the takedown actions began with a signed warrant issued on December 6, 2023, it's fair to assume that the FBI began transmitting commands to routers located in the U.S. sometime on or after that date to wipe the botnet payload and prevent them from being re-infected.""We observed the KV-botnet operators begin to restructure, committing eight straight hours of activity on December 8, 2023, nearly ten hours of operations the following day on December 9, 2023, followed by one hour on December 11, 2023,"" Lumen said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.During this four-day period, the threat actor was spotted interacting with 3,045 unique IP addresses that were associated with NETGEAR ProSAFEs (2,158), Cisco RV320/325 (310), Axis IP cameras (29), DrayTek Vigor routers (17), and other unidentified devices (531).Also observed in early December 2023 was a massive spike in exploitation attempts from the payload server, indicating the adversary's likely attempts to re-exploit the devices as they detected their infrastructure going offline. Lumen said it also took steps to null-route another set of backup servers that became operational around the same time.It's worth noting that the operators of the KV-botnet are known to perform their own reconnaissance and targeting while also supporting multiple groups like Volt Typhoon. Interestingly, the timestamps associated with exploitation of the bots correlates to China working hours.""Our telemetry indicates that there were administrative connections into the known payload servers from IP addresses associated with China Telecom,"" Danny Adamitis, principal information security engineer at Black Lotus Labs, told The Hacker News.What's more, the press statement from the U.S. Justice Department described the botnet as controlled by ""People's Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored hackers.""This raises the possibility that the botnet ""was created by an organization supporting the Volt Typhoon hackers; whereas if the botnet was created by Volt Typhoon, we suspect they would have said 'nation-state' actors,"" Adamitis added.There are also signs that the threat actors established a third related-but-distinct botnet cluster dubbed x.sh as early as January 2023 that's composed of infected Cisco routers by deploying a web shell named ""fys.sh,"" as highlighted by SecurityScorecard last month.But with KV-botnet being just ""one form of infrastructure used by Volt Typhoon to obfuscate their activity,"" it's expected that the recent wave of actions will prompt the advanced persistent threat (APT) actors to presumably transition to another covert network in order to meet their strategic goals.""A significant percent of all networking equipment in use around the world is functioning perfectly well, but is no longer supported,"" English said. ""End users have a difficult financial choice when a device reaches that point, and many aren't even aware that a router or firewall is at the end of its supported life.""Advanced threat actors are well aware that this represents fertile ground for exploitation. Replacing unsupported devices is always the best choice, but not always feasible.""""Mitigation involves defenders adding their edge devices to the long list of those they already have to patch and update as often as available, rebooting devices and configuring EDR or SASE solutions where applicable, and keeping an eye on large data transfers out of the network. Geofencing is not a defense to rely on, when the threat actor can hop from a nearby point.""",news and industry updates,regulatory changes and compliance,FALSE

Critical vulnerability in Mastodon sparks patching frenzy,"Critical vulnerability in Mastodon is pounced upon by fast-acting adminsDanger of remote account takeovers leaves lead devs scared of releasing many detailsMastodon has called admins to action following the disclosure of a critical vulnerability affecting the decentralized social network favored by erstwhile Twitter lovers.With a 9.4 severity score, exploiting CVE-2024-23832 potentially allows attackers to take over Mastodon accounts remotely.While very little has been released by way of technical details â€“ allowing admins time to patch before attackers devise exploits â€“ vulnerabilities with such high CVSS scores tend to lead to severe consequences on the affected product and are often relatively easy to exploit.""Due to insufficient origin validation in all Mastodon, attackers can impersonate and take over any remote account,"" said Eugen Rochko, CEO and lead developer at Mastodon, in a security advisory.""Every Mastodon version prior to 3.5.17 is vulnerable, as well as 4.0.x versions prior to 4.0.13, 4.1.x version prior to 4.1.13, and 4.2.x versions prior to 4.2.5.""Rochko said that full details of the vulnerability will be published on February 15, giving admins two weeks to upgrade to the latest version. He said that the disclosure of ""any amount of detail would make it very easy to come up with an exploit.""Mastodon is a decentralized social network, meaning it runs on separate servers, independently owned and operated by their respective administrators.Although this brings benefits like enabling specific rules and restrictions for different communities, it also means each must be updated by the admins individually. It's not a case where the entire platform can go down for maintenance for an hour and everything is fixed.""The underlying engineering of the Mastodon platform is different than other social media networks in that it is a decentralized system,"" said Elliott Wilkes, chief technology officer at Advanced Cyber Defence Systems.""Each instance of Mastodon is hosted separately from all others, and while there are common links to allow moving between instances, they are separate, owned, and operated by different people, with different teams managing the security of each. For this reason, each instance of Mastodon requires an economy-of-scale to support its operations, including people to manage infrastructure and security engineering.""This is one of the major trade-offs between Mastodon and a centralized social media company like Meta or Instagram, there's just not the same investment in security because there's not massive revenue supporting the platform, and each owner of an instance has to perform security management on their own.""There aren't enough details here yet to say exactly why Mastodon is vulnerable and other platforms aren't but different source code repositories won't share vulnerabilities unless there is an inherent flaw in one of the open-source packages that are shared between both products.""The good news for Mastodon users is that more than half of all active servers have already upgraded to the latest version in the space of a day, according to data from fediverse network stat collector FediDB.Such a fast patch rate was likely the product of how well the Mastodon community publicized the matter. Not only was Rochko's advisory shared across different instances rapidly, but as screenshots of admin panels show, the platform itself also plastered clear warnings, making it fairly difficult to escape the urgent need to update.A quick scan of the security advisory history at Mastodon shows this isn't the only security issue the platform has had to patch over the past year, with two critical bugs, CVE-2023-36460 and CVE-2023-36459, emerging in July 2023.- How not to write about network security â€“ and I'm speaking from experience- Ivanti and Juniper Networks accused of bending the rules with CVE assignments- Asahi's Fedora remix dazzles and baffles on Apple Silicon- Polish train maker denies claims its software bricked rolling stock maintained by competitorBoth were reported by German pentesting outfit Cure53 during a Mozilla-requested audit.

EquiLend back in action as ransom payment rumors swirl,"EquiLend back in the saddle as ransom payment rumors swirlStill no word on how the intruders broke in or the full extent of any possible data compromiseGlobal securities finance tech company EquiLend's systems are now back online after announcing a disruptive ransomware attack nearly two weeks ago.EquiLend was founded in 2001 by some of Wall Street's biggest players â€“ its board of directors includes BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and more â€“ and is primarily known for its Next Generation Trading (NGT) platform, which underpins a large chunk of the sector's securities lending.The platform transacts $113.5 billion every day between more than 120 companies across more than 40 markets. The company also has regulatory tech, data analytics, and securities finance arms.Providing regular updates via a dedicated web page, EquiLend almost completed its full restoration last week, waiting only for its data and analytics solutions to get back up and running.""As our internal team and third-party experts have continued working diligently on recovery, we have reached a much-anticipated milestone: All EquiLend client-facing services are now available,"" said the Wall Street staple.""We look forward to providing the high-quality service and user experience our clients have come to expect from us across all our services, and we remain incredibly grateful for your patience and support as we worked up to this point.""We have and will continue to keep our clients informed with relevant updates. Clients whose questions are not answered by the frequently asked questions linked on this page may contact their client relationship manager.""EquiLend began the full restoration after it pulled systems offline following the discovery of the malicious behavior. According to cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont, LockBit claimed responsibility for the attack but never posted EquiLend to its leak blog, an observation he claims suggests the company negotiated a ransom payment.For clarity, it must be said that EquiLend has not commented on whether a ransom was paid or not. We contacted the business for a comment but it didn't immediately respond.A ransomware group's leak site serves as one of the key tools available to cyber extortionists. The idea is that if a ransom agreement can't be met swiftly, the victim's details are posted online so everyone knows the organization is suffering a ransomware incident.The hope, then, is that the negotiations will be hurried along before the victim's data is posted online â€“ the next move for cybercriminals looking to apply pressure to victims â€“ which can include sensitive identity documents such as passport scans of staff, for example.At the time of the incident's announcement, EquiLend was vocal about how proud it is of its ""rigorous backups,"" hinting that it may snub LockBit's demands and restore itself from those backups instead.As a company whose services are so critical to the smooth running of such a lucrative industry, EquiLend's incentive to pay would have been significant, despite the practice being strictly discouraged by the US and many other nations.The company updated its FAQ page this week to reflect the system restoration but didn't update other sections regarding questions around how the attackers broke in.Nor has EquiLend updated its communication regarding whether any data had been lifted from its systems. However, the official line appears to be carefully worded to confirm client transaction data is safe.- New kids on the ransomware block in 2023: Akira and 8Base lead dozens of newbies- Ignore Uncle Sam's 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your peril- Lurie Children's Hospital back to pen and paper after cyberattack- Interpol's latest cybercrime intervention dismantles ransomware, banking malware servers""While we are continuing to investigate, based on the review to date, we have not identified evidence that client transaction data was accessed or exfiltrated in the cybersecurity incident,"" it said. ""We will continue to share pertinent updates as they become available.""If LockBit was indeed at fault for this, its double extortion MO likely saw one of its affiliates steal a hefty chunk of data to use as leverage for ransom negotiations down the line, if it came to it.Paying a ransom never guarantees the return or destruction of data on the cybercriminals' part, nor does it guarantee the victim will be supplied with a decryptor. That said, the ransomware business model would suffer substantially if decryptors weren't given in exchange for payment.At the time of the attack, there were questions about how disruptive the attack would be, with early signs pointing to possible issues around service quality due to staff resorting to manual operations.However, experts speaking to us at the time expected minimal disruption to EquiLend's business as the effects of disrupted operations, such as revenue losses, would most likely be contained for the most part.The attack came at a difficult time for the company, a week after it announced the sale of a majority stake of its business to private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe â€“ a deal expected to close before the end of the year.

Netherlands reveals Chinese spies attacked its defense dept,"Chinese Coathanger malware hung out to dry by Dutch defense departmentAttack happened in 2023 using a bespoke backdoor, confirming year-old suspicionsDutch authorities are lifting the curtain on an attempted cyberattack last year at its Ministry of Defense (MoD), blaming Chinese state-sponsored attackers for the espionage-focused intrusion.Specialists from the Netherlands' Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) and the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) were called in to investigate an intrusion at an MOD network last year, uncovering a previously unseen malware they're calling Coathanger.The name, authorities said, was conjured up based on the ""peculiar phrase"" displayed by the malware when encrypting the configuration on disk: ""She took his coat and hung it up.""A deep dive into Coathanger's code revealed the remote access trojan (RAT) was purpose-built for Fortinet's FortiGate next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) and the initial access to the MoD's network was gained through exploiting CVE-2022-42475.According to the MIVD and AIVD, the RAT operates outside of traditional detection measures and acts as a second-stage malware, mainly to establish persistent access for attackers, surviving reboots and firmware upgrades.Even fully patched FortiGate devices could still have Coathanger installed if they were compromised before upgrading.In the cybersecurity advisory published today, authorities said the malware was highly stealthy and difficult to detect using default FortiGate CLI commands, since Coathanger hooks most system calls that could identify it as malicious.They also made clear that Coathanger is definitely different from BOLDMOVE, another RAT targeting FortiGate appliances.""For the first time, the MIVD has chosen to make public a technical report on the working methods of Chinese hackers. It is important to attribute such espionage activities by China,"" said defense minister Kajsa Ollongren in an automatically translated statement. ""In this way, we increase international resilience against this type of cyber espionage.""The advisory also noted that Dutch authorities had previously spotted Coathanger present on other victims' networks too, prior to the incident at the MOD.As for attribution, MIVD and AIVD said they can pin Coathanger to Chinese state-sponsored attackers with ""high confidence.""""MIVD and AIVD emphasize that this incident does not stand on its own, but is part of a wider trend of Chinese political espionage against the Netherlands and its allies,"" the advisory reads.- Where there's a will, there's a way to get US chips into China- China 'readies production' of homegrown high-bandwidth memory- Uncle Sam designates more Chinese tech slingers as military collaborators- Congress told how Chinese goons plan to incite 'societal chaos' in the USThe attackers responsible for the attack were known for conducting ""wide and opportunistic"" scans for exposed FortiGate appliances vulnerable to CVE-2022-42475 and then exploiting it using an obfuscated connection.After gaining an initial foothold inside the network, which was used by the MOD's research and development division, the attackers performed reconnaissance and stole a list of user accounts from the Active Directory server.Not much else was said about the attacker's activity, other than the fact that the overall impact of the intrusion was limited thanks to the MOD's network segmentation.For those worried about whether Chinese cyberspies are lurking in their firewall, the Joint Signal Cyber Unit of the Netherlands (JCSU-NL) published a full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) and various detection methods on its GitHub page.The collection of materials includes YARA rules, a JA3 hash, CLI commands, file checksums, and more. The authorities said each detection method should be seen as independent and used together since some focus on general IOCs and others were developed to spot Coathanger activity specifically.If there is evidence of compromise, it's possible other hosts that are reachable by the FortiGate device are also compromised. There is also an increased likelihood that attackers may perform hands-on-keyboard attacks.Affected users should isolate their device immediately, collect and review logs, and consider calling in third-party digital forensics specialists, the advisory reads. Victims should also inform their country's cybersecurity authority: NCSC, CISA, etc.The only way to remove Coathanger from an infected device is to completely reformat the device, before reinstalling and reconfiguring it.Whiffs of China's involvement in CVE-2022-42475 exploits have long been suspected, but for the first time they're confirmed today.First disclosed in December 2022, a month later Fortinet said it was aware that the vulnerability was tied to the breach of a government or government-related organization that had been infected with custom-made malware.At the time, no fingers were officially pointed other than the fact that this custom malware was compiled on a machine in the UTC+8 timezone, so realistically it was most likely going to be either China or Russia.China was also accused of being behind exploits of separate Fortinet bug in March, again using bespoke malware for the purposes of cyber espionage.

Fortinet FortiSIEM hit by two 10/10 severity vulns,"Double trouble for Fortinet as it issues critical FortiSIEM vulnsPlease stand by 73 hours for vendor response...*Updated Fortinet's FortiSIEM product is vulnerable to two maximum-severity security vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution, or at least according to two freshly published CVEs.*Both CVE-2024-23108 and CVE-2024-23109 have been assigned scores of 10 on the CVSS scale, suggesting exploits can be carried out remotely by unauthenticated attackers, are low in complexity, and require no user interaction to pull off.In registering the CVE identities for the vulnerabilities, Fortinet linked to its own advisory to provide more information, but the link directs users to an older issue that was addressed in early October 2023.""Multiple improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiSIEM supervisor may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute unauthorized commands via crafted API requests,"" the advisory's description of the vulnerability reads.Taking a glance at older, cached versions of the same advisory, we can see that the list of affected products has been recently updated, adding additional FortiSIEM versions. Despite Fortinet's advisory not being officially updated (yet), it suggests the two new vulnerabilities may be similar in nature to the one fixed in October, affecting newer versions of FortiSIEM.The Register asked Fortinet for clarity on the matter but did not receive a response.We also spoke to application security expert Sean Wright, who said the most recent two vulnerabilities in FortiSIEM will likely be classified as the same vulnerability from October (CVE-2023-34992), or at least a variation of it that impacts different or additional versions.Hopefully Fortinet will provide some clarity on the matter in the coming days, although discerning the differences between vulnerabilities, especially in the early days of disclosure, can often be confusing for security pros sifting through conflicting details as we are here with the yet-to-be-updated advisory.- Ivanti devices hit by wave of exploits for latest security hole- Researchers remotely exploit devices used to manage safe aircraft landings and takeoffs- Critical vulnerability in Mastodon is pounced upon by fast-acting admins- Cloudflare sheds more light on Thanksgiving security breach in which tokens, source code accessed by suspected spiesAlthough there is no known publicly available exploit code available, Fortinet customers will want to get these vulnerabilities sorted out as soon as possible given their severity.The following versions are confirmed to be vulnerable:-7.1.0 through 7.1.1-7.0.0 through 7.0.2-6.7.0 through 6.7.8-6.6.0 through 6.6.3-6.5.0 through 6.5.2-6.4.0 through 6.4.2Customers can upgrade to version 7.1.2 today and have these vulnerabilities plugged, or wait for upcoming versions if for whatever reason upgrading to the very latest version is unfeasible.Fortinet said it will be releasing new versions for 7.0.x, 6.7.x, 6.6.x, 6.5.x, and 6.4.x soon, without specifying an expected date. Â®Updated to add on February 7 2023* The vendor has since claimed in a quote to another tech outlet that the CVEs were indeed duplicated from last October, and claimed it ""issued duplicate CVEs in error.""Updated to add on February 9 2023* The company later backtracked saying that yes, actually, these are two new vulnerabilities â€“ two bypasses for October's CVE-2023-34992.

Chinese Hackers Exploited FortiGate Flaw to Breach Dutch Military Network,"Chinese state-backed hackers broke into a computer network that's used by the Dutch armed forces by targeting Fortinet FortiGate devices.""This [computer network] was used for unclassified research and development (R&D),"" the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) said in a statement. ""Because this system was self-contained, it did not lead to any damage to the defense network."" The network had less than 50 users.The intrusion, which took place in 2023, leveraged a known critical security flaw in FortiOS SSL-VPN (CVE-2022-42475, CVSS score: 9.3) that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted requests.Successful exploitation of the flaw paved the way for the deployment of a backdoor dubbed COATHANGER from an actor-controlled server that's designed to grant persistent remote access to the compromised appliances.""The COATHANGER malware is stealthy and persistent,"" the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said. ""It hides itself by hooking system calls that could reveal its presence. It survives reboots and firmware upgrades.""COATHANGER is distinct from BOLDMOVE, another backdoor linked to a suspected China-based threat actor that's known to have exploited CVE-2022-42475 as a zero-day in attacks targeting a European government entity and a managed service provider (MSP) located in Africa as early as October 2022.The development marks the first time the Netherlands has publicly attributed a cyber espionage campaign to China. Reuters, which broke the story, said the malware is named after a code snippet that contained a line from Lamb to the Slaughter, a short story by British author Roald Dahl.It also arrives days after U.S. authorities took steps to dismantle a botnet comprising out-of-date Cisco and NETGEAR routers that were used by Chinese threat actors like Volt Typhoon to conceal the origins of malicious traffic.Last year, Google-owned Mandiant revealed that a China-nexus cyber espionage group tracked as UNC3886 exploited zero-days in Fortinet appliances to deploy THINCRUST and CASTLETAP implants for executing arbitrary commands received from a remote server and exfiltrating sensitive data.",news and industry updates,data breaches and security incidents,FALSE
